class Kind(object, metaclass=KindMeta):
    """
    Base class for kinds.

    Kind of the object represents the mathematical classification that
    the entity falls into. It is expected that functions and classes
    recognize and filter the argument by its kind.

    Kind of every object must be carefully selected so that it shows the
    intention of design. Expressions may have different kind according
    to the kind of its arguments. For example, arguments of ``Add``
    must have common kind since addition is group operator, and the
    resulting ``Add()`` has the same kind.

    For the performance, each kind is as broad as possible and is not
    based on set theory. For example, ``NumberKind`` includes not only
    complex number but expression containing ``S.Infinity`` or ``S.NaN``
    which are not strictly number.

    Kind may have arguments as parameter. For example, ``MatrixKind()``
    may be constructed with one element which represents the kind of its
    elements.

    ``Kind`` behaves in singleton-like fashion. Same signature will
    return the same object.
