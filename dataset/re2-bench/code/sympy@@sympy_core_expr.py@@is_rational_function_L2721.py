class Expr(Basic, EvalfMixin):

    Base class for algebraic expressions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Everything that requires arithmetic operations to be defined
    should subclass this class, instead of Basic (which should be
    used only for argument storage and expression manipulation, i.e.
    pattern matching, substitutions, etc).

    If you want to override the comparisons of expressions:
    Should use _eval_is_ge for inequality, or _eval_is_eq, with multiple dispatch.
    _eval_is_ge return true if x >= y, false if x < y, and None if the two types
    are not comparable or the comparison is indeterminate

        The rational function does not have to be in expanded or in any kind of
        canonical form.

        This function returns False for expressions that are "rational
        functions" with symbolic exponents.  Thus, you should be able to call
        .as_numer_denom() and apply polynomial algorithms to the result for
        expressions for which this returns True.

        Not all free symbols are ``Symbol`` (see examples)

        For most expressions, all symbols are free symbols. For some classes
        this is not true. e.g. Integrals use Symbols for the dummy variables
        which are bound variables, so Integral has a method to return all
        symbols except those. Derivative keeps track of symbols with respect
        to which it will perform a derivative; those are
        bound variables, too, so it has its own free_symbols method.

        Any other method that uses bound variables should implement a
        free_symbols method.
