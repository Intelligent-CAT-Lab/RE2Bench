def _extract_patches(arr, patch_shape=8, extraction_step=1):
    """Extracts patches of any n-dimensional array in place using strides.

    Given an n-dimensional array it will return a 2n-dimensional array with
    the first n dimensions indexing patch position and the last n indexing
    the patch content. This operation is immediate (O(1)). A reshape
    performed on the first n dimensions will cause numpy to copy data, leading
    to a list of extracted patches.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <image_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        n-dimensional array of which patches are to be extracted

    patch_shape : int or tuple of length arr.ndim.default=8
        Indicates the shape of the patches to be extracted. If an
        integer is given, the shape will be a hypercube of
        sidelength given by its value.

    extraction_step : int or tuple of length arr.ndim, default=1
        Indicates step size at which extraction shall be performed.
        If integer is given, then the step is uniform in all dimensions.


    Returns
    -------
    patches : strided ndarray
        2n-dimensional array indexing patches on first n dimensions and
        containing patches on the last n dimensions. These dimensions
        are fake, but this way no data is copied. A simple reshape invokes
        a copying operation to obtain a list of patches:
        result.reshape([-1] + list(patch_shape))
