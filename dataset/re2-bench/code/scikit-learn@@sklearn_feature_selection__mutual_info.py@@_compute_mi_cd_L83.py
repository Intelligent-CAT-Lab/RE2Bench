def _compute_mi_cd(c, d, n_neighbors):
    """Compute mutual information between continuous and discrete variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
        Samples of a continuous random variable.

    d : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
        Samples of a discrete random variable.

    n_neighbors : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to search for each point, see [1]_.

    Returns
    -------
    mi : float
        Estimated mutual information in nat units. If it turned out to be
        negative it is replaced by 0.

    Notes
    -----
    True mutual information can't be negative. If its estimate by a numerical
    method is negative, it means (providing the method is adequate) that the
    mutual information is close to 0 and replacing it by 0 is a reasonable
    strategy.
