def make_pipeline(*steps, memory=None, transform_input=None, verbose=False):
    """Construct a :class:`Pipeline` from the given estimators.

    This is a shorthand for the :class:`Pipeline` constructor; it does not
    require, and does not permit, naming the estimators. Instead, their names
    will be set to the lowercase of their types automatically.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *steps : list of Estimator objects
        List of the scikit-learn estimators that are chained together.

    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
        Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. The last step
        will never be cached, even if it is a transformer. By default, no
        caching is performed. If a string is given, it is the path to the
        caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of the transformers
        before fitting. Therefore, the transformer instance given to the
        pipeline cannot be inspected directly. Use the attribute ``named_steps``
        or ``steps`` to inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the
        transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming.

    transform_input : list of str, default=None
        This enables transforming some input arguments to ``fit`` (other than ``X``)
        to be transformed by the steps of the pipeline up to the step which requires
        them. Requirement is defined via :ref:`metadata routing <metadata_routing>`.
        This can be used to pass a validation set through the pipeline for instance.

        You can only set this if metadata routing is enabled, which you
        can enable using ``sklearn.set_config(enable_metadata_routing=True)``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6

    verbose : bool, default=False
        If True, the time elapsed while fitting each step will be printed as it
        is completed.

    Returns
    -------
    p : Pipeline
        Returns a scikit-learn :class:`Pipeline` object.

        estimator.
