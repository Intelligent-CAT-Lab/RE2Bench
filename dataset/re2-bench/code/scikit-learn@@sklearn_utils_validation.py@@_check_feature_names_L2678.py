    .. versionadded:: 1.0

    .. versionchanged:: 1.6
        Moved from :class:`~sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` to
        :mod:`sklearn.utils.validation`.

    .. note::
        To only check feature names without conducting a full data validation, prefer
        using `validate_data(..., skip_check_array=True)` if possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator instance
        The estimator to validate the input for.

    X : {ndarray, dataframe} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The input samples.

    reset : bool
        Whether to reset the `feature_names_in_` attribute.
        If True, resets the `feature_names_in_` attribute as inferred from `X`.
        If False, the input will be checked for consistency with
        feature names of data provided when reset was last True.

        .. note::
           It is recommended to call `reset=True` in `fit` and in the first
           call to `partial_fit`. All other methods that validate `X`
           should set `reset=False`.
