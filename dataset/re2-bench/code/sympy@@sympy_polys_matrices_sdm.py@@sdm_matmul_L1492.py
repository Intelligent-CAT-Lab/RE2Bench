    #
    # The idea here is that we compute C = A*B in terms of the rows of C and
    # B since the dict of dicts representation naturally stores the matrix as
    # rows. The ith row of C (Ci) is equal to the sum of Aik * Bk where Bk is
    # the kth row of B. The algorithm below loops over each nonzero element
    # Aik of A and if the corresponding row Bj is nonzero then we do
    #    Ci += Aik * Bk.
    # To make this more efficient we don't need to loop over all elements Aik.
    # Instead for each row Ai we compute the intersection of the nonzero
    # columns in Ai with the nonzero rows in B. That gives the k such that
    # Aik and Bk are both nonzero. In Python the intersection of two sets
    # of int can be computed very efficiently.
