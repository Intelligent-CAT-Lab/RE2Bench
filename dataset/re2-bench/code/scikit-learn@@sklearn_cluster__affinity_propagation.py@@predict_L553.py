class AffinityPropagation(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Perform Affinity Propagation Clustering of data.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <affinity_propagation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    damping : float, default=0.5
        Damping factor in the range `[0.5, 1.0)` is the extent to
        which the current value is maintained relative to
        incoming values (weighted 1 - damping). This in order
        to avoid numerical oscillations when updating these
        values (messages).

    max_iter : int, default=200
        Maximum number of iterations.

    convergence_iter : int, default=15
        Number of iterations with no change in the number
        of estimated clusters that stops the convergence.

    copy : bool, default=True
        Make a copy of input data.

    preference : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or float, default=None
        Preferences for each point - points with larger values of
        preferences are more likely to be chosen as exemplars. The number
        of exemplars, ie of clusters, is influenced by the input
        preferences value. If the preferences are not passed as arguments,
        they will be set to the median of the input similarities.

    affinity : {'euclidean', 'precomputed'}, default='euclidean'
        Which affinity to use. At the moment 'precomputed' and
        ``euclidean`` are supported. 'euclidean' uses the
        negative squared euclidean distance between points.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether to be verbose.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Pseudo-random number generator to control the starting state.
        Use an int for reproducible results across function calls.
        See the :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23
            this parameter was previously hardcoded as 0.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_indices_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters,)
        Indices of cluster centers.

    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Cluster centers (if affinity != ``precomputed``).

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point.

    affinity_matrix_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Stores the affinity matrix used in ``fit``.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations taken to converge.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    See Also
    --------
    AgglomerativeClustering : Recursively merges the pair of
        clusters that minimally increases a given linkage distance.
    FeatureAgglomeration : Similar to AgglomerativeClustering,
        but recursively merges features instead of samples.
    KMeans : K-Means clustering.
    MiniBatchKMeans : Mini-Batch K-Means clustering.
    MeanShift : Mean shift clustering using a flat kernel.
    SpectralClustering : Apply clustering to a projection
        of the normalized Laplacian.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithmic complexity of affinity propagation is quadratic
    in the number of points.

    When the algorithm does not converge, it will still return an array of
    ``cluster_center_indices`` and labels if there are any exemplars/clusters,
    however they may be degenerate and should be used with caution.

    When ``fit`` does not converge, ``cluster_centers_`` is still populated
    however it may be degenerate. In such a case, proceed with caution.
    If ``fit`` does not converge and fails to produce any ``cluster_centers_``
    then ``predict`` will label every sample as ``-1``.

    When all training samples have equal similarities and equal preferences,
    the assignment of cluster centers and labels depends on the preference.
    If the preference is smaller than the similarities, ``fit`` will result in
    a single cluster center and label ``0`` for every sample. Otherwise, every
    training sample becomes its own cluster center and is assigned a unique
    label.
