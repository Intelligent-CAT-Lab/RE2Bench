def is_ge(lhs, rhs, assumptions=None):

    Fuzzy bool for *lhs* is greater than or equal to *rhs*.

    Parameters
    ==========

    lhs : Expr
        The left-hand side of the expression, must be sympified,
        and an instance of expression. Throws an exception if
        lhs is not an instance of expression.

    rhs : Expr
        The right-hand side of the expression, must be sympified
        and an instance of expression. Throws an exception if
        lhs is not an instance of expression.

    assumptions: Boolean, optional
        Assumptions taken to evaluate the inequality.

    Returns
    =======

    ``True`` if *lhs* is greater than or equal to *rhs*, ``False`` if *lhs*
    is less than *rhs*, and ``None`` if the comparison between *lhs* and
    *rhs* is indeterminate.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function is intended to give a relatively fast determination and
    deliberately does not attempt slow calculations that might help in
    obtaining a determination of True or False in more difficult cases.

    The four comparison functions ``is_le``, ``is_lt``, ``is_ge``, and ``is_gt`` are
    each implemented in terms of ``is_ge`` in the following way:

    is_ge(x, y) := is_ge(x, y)
    is_le(x, y) := is_ge(y, x)
    is_lt(x, y) := fuzzy_not(is_ge(x, y))
    is_gt(x, y) := fuzzy_not(is_ge(y, x))

    Therefore, supporting new type with this function will ensure behavior for
    other three functions as well.

    To maintain these equivalences in fuzzy logic it is important that in cases where
    either x or y is non-real all comparisons will give None.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, Q
    >>> from sympy.core.relational import is_ge, is_le, is_gt, is_lt
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> is_ge(S(2), S(0))
    True
    >>> is_ge(S(0), S(2))
    False
    >>> is_le(S(0), S(2))
    True
    >>> is_gt(S(0), S(2))
    False
    >>> is_lt(S(2), S(0))
    False

    Assumptions can be passed to evaluate the quality which is otherwise
    indeterminate.

    >>> print(is_ge(x, S(0)))
    None
    >>> is_ge(x, S(0), assumptions=Q.positive(x))
    True

    New types can be supported by dispatching to ``_eval_is_ge``.

    >>> from sympy import Expr, sympify
    >>> from sympy.multipledispatch import dispatch
