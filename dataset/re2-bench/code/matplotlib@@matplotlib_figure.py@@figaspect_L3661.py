def figaspect(arg):
    """
    Calculate the width and height for a figure with a specified aspect ratio.

    While the height is taken from :rc:`figure.figsize`, the width is
    adjusted to match the desired aspect ratio. Additionally, it is ensured
    that the width is in the range [4., 16.] and the height is in the range
    [2., 16.]. If necessary, the default height is adjusted to ensure this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg : float or 2D array
        If a float, this defines the aspect ratio (i.e. the ratio height /
        width).
        In case of an array the aspect ratio is number of rows / number of
        columns, so that the array could be fitted in the figure undistorted.

    Returns
    -------
    size : (2,) array
        The width and height of the figure in inches.

    Notes
    -----
    If you want to create an Axes within the figure, that still preserves the
    aspect ratio, be sure to create it with equal width and height. See
    examples below.

    Thanks to Fernando Perez for this function.

    Examples
    --------
    Make a figure twice as tall as it is wide::

        w, h = figaspect(2.)
        fig = Figure(figsize=(w, h))
        ax = fig.add_axes((0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8))
        ax.imshow(A, **kwargs)

    Make a figure with the proper aspect for an array::

        A = rand(5, 3)
        w, h = figaspect(A)
        fig = Figure(figsize=(w, h))
        ax = fig.add_axes((0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8))
        ax.imshow(A, **kwargs)
