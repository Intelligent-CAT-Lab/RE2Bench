class Rational(Number):
    """Represents rational numbers (p/q) of any size.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Rational, nsimplify, S, pi
    >>> Rational(1, 2)
    1/2

    Rational is unprejudiced in accepting input. If a float is passed, the
    underlying value of the binary representation will be returned:

    >>> Rational(.5)
    1/2
    >>> Rational(.2)
    3602879701896397/18014398509481984

    If the simpler representation of the float is desired then consider
    limiting the denominator to the desired value or convert the float to
    a string (which is roughly equivalent to limiting the denominator to
    10**12):

    >>> Rational(str(.2))
    1/5
    >>> Rational(.2).limit_denominator(10**12)
    1/5

    An arbitrarily precise Rational is obtained when a string literal is
    passed:

    >>> Rational("1.23")
    123/100
    >>> Rational('1e-2')
    1/100
    >>> Rational(".1")
    1/10
    >>> Rational('1e-2/3.2')
    1/320

    The conversion of other types of strings can be handled by
    the sympify() function, and conversion of floats to expressions
    or simple fractions can be handled with nsimplify:

    >>> S('.[3]')  # repeating digits in brackets
    1/3
    >>> S('3**2/10')  # general expressions
    9/10
    >>> nsimplify(.3)  # numbers that have a simple form
    3/10

    But if the input does not reduce to a literal Rational, an error will
    be raised:

    >>> Rational(pi)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: invalid input: pi


    Low-level
    ---------

    Access numerator and denominator as .p and .q:

    >>> r = Rational(3, 4)
    >>> r
    3/4
    >>> r.p
    3
    >>> r.q
    4

    Note that p and q return integers (not SymPy Integers) so some care
    is needed when using them in expressions:

    >>> r.p/r.q
    0.75
