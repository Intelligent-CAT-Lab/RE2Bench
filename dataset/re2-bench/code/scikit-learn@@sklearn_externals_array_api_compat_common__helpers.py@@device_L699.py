def device(x: _ArrayApiObj, /) -> Device:
    """
    Hardware device the array data resides on.

    This is equivalent to `x.device` according to the `standard
    <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/generated/array_api.array.device.html>`__.
    This helper is included because some array libraries either do not have
    the `device` attribute or include it with an incompatible API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        array instance from an array API compatible library.

    Returns
    -------
    out: device
        a ``device`` object (see the `Device Support <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/design_topics/device_support.html>`__
        section of the array API specification).

    Notes
    -----

    For NumPy the device is always `"cpu"`. For Dask, the device is always a
    special `DASK_DEVICE` object.
