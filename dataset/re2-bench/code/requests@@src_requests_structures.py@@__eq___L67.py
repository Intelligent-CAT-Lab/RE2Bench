class CaseInsensitiveDict(MutableMapping):
    """A case-insensitive ``dict``-like object.

    Implements all methods and operations of
    ``MutableMapping`` as well as dict's ``copy``. Also
    provides ``lower_items``.

    All keys are expected to be strings. The structure remembers the
    case of the last key to be set, and ``iter(instance)``,
    ``keys()``, ``items()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``iteritems()``
    will contain case-sensitive keys. However, querying and contains
    testing is case insensitive::

        cid = CaseInsensitiveDict()
        cid['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        cid['aCCEPT'] == 'application/json'  # True
        list(cid) == ['Accept']  # True

    For example, ``headers['content-encoding']`` will return the
    value of a ``'Content-Encoding'`` response header, regardless
    of how the header name was originally stored.

    If the constructor, ``.update``, or equality comparison
    operations are given keys that have equal ``.lower()``s, the
    behavior is undefined.
