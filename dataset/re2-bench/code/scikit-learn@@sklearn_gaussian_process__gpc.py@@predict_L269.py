class _BinaryGaussianProcessClassifierLaplace(BaseEstimator):
    """Binary Gaussian process classification based on Laplace approximation.

    The implementation is based on Algorithm 3.1, 3.2, and 5.1 from [RW2006]_.

    Internally, the Laplace approximation is used for approximating the
    non-Gaussian posterior by a Gaussian.

    Currently, the implementation is restricted to using the logistic link
    function.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the GP. If None is
        passed, the kernel "1.0 * RBF(1.0)" is used as default. Note that
        the kernel's hyperparameters are optimized during fitting.

    optimizer : 'fmin_l_bfgs_b' or callable, default='fmin_l_bfgs_b'
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel's parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the  signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * 'obj_func' is the objective function to be maximized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

        Per default, the 'L-BFGS-B' algorithm from scipy.optimize.minimize
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel's parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are::

            'fmin_l_bfgs_b'

    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel's
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel's initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that n_restarts_optimizer=0 implies that one
        run is performed.

    max_iter_predict : int, default=100
        The maximum number of iterations in Newton's method for approximating
        the posterior during predict. Smaller values will reduce computation
        time at the cost of worse results.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If warm-starts are enabled, the solution of the last Newton iteration
        on the Laplace approximation of the posterior mode is used as
        initialization for the next call of _posterior_mode(). This can speed
        up convergence when _posterior_mode is called several times on similar
        problems as in hyperparameter optimization. See :term:`the Glossary
        <warm_start>`.

    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    X_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or list of object
        Feature vectors or other representations of training data (also
        required for prediction).

    y_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Target values in training data (also required for prediction)

    classes_ : array-like of shape (n_classes,)
        Unique class labels.

    kernel_ : kernl instance
        The kernel used for prediction. The structure of the kernel is the
        same as the one passed as parameter but with optimized hyperparameters

    L_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition of the kernel in X_train_

    pi_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        The probabilities of the positive class for the training points
        X_train_

    W_sr_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Square root of W, the Hessian of log-likelihood of the latent function
        values for the observed labels. Since W is diagonal, only the diagonal
        of sqrt(W) is stored.

    log_marginal_likelihood_value_ : float
        The log-marginal-likelihood of ``self.kernel_.theta``
