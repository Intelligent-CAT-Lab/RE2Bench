class Equality(Relational):
    """
    An equal relation between two objects.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Represents that two objects are equal.  If they can be easily shown
    to be definitively equal (or unequal), this will reduce to True (or
    False).  Otherwise, the relation is maintained as an unevaluated
    Equality object.  Use the ``simplify`` function on this object for
    more nontrivial evaluation of the equality relation.

    As usual, the keyword argument ``evaluate=False`` can be used to
    prevent any evaluation.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Eq, simplify, exp, cos
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Eq(y, x + x**2)
    Eq(y, x**2 + x)
    >>> Eq(2, 5)
    False
    >>> Eq(2, 5, evaluate=False)
    Eq(2, 5)
    >>> _.doit()
    False
    >>> Eq(exp(x), exp(x).rewrite(cos))
    Eq(exp(x), sinh(x) + cosh(x))
    >>> simplify(_)
    True

    Notes
    =====

    Python treats 1 and True (and 0 and False) as being equal; SymPy
    does not. And integer will always compare as unequal to a Boolean:

    >>> Eq(True, 1), True == 1
    (False, True)

    This class is not the same as the == operator.  The == operator tests
    for exact structural equality between two expressions; this class
    compares expressions mathematically.

    If either object defines an ``_eval_Eq`` method, it can be used in place of
    the default algorithm.  If ``lhs._eval_Eq(rhs)`` or ``rhs._eval_Eq(lhs)``
    returns anything other than None, that return value will be substituted for
    the Equality.  If None is returned by ``_eval_Eq``, an Equality object will
    be created as usual.

    Since this object is already an expression, it does not respond to
    the method ``as_expr`` if one tries to create `x - y` from ``Eq(x, y)``.
    If ``eq = Eq(x, y)`` then write `eq.lhs - eq.rhs` to get ``x - y``.

    .. deprecated:: 1.5

       ``Eq(expr)`` with a single argument is a shorthand for ``Eq(expr, 0)``,
       but this behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
       of SymPy.
