class DomainMatrix:
    """
    Associate Matrix with :py:class:`~.Domain`

    Explanation
    ===========

    DomainMatrix uses :py:class:`~.Domain` for its internal representation
    which makes it faster than the SymPy Matrix class (currently) for many
    common operations, but this advantage makes it not entirely compatible
    with Matrix. DomainMatrix are analogous to numpy arrays with "dtype".
    In the DomainMatrix, each element has a domain such as :ref:`ZZ`
    or  :ref:`QQ(a)`.


    Examples
    ========

    Creating a DomainMatrix from the existing Matrix class:

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
    >>> Matrix1 = Matrix([
    ...    [1, 2],
    ...    [3, 4]])
    >>> A = DomainMatrix.from_Matrix(Matrix1)
    >>> A
    DomainMatrix({0: {0: 1, 1: 2}, 1: {0: 3, 1: 4}}, (2, 2), ZZ)

    Directly forming a DomainMatrix:

    >>> from sympy import ZZ
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
    >>> A = DomainMatrix([
    ...    [ZZ(1), ZZ(2)],
    ...    [ZZ(3), ZZ(4)]], (2, 2), ZZ)
    >>> A
    DomainMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]], (2, 2), ZZ)

        Convert :class:`DomainMatrix` to dictionary of keys (dok) format.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import ZZ
        >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
        >>> A = DomainMatrix([
        ...    [ZZ(1), ZZ(0)],
        ...    [ZZ(0), ZZ(4)]], (2, 2), ZZ)
        >>> A.to_dok()
        {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 4}

        The matrix can be reconstructed by calling :meth:`from_dok` although
        the reconstructed matrix will always be in sparse format:

        >>> A.to_sparse() == A.from_dok(A.to_dok(), A.shape, A.domain)
        True
