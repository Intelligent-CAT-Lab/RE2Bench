class SpectralClustering(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

    In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
    the individual clusters is highly non-convex, or more generally when
    a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
    description of the complete cluster, such as when clusters are
    nested circles on the 2D plane.

    If the affinity matrix is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method
    can be used to find normalized graph cuts [1]_, [2]_.

    When calling ``fit``, an affinity matrix is constructed using either
    a kernel function such the Gaussian (aka RBF) kernel with Euclidean
    distance ``d(X, X)``::

            np.exp(-gamma * d(X,X) ** 2)

    or a k-nearest neighbors connectivity matrix.

    Alternatively, a user-provided affinity matrix can be specified by
    setting ``affinity='precomputed'``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {'arpack', 'lobpcg', 'amg'}, default=None
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities. If None, then ``'arpack'`` is
        used. See [4]_ for more details regarding `'lobpcg'`.

    n_components : int, default=None
        Number of eigenvectors to use for the spectral embedding. If None,
        defaults to `n_clusters`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization
        of the lobpcg eigenvectors decomposition when `eigen_solver ==
        'amg'`, and for the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make
        the results deterministic across calls (See
        :term:`Glossary <random_state>`).

        .. note::
            When using `eigen_solver == 'amg'`,
            it is necessary to also fix the global numpy seed with
            `np.random.seed(int)` to get deterministic results. See
            https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg/issues/139 for further
            information.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia. Only used if
        ``assign_labels='kmeans'``.

    gamma : float, default=1.0
        Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid, laplacian and chi2 kernels.
        Ignored for ``affinity='nearest_neighbors'``, ``affinity='precomputed'``
        or ``affinity='precomputed_nearest_neighbors'``.

    affinity : str or callable, default='rbf'
        How to construct the affinity matrix.
         - 'nearest_neighbors': construct the affinity matrix by computing a
           graph of nearest neighbors.
         - 'rbf': construct the affinity matrix using a radial basis function
           (RBF) kernel.
         - 'precomputed': interpret ``X`` as a precomputed affinity matrix,
           where larger values indicate greater similarity between instances.
         - 'precomputed_nearest_neighbors': interpret ``X`` as a sparse graph
           of precomputed distances, and construct a binary affinity matrix
           from the ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors of each instance.
         - one of the kernels supported by
           :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels`.

        Only kernels that produce similarity scores (non-negative values that
        increase with similarity) should be used. This property is not checked
        by the clustering algorithm.

    n_neighbors : int, default=10
        Number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix using
        the nearest neighbors method. Ignored for ``affinity='rbf'``.

    eigen_tol : float, default="auto"
        Stopping criterion for eigen decomposition of the Laplacian matrix.
        If `eigen_tol="auto"` then the passed tolerance will depend on the
        `eigen_solver`:

        - If `eigen_solver="arpack"`, then `eigen_tol=0.0`;
        - If `eigen_solver="lobpcg"` or `eigen_solver="amg"`, then
          `eigen_tol=None` which configures the underlying `lobpcg` solver to
          automatically resolve the value according to their heuristics. See,
          :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lobpcg` for details.

        Note that when using `eigen_solver="lobpcg"` or `eigen_solver="amg"`
        values of `tol<1e-5` may lead to convergence issues and should be
        avoided.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           Added 'auto' option.

    assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize', 'cluster_qr'}, default='kmeans'
        The strategy for assigning labels in the embedding space. There are two
        ways to assign labels after the Laplacian embedding. k-means is a
        popular choice, but it can be sensitive to initialization.
        Discretization is another approach which is less sensitive to random
        initialization [3]_.
        The cluster_qr method [5]_ directly extract clusters from eigenvectors
        in spectral clustering. In contrast to k-means and discretization, cluster_qr
        has no tuning parameters and runs no iterations, yet may outperform
        k-means and discretization in terms of both quality and speed.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
           Added new labeling method 'cluster_qr'.

    degree : float, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : dict of str to any, default=None
        Parameters (keyword arguments) and values for kernel passed as
        callable object. Ignored by other kernels.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run when `affinity='nearest_neighbors'`
        or `affinity='precomputed_nearest_neighbors'`. The neighbors search
        will be done in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    affinity_matrix_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Affinity matrix used for clustering. Available only after calling
        ``fit``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    Notes
    -----
    A distance matrix for which 0 indicates identical elements and high values
    indicate very dissimilar elements can be transformed into an affinity /
    similarity matrix that is well-suited for the algorithm by
    applying the Gaussian (aka RBF, heat) kernel::

        np.exp(- dist_matrix ** 2 / (2. * delta ** 2))

    where ``delta`` is a free parameter representing the width of the Gaussian
    kernel.

    An alternative is to take a symmetric version of the k-nearest neighbors
    connectivity matrix of the points.

    If the pyamg package is installed, it is used: this greatly
    speeds up computation.
