def _fetch_remote(remote, dirname=None, n_retries=3, delay=1):
    """Helper function to download a remote dataset.

    Fetch a dataset pointed by remote's url, save into path using remote's
    filename and ensure its integrity based on the SHA256 checksum of the
    downloaded file.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.6

        If the file already exists locally and the SHA256 checksums match, the
        path to the local file is returned without re-downloading.

    Parameters
    ----------
    remote : RemoteFileMetadata
        Named tuple containing remote dataset meta information: url, filename
        and checksum.

    dirname : str or Path, default=None
        Directory to save the file to. If None, the current working directory
        is used.

    n_retries : int, default=3
        Number of retries when HTTP errors are encountered.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5

    delay : int, default=1
        Number of seconds between retries.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5

    Returns
    -------
    file_path: Path
        Full path of the created file.
