    A field metadata class to indicate that a field should be validated in strict mode.

    Attributes:
        strict: Whether to validate the field in strict mode.

    Example:
        ```python
        from typing import Annotated

        from pydantic.types import Strict

        StrictBool = Annotated[bool, Strict()]
        ```

    strict: bool = True

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self.strict)
