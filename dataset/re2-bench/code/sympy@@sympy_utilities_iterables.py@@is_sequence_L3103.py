def is_sequence(i, include=None):
    """
    Return a boolean indicating whether ``i`` is a sequence in the SymPy
    sense. If anything that fails the test below should be included as
    being a sequence for your application, set 'include' to that object's
    type; multiple types should be passed as a tuple of types.

    Note: although generators can generate a sequence, they often need special
    handling to make sure their elements are captured before the generator is
    exhausted, so these are not included by default in the definition of a
    sequence.
