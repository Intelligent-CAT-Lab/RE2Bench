def sift(seq, keyfunc, binary=False):
    """
    Sift the sequence, ``seq`` according to ``keyfunc``.

    Returns
    =======

    When ``binary`` is ``False`` (default), the output is a dictionary
    where elements of ``seq`` are stored in a list keyed to the value
    of keyfunc for that element. If ``binary`` is True then a tuple
    with lists ``T`` and ``F`` are returned where ``T`` is a list
    containing elements of seq for which ``keyfunc`` was ``True`` and
    ``F`` containing those elements for which ``keyfunc`` was ``False``;
    a ValueError is raised if the ``keyfunc`` is not binary.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities import sift
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> from sympy import sqrt, exp, pi, Tuple

    >>> sift(range(5), lambda x: x % 2)
    {0: [0, 2, 4], 1: [1, 3]}

    sift() returns a defaultdict() object, so any key that has no matches will
    give [].

    >>> sift([x], lambda x: x.is_commutative)
    {True: [x]}
    >>> _[False]
    []

    Sometimes you will not know how many keys you will get:

    >>> sift([sqrt(x), exp(x), (y**x)**2],
    ...      lambda x: x.as_base_exp()[0])
    {E: [exp(x)], x: [sqrt(x)], y: [y**(2*x)]}

    Sometimes you expect the results to be binary; the
    results can be unpacked by setting ``binary`` to True:

    >>> sift(range(4), lambda x: x % 2, binary=True)
    ([1, 3], [0, 2])
    >>> sift(Tuple(1, pi), lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)
    ([1], [pi])

    A ValueError is raised if the predicate was not actually binary
    (which is a good test for the logic where sifting is used and
    binary results were expected):

    >>> unknown = exp(1) - pi  # the rationality of this is unknown
    >>> args = Tuple(1, pi, unknown)
    >>> sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: keyfunc gave non-binary output

    The non-binary sifting shows that there were 3 keys generated:

    >>> set(sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational).keys())
    {None, False, True}

    If you need to sort the sifted items it might be better to use
    ``ordered`` which can economically apply multiple sort keys
    to a sequence while sorting.
