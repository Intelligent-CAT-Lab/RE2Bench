class Expr(Basic, EvalfMixin):

    Base class for algebraic expressions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Everything that requires arithmetic operations to be defined
    should subclass this class, instead of Basic (which should be
    used only for argument storage and expression manipulation, i.e.
    pattern matching, substitutions, etc).

    If you want to override the comparisons of expressions:
    Should use _eval_is_ge for inequality, or _eval_is_eq, with multiple dispatch.
    _eval_is_ge return true if x >= y, false if x < y, and None if the two types
    are not comparable or the comparison is indeterminate

        Explanation
        ===========

        The random complex value for each free symbol is generated
        by the random_complex_number routine giving real and imaginary
        parts in the range given by the re_min, re_max, im_min, and im_max
        values. The returned value is evaluated to a precision of n
        (if given) else the maximum of 15 and the precision needed
        to get more than 1 digit of precision. If the expression
        could not be evaluated to a number, or could not be evaluated
        to more than 1 digit of precision, then None is returned.

        Not all free symbols are ``Symbol`` (see examples)

        For most expressions, all symbols are free symbols. For some classes
        this is not true. e.g. Integrals use Symbols for the dummy variables
        which are bound variables, so Integral has a method to return all
        symbols except those. Derivative keeps track of symbols with respect
        to which it will perform a derivative; those are
        bound variables, too, so it has its own free_symbols method.

        Any other method that uses bound variables should implement a
        free_symbols method.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Derivative, Integral, IndexedBase
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, n
        >>> (x + 1).free_symbols
        {x}
        >>> Integral(x, y).free_symbols
        {x, y}

        Not all free symbols are actually symbols:

        >>> IndexedBase('F')[0].free_symbols
        {F, F[0]}

        The symbols of differentiation are not included unless they
        appear in the expression being differentiated.

        >>> Derivative(x + y, y).free_symbols
        {x, y}

        {x}
        >>> Derivative(x, (y, n)).free_symbols

        If you want to know if a symbol is in the variables of the
        Derivative you can do so as follows:
