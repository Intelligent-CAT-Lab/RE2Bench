from sympy.core.singleton import Singleton, S

class BooleanTrue(BooleanAtom, metaclass=Singleton):
    """
    SymPy version of ``True``, a singleton that can be accessed via ``S.true``.

    This is the SymPy version of ``True``, for use in the logic module. The
    primary advantage of using ``true`` instead of ``True`` is that shorthand Boolean
    operations like ``~`` and ``>>`` will work as expected on this class, whereas with
    True they act bitwise on 1. Functions in the logic module will return this
    class when they evaluate to true.

    Notes
    =====

    There is liable to be some confusion as to when ``True`` should
    be used and when ``S.true`` should be used in various contexts
    throughout SymPy. An important thing to remember is that
    ``sympify(True)`` returns ``S.true``. This means that for the most
    part, you can just use ``True`` and it will automatically be converted
    to ``S.true`` when necessary, similar to how you can generally use 1
    instead of ``S.One``.

    The rule of thumb is:

    "If the boolean in question can be replaced by an arbitrary symbolic
    ``Boolean``, like ``Or(x, y)`` or ``x > 1``, use ``S.true``.
    Otherwise, use ``True``"

    In other words, use ``S.true`` only on those contexts where the
    boolean is being used as a symbolic representation of truth.
    For example, if the object ends up in the ``.args`` of any expression,
    then it must necessarily be ``S.true`` instead of ``True``, as
    elements of ``.args`` must be ``Basic``. On the other hand,
    ``==`` is not a symbolic operation in SymPy, since it always returns
    ``True`` or ``False``, and does so in terms of structural equality
    rather than mathematical, so it should return ``True``. The assumptions
    system should use ``True`` and ``False``. Aside from not satisfying
    the above rule of thumb, the assumptions system uses a three-valued logic
    (``True``, ``False``, ``None``), whereas ``S.true`` and ``S.false``
    represent a two-valued logic. When in doubt, use ``True``.

    "``S.true == True is True``."

    While "``S.true is True``" is ``False``, "``S.true == True``"
    is ``True``, so if there is any doubt over whether a function or
    expression will return ``S.true`` or ``True``, just use ``==``
    instead of ``is`` to do the comparison, and it will work in either
    case.  Finally, for boolean flags, it's better to just use ``if x``
    instead of ``if x is True``. To quote PEP 8:

    Do not compare boolean values to ``True`` or ``False``
    using ``==``.

    * Yes:   ``if greeting:``
    * No:    ``if greeting == True:``
    * Worse: ``if greeting is True:``

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sympify, true, false, Or
    >>> sympify(True)
    True
    >>> _ is True, _ is true
    (False, True)

    >>> Or(true, false)
    True
    >>> _ is true
    True

    Python operators give a boolean result for true but a
    bitwise result for True

    >>> ~true, ~True  # doctest: +SKIP
    (False, -2)
    >>> true >> true, True >> True
    (True, 0)
