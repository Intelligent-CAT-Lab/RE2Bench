def _check_multimetric_scoring(estimator, scoring):
    """Check the scoring parameter in cases when multiple metrics are allowed.

    In addition, multimetric scoring leverages a caching mechanism to not call the same
    estimator response method multiple times. Hence, the scorer is modified to only use
    a single response method given a list of response methods and the estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : sklearn estimator instance
        The estimator for which the scoring will be applied.

    scoring : list, tuple or dict
        Strategy to evaluate the performance of the cross-validated model on
        the test set.

        The possibilities are:

        - a list or tuple of unique strings;
        - a callable returning a dictionary where they keys are the metric
          names and the values are the metric scores;
        - a dictionary with metric names as keys and callables a values.

        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.

    Returns
    -------
    scorers_dict : dict
        A dict mapping each scorer name to its validated scorer.
