class Path:
    """
    A series of possibly disconnected, possibly closed, line and curve
    segments.

    The underlying storage is made up of two parallel numpy arrays:

    - *vertices*: an (N, 2) float array of vertices
    - *codes*: an N-length `numpy.uint8` array of path codes, or None

    These two arrays always have the same length in the first
    dimension.  For example, to represent a cubic curve, you must
    provide three vertices and three `CURVE4` codes.

    The code types are:

    - `STOP`   :  1 vertex (ignored)
        A marker for the end of the entire path (currently not required and
        ignored)

    - `MOVETO` :  1 vertex
        Pick up the pen and move to the given vertex.

    - `LINETO` :  1 vertex
        Draw a line from the current position to the given vertex.

    - `CURVE3` :  1 control point, 1 endpoint
        Draw a quadratic Bézier curve from the current position, with the given
        control point, to the given end point.

    - `CURVE4` :  2 control points, 1 endpoint
        Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current position, with the given
        control points, to the given end point.

    - `CLOSEPOLY` : 1 vertex (ignored)
        Draw a line segment to the start point of the current polyline.

    If *codes* is None, it is interpreted as a `MOVETO` followed by a series
    of `LINETO`.

    Users of Path objects should not access the vertices and codes arrays
    directly.  Instead, they should use `iter_segments` or `cleaned` to get the
    vertex/code pairs.  This helps, in particular, to consistently handle the
    case of *codes* being None.

    Some behavior of Path objects can be controlled by rcParams. See the
    rcParams whose keys start with 'path.'.

    .. note::

        The vertices and codes arrays should be treated as
        immutable -- there are a number of optimizations and assumptions
        made up front in the constructor that will not change when the
        data changes.

        Create a new path with the given vertices and codes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        vertices : (N, 2) array-like
            The path vertices, as an array, masked array or sequence of pairs.
            Masked values, if any, will be converted to NaNs, which are then
            handled correctly by the Agg PathIterator and other consumers of
            path data, such as :meth:`iter_segments`.
        codes : array-like or None, optional
            N-length array of integers representing the codes of the path.
            If not None, codes must be the same length as vertices.
            If None, *vertices* will be treated as a series of line segments.
        _interpolation_steps : int, optional
            Used as a hint to certain projections, such as Polar, that this
            path should be linearly interpolated immediately before drawing.
            This attribute is primarily an implementation detail and is not
            intended for public use.
        closed : bool, optional
            If *codes* is None and closed is True, vertices will be treated as
            line segments of a closed polygon.  Note that the last vertex will
            then be ignored (as the corresponding code will be set to
            `CLOSEPOLY`).
        readonly : bool, optional
            Makes the path behave in an immutable way and sets the vertices
            and codes as read-only arrays.

        `CLOSEPOLY` an implicit segment connecting the last vertex to the first
        vertex is assumed.

        ----------
        points : (N, 2) array
            The points to check. Columns contain x and y values.
        transform : `~matplotlib.transforms.Transform`, optional

            by *transform*; i.e. for a correct check, *transform* should

        radius : float, default: 0
            Additional margin on the path in coordinates of *points*.
            The path is extended tangentially by *radius/2*; i.e. if you would
            draw the path with a linewidth of *radius*, all points on the line
            would still be considered to be contained in the area. Conversely,
            negative values shrink the area: Points on the imaginary line
            will be considered outside the area.

        - The result is undefined if there is no enclosed area, i.e. all
          vertices are on a straight line.
        - If bounding lines start to cross each other due to *radius* shift,
          the result is not guaranteed to be correct.
