class DomainMatrix:
    """
    Associate Matrix with :py:class:`~.Domain`

    Explanation
    ===========

    DomainMatrix uses :py:class:`~.Domain` for its internal representation
    which makes it faster than the SymPy Matrix class (currently) for many
    common operations, but this advantage makes it not entirely compatible
    with Matrix. DomainMatrix are analogous to numpy arrays with "dtype".
    In the DomainMatrix, each element has a domain such as :ref:`ZZ`
    or  :ref:`QQ(a)`.


    Examples
    ========

    Creating a DomainMatrix from the existing Matrix class:

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
    >>> Matrix1 = Matrix([
    ...    [1, 2],
    ...    [3, 4]])
    >>> A = DomainMatrix.from_Matrix(Matrix1)
    >>> A
    DomainMatrix({0: {0: 1, 1: 2}, 1: {0: 3, 1: 4}}, (2, 2), ZZ)

    Directly forming a DomainMatrix:

    >>> from sympy import ZZ
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
    >>> A = DomainMatrix([
    ...    [ZZ(1), ZZ(2)],
    ...    [ZZ(3), ZZ(4)]], (2, 2), ZZ)
    >>> A
    DomainMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]], (2, 2), ZZ)

        Parameters
        ==========

        rep: SDM or DDM
            The internal sparse or dense representation of the matrix.

        Returns

        DomainMatrix
            A :py:class:`~.DomainMatrix` wrapping *rep*.

        Notes
        =====

        This takes ownership of rep as its internal representation. If rep is
        being mutated elsewhere then a copy should be provided to
        ``from_rep``. Only minimal verification or checking is done on *rep*
        as this is supposed to be an efficient internal routine.
