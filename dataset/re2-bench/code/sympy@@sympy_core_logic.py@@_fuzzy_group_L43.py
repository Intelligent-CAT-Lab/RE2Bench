def _fuzzy_group(args, quick_exit=False):
    """Return True if all args are True, None if there is any None else False
    unless ``quick_exit`` is True (then return None as soon as a second False
    is seen.

     ``_fuzzy_group`` is like ``fuzzy_and`` except that it is more
    conservative in returning a False, waiting to make sure that all
    arguments are True or False and returning None if any arguments are
    None. It also has the capability of permiting only a single False and
    returning None if more than one is seen. For example, the presence of a
    single transcendental amongst rationals would indicate that the group is
    no longer rational; but a second transcendental in the group would make the
    determination impossible.


    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.core.logic import _fuzzy_group

    By default, multiple Falses mean the group is broken:

    >>> _fuzzy_group([False, False, True])
    False

    If multiple Falses mean the group status is unknown then set
    `quick_exit` to True so None can be returned when the 2nd False is seen:

    >>> _fuzzy_group([False, False, True], quick_exit=True)

    But if only a single False is seen then the group is known to
    be broken:

    >>> _fuzzy_group([False, True, True], quick_exit=True)
    False
