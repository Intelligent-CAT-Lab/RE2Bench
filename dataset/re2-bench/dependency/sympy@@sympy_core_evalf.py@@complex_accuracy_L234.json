This is an\n    approximation for two reasons: 1) it gives the ceil(log2(abs(x)))\n    value and 2) it is too high by 1 in the case that x is an exact\n    power of 2. Although this is easy to remedy by testing to see if\n    the odd mpf mantissa is 1 (indicating that one was dealing with\n    an exact power of 2) that would decrease the speed and is not\n    necessary as this is only being used as an approximation for the\n    number of bits in x. The correct return value could be written as\n    \"x[2] + (x[3] if x[1] != 1 else 0)\".\n        Since mpf tuples always have an odd mantissa, no check is done\n    to see if the mantissa is a multiple of 2 (in which case the\n    result would be too large by 1).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import log\n    >>> from sympy.core.evalf import fastlog\n    >>> s, m, e = 0, 5, 1\n    >>> bc = m.bit_length()\n    >>> n = [1, -1][s]*m*2**e\n    >>> n, (log(n)/log(2)).evalf(2), fastlog((s, m, e, bc))\n    (10, 3.3, 4)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not x or x == fzero:\n        return MINUS_INF\n    return x[2] + x[3]"
