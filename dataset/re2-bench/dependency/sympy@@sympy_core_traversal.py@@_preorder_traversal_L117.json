    "sympy.sympy.core.sorting.ordered": "def ordered(seq, keys=None, default=True, warn=False):\n    \"\"\"Return an iterator of the seq where keys are used to break ties\n    in a conservative fashion: if, after applying a key, there are no\n    ties then no other keys will be computed.\n\n    Two default keys will be applied if 1) keys are not provided or\n    2) the given keys do not resolve all ties (but only if ``default``\n    is True). The two keys are ``_nodes`` (which places smaller\n    expressions before large) and ``default_sort_key`` which (if the\n    ``sort_key`` for an object is defined properly) should resolve\n    any ties. This strategy is similar to sorting done by\n    ``Basic.compare``, but differs in that ``ordered`` never makes a\n    decision based on an objects name.\n\n    If ``warn`` is True then an error will be raised if there were no\n    keys remaining to break ties.

If one wants to break ties for items that\n    have the same decorated value, a second key can be used. But if the\n    second key is expensive to compute then it is inefficient to decorate\n    all items with both keys: only those items having identical first key\n    values need to be decorated. This function applies keys successively\n    only when needed to break ties. By yielding an iterator, use of the\n    tie-breaker is delayed as long as possible.\n\n    This function is best used in cases when use of the first key is\n    expected to be a good hashing function; if there are no unique hashes\n    from application of a key, then that key should not have been used. The\n    exception, however, is that even if there are many collisions, if the\n    first group is small and one does not need to process all items in the\n    list then time will not be wasted sorting what one was not interested\n    in. For example, if one were looking for the minimum in a list and\n    there were several criteria used to define the sort order, then this\n    function would be good at returning that quickly if the first group\n    of candidates is small relative to the number of items being processed.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    d = defaultdict(list)\n    if keys:\n        if isinstance(keys, (list, tuple)):\n            keys = list(keys)\n            f = keys.pop(0)\n        else:\n            f = keys\n            keys = []\n        for a in seq:\n            d[f(a)].append(a)\n    else:\n        if not default:\n            raise ValueError('if default=False then keys must be provided')\n        d[None].extend(seq)\n\n    for k, value in sorted(d.items()):\n        if len(value) > 1:\n            if keys:\n                value = ordered(value, keys, default, warn)\n            elif default:\n                value = ordered(value, (_nodes, default_sort_key,),\n                               default=False, warn=warn)\n            elif warn:\n                u = list(uniq(value))\n                if len(u) > 1:\n                    raise ValueError(\n                        'not enough keys to break ties: %s' % u)\n        yield from value",
