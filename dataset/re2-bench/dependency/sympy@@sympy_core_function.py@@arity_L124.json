If ``binary`` is True then a tuple\n    with lists ``T`` and ``F`` are returned where ``T`` is a list\n    containing elements of seq for which ``keyfunc`` was ``True`` and\n    ``F`` containing those elements for which ``keyfunc`` was ``False``;\n    a ValueError is raised if the ``keyfunc`` is not binary.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.utilities import sift\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sqrt, exp, pi, Tuple\n\n    >>> sift(range(5), lambda x: x % 2)\n    {0: [0, 2, 4], 1: [1, 3]}\n\n    sift() returns a defaultdict() object, so any key that has no matches will\n    give [].\n\n    >>> sift([x], lambda x: x.is_commutative)\n    {True: [x]}\n    >>> _[False]\n    []\n\n    Sometimes you will not know how many keys you will get:\n\n    >>> sift([sqrt(x), exp(x), (y**x)**2],\n    ...      lambda x: x.as_base_exp()[0])\n    {E: [exp(x)], x: [sqrt(x)], y: [y**(2*x)]}\n\n    Sometimes you expect the results to be binary; the\n    results can be unpacked by setting ``binary`` to True:\n\n    >>> sift(range(4), lambda x: x % 2, binary=True)\n    ([1, 3], [0, 2])\n    >>> sift(Tuple(1, pi), lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)\n    ([1], [pi])\n\n    A ValueError is raised if the predicate was not actually binary\n    (which is a good test for the logic where sifting is used and\n    binary results were expected):\n\n    >>> unknown = exp(1) - pi  # the rationality of this is unknown\n    >>> args = Tuple(1, pi, unknown)\n    >>> sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    ValueError: keyfunc gave non-binary output\n\n    The non-binary sifting shows that there were 3 keys generated:\n\n    >>> set(sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational).keys())\n    {None, False, True}\n\n    If you need to sort the sifted items it might be better to use\n    ``ordered`` which can economically apply multiple sort keys\n    to a sequence while sorting.\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    ordered\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if not binary:\n        m = defaultdict(list)\n        for i in seq:\n            m[keyfunc(i)].append(i)\n        return m\n    sift = F, T = [], []\n    for i in seq:\n        try:\n            sift[keyfunc(i)].append(i)\n        except (IndexError, TypeError):\n            raise ValueError('keyfunc gave non-binary output')\n    return T, F"
