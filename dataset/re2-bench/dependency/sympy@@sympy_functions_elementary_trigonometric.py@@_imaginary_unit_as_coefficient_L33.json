    "sympy.sympy.core.expr.as_coefficient": "def as_coefficient(self, expr: Expr) -> Expr | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts symbolic coefficient at the given expression. In\n    other words, this functions separates 'self' into the product\n    of 'expr' and 'expr'-free coefficient. If such separation\n    is not possible it will return None.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import E, pi, sin, I, Poly\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n\n    >>> E.as_coefficient(E)\n    1\n    >>> (2*E).as_coefficient(E)\n    2\n    >>> (2*sin(E)*E).as_coefficient(E)\n\n    Two terms have E in them so a sum is returned. (If one were\n    desiring the coefficient of the term exactly matching E then\n    the constant from the returned expression could be selected.\n    Or, for greater precision, a method of Poly can be used to\n    indicate the desired term from which the coefficient is\n    desired.)\n\n    >>> (2*E + x*E).as_coefficient(E)\n    x + 2\n    >>> _.args[0]  # just want the exact match\n    2\n    >>> p = Poly(2*E + x*E); p\n    Poly(x*E + 2*E, x, E, domain='ZZ')\n    >>> p.coeff_monomial(E)\n    2\n    >>> p.nth(0, 1)\n    2\n\n    Since the following cannot be written as a product containing\n    E as a factor, None is returned. (If the coefficient ``2*x`` is\n    desired then the ``coeff`` method should be used.)\n\n    >>> (2*E*x + x).as_coefficient(E)\n    >>> (2*E*x + x).coeff(E)\n    2*x\n\n    >>> (E*(x + 1) + x).as_coefficient(E)\n\n    >>> (2*pi*I).as_coefficient(pi*I)\n    2\n    >>> (2*I).as_coefficient(pi*I)\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    coeff: return sum of terms have a given factor\n    as_coeff_Add: separate the additive constant from an expression\n    as_coeff_Mul: separate the multiplicative constant from an expression\n    as_independent: separate x-dependent terms/factors from others\n    sympy.polys.polytools.Poly.coeff_monomial: efficiently find the single coefficient of a monomial in Poly\n    sympy.polys.polytools.Poly.nth: like coeff_monomial but powers of monomial terms are used\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    r = self.extract_multiplicatively(expr)\n    if r and not r.has(expr):\n        return r\n    else:\n        return None"
