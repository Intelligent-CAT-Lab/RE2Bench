If the expression itself does not match the query, then\n    the returned value will be ``self.xreplace(map)`` otherwise it should\n    be ``self.subs(ordered(map.items()))``.\n\n    Traverses an expression tree and performs replacement of matching\n    subexpressions from the bottom to the top of the tree. The default\n    approach is to do the replacement in a simultaneous fashion so\n    changes made are targeted only once. If this is not desired or causes\n    problems, ``simultaneous`` can be set to False.\n\n    In addition, if an expression containing more than one Wild symbol\n    is being used to match subexpressions and the ``exact`` flag is None\n    it will be set to True so the match will only succeed if all non-zero\n    values are received for each Wild that appears in the match pattern.\n    Setting this to False accepts a match of 0; while setting it True\n    accepts all matches that have a 0 in them. See example below for\n    cautions.\n\n    The list of possible combinations of queries and replacement values\n    is listed below:\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    Initial setup\n\n    >>> from sympy import log, sin, cos, tan, Wild, Mul, Add\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> f = log(sin(x)) + tan(sin(x**2))\n\n    1.1. type -> type\n        obj.replace(type, newtype)\n\n        When object of type ``type`` is found, replace it with the\n        result of passing its argument(s) to ``newtype``.\n\n        >>> f.replace(sin, cos)\n        log(cos(x)) + tan(cos(x**2))\n        >>> sin(x).replace(sin, cos, map=True)\n        (cos(x), {sin(x): cos(x)})\n        >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, Add)\n        x + y\n\n    1.2. type -> func\n        obj.replace(type, func)\n\n        When object of type ``type`` is found, apply ``func`` to its\n        argument(s). ``func`` must be written to handle the number\n        of arguments of ``type``.\n\n        >>> f.replace(sin, lambda arg: sin(2*arg))\n        log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))\n        >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, lambda *args: sin(2*Mul(*args)))\n        sin(2*x*y)\n\n    2.1. pattern -> expr\n        obj.replace(pattern(wild), expr(wild))\n\n        Replace subexpressions matching ``pattern`` with the expression\n        written in terms of the Wild symbols in ``pattern``.\n\n        >>> a, b = map(Wild, 'ab')\n        >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a))\n        log(tan(x)) + tan(tan(x**2))\n        >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a/2))\n        log(tan(x/2)) + tan(tan(x**2/2))\n        >>> f.replace(sin(a), a)\n        log(x) + tan(x**2)\n        >>> (x*y).replace(a*x, a)\n        y\n\n        Matching is exact by default when more than one Wild symbol\n        is used: matching fails unless the match gives non-zero\n        values for all Wild symbols:\n\n        >>> (2*x + y).replace(a*x + b, b - a)\n        y - 2\n        >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a)\n        2*x\n\n        When set to False, the results may be non-intuitive:\n\n        >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a, exact=False)\n        2/x\n\n    2.2. pattern -> func\n        obj.replace(pattern(wild), lambda wild: expr(wild))\n\n        All behavior is the same as in 2.1 but now a function in terms of\n        pattern variables is used rather than an expression:\n\n        >>> f.replace(sin(a), lambda a: sin(2*a))\n        log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))\n\n    3.1. func -> func\n        obj.replace(filter, func)\n\n        Replace subexpression ``e`` with ``func(e)`` if ``filter(e)``\n        is True.\n\n        >>> g = 2*sin(x**3)\n        >>> g.replace(lambda expr: expr.is_Number, lambda expr: expr**2)\n        4*sin(x**9)\n\n    The expression itself is also targeted by the query but is done in\n    such a fashion that changes are not made twice.\n\n        >>> e = x*(x*y + 1)\n        >>> e.replace(lambda x: x.is_Mul, lambda x: 2*x)\n        2*x*(2*x*y + 1)\n\n    When matching a single symbol, `exact` will default to True, but\n    this may or may not be the behavior that is desired:\n\n    Here, we want `exact=False`:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Function\n    >>> f = Function('f')\n    >>> e = f(1) + f(0)\n    >>> q = f(a), lambda a: f(a + 1)\n    >>> e.replace(*q, exact=False)\n    f(1) + f(2)\n    >>> e.replace(*q, exact=True)\n    f(0) + f(2)\n\n    But here, the nature of matching makes selecting\n    the right setting tricky:\n\n    >>> e = x**(1 + y)\n    >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)\n    x\n    >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)\n    x**(-x - y + 1)\n    >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)\n    x\n    >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)\n    x**(1 - y)\n\n    It is probably better to use a different form of the query\n    that describes the target expression more precisely:\n\n    >>> (1 + x**(1 + y)).replace(\n    ... lambda x: x.is_Pow and x.exp.is_Add and x.exp.args[0] == 1,\n    ... lambda x: x.base**(1 - (x.exp - 1)))\n    ...\n    x**(1 - y) + 1\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    subs: substitution of subexpressions as defined by the objects\n          themselves.\n    xreplace: exact node replacement in expr tree;

In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the :class:`~.Order` object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be defined in a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec('bitcount = lambda n: int(n).bit_length()', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: ``_clash1`` (single-letter variables),\n    ``_clash2`` (the multi-letter Greek names) or ``_clash`` (both single and\n    multi-letter names that are defined in ``abc``).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> set(_clash1)  # if this fails, see issue #23903\n    {'E', 'I', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'S'}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted.

See\n       :ref:`deprecated-sympify-string-fallback`.\n\n    Evaluation\n    ----------\n\n    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use.
