If\n    there are free symbols it is possible that the expression is a\n    constant, perhaps (but not necessarily) zero. To test such\n    expressions, a few strategies are tried:\n\n    1) numerical evaluation at two random points. If two such evaluations\n    give two different values and the values have a precision greater than\n    1 then self is not constant. If the evaluations agree or could not be\n    obtained with any precision, no decision is made. The numerical testing\n    is done only if ``wrt`` is different than the free symbols.\n\n    2) differentiation with respect to variables in 'wrt' (or all free\n    symbols if omitted) to see if the expression is constant or not. This\n    will not always lead to an expression that is zero even though an\n    expression is constant (see added test in test_expr.py). If\n    all derivatives are zero then self is constant with respect to the\n    given symbols.\n\n    3) finding out zeros of denominator expression with free_symbols.\n    It will not be constant if there are zeros. It gives more negative\n    answers for expression that are not constant.\n\n    If neither evaluation nor differentiation can prove the expression is\n    constant, None is returned unless two numerical values happened to be\n    the same and the flag ``failing_number`` is True -- in that case the\n    numerical value will be returned.\n\n    If flag simplify=False is passed, self will not be simplified;\n    the default is True since self should be simplified before testing.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import cos, sin, Sum, S, pi\n    >>> from sympy.abc import a, n, x, y\n    >>> x.is_constant()\n    False\n    >>> S(2).is_constant()\n    True\n    >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, 10)).is_constant()\n    True\n    >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant()\n    False\n    >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(y)\n    True\n    >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(n)\n    False\n    >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(x)\n    True\n    >>> eq = a*cos(x)**2 + a*sin(x)**2 - a\n    >>> eq.is_constant()\n    True\n    >>> eq.subs({x: pi, a: 2}) == eq.subs({x: pi, a: 3}) == 0\n    True\n\n    >>> (0**x).is_constant()\n    False\n    >>> x.is_constant()\n    False\n    >>> (x**x).is_constant()\n    False\n    >>> one = cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2\n    >>> one.is_constant()\n    True\n    >>> ((one - 1)**(x + 1)).is_constant() in (True, False) # could be 0 or 1\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n\n    simplify = flags.get('simplify', True)\n\n    if self.is_number:\n        return True\n    free = self.free_symbols\n    if not free:\n        return True  # assume f(1) is some constant\n\n    # if we are only interested in some symbols and they are not in the\n    # free symbols then this expression is constant wrt those symbols\n    wrt = set(wrt)\n    if wrt and not wrt & free:\n        return True\n    wrt = wrt or free\n\n    # simplify unless this has already been done\n    expr = self\n    if simplify:\n        expr = expr.simplify()\n\n    # is_zero should be a quick assumptions check; it can be wrong for\n    # numbers (see test_is_not_constant test), giving False when it\n    # shouldn't, but hopefully it will never give True unless it is sure.\n    if expr.is_zero:\n        return True\n\n    # Don't attempt substitution or differentiation with non-number symbols\n    wrt_number = {sym for sym in wrt if sym.kind is NumberKind}\n\n    # try numerical evaluation to see if we get two different values\n    failing_number = None\n    if wrt_number == free:\n        # try 0 (for a) and 1 (for b)\n        try:\n            a = expr.subs(list(zip(free, [0]*len(free))),\n                simultaneous=True)\n            if a is S.NaN:\n                # evaluation may succeed when substitution fails\n                a = expr._random(None, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            a = None\n        if a is not None and a is not S.NaN:\n            try:\n                b = expr.subs(list(zip(free, [1]*len(free))),\n                    simultaneous=True)\n                if b is S.NaN:\n                    # evaluation may succeed when substitution fails\n                    b = expr._random(None, 1, 0, 1, 0)\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                b = None\n            if b is not None and b is not S.NaN and b.equals(a) is False:\n                return False\n            # try random real\n            b = expr._random(None, -1, 0, 1, 0)\n            if b is not None and b is not S.NaN and b.equals(a) is False:\n                return False\n            # try random complex\n            b = expr._random()\n            if b is not None and b is not S.NaN:\n                if b.equals(a) is False:\n                    return False\n                failing_number = a if a.is_number else b\n\n    # now we will test each wrt symbol (or all free symbols) to see if the\n    # expression depends on them or not using differentiation.

This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered.
