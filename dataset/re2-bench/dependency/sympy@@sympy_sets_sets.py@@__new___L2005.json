If one wants to break ties for items that\n    have the same decorated value, a second key can be used.

This function applies keys successively\n    only when needed to break ties. By yielding an iterator, use of the\n    tie-breaker is delayed as long as possible.\n\n    This function is best used in cases when use of the first key is\n    expected to be a good hashing function; if there are no unique hashes\n    from application of a key, then that key should not have been used. The\n    exception, however, is that even if there are many collisions, if the\n    first group is small and one does not need to process all items in the\n    list then time will not be wasted sorting what one was not interested\n    in. For example, if one were looking for the minimum in a list and\n    there were several criteria used to define the sort order, then this\n    function would be good at returning that quickly if the first group\n    of candidates is small relative to the number of items being processed.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    d = defaultdict(list)\n    if keys:\n        if isinstance(keys, (list, tuple)):\n            keys = list(keys)\n            f = keys.pop(0)\n        else:\n            f = keys\n            keys = []\n        for a in seq:\n            d[f(a)].append(a)\n    else:\n        if not default:\n            raise ValueError('if default=False then keys must be provided')\n        d[None].extend(seq)\n\n    for k, value in sorted(d.items()):\n        if len(value) > 1:\n            if keys:\n                value = ordered(value, keys, default, warn)\n            elif default:\n                value = ordered(value, (_nodes, default_sort_key,),\n                               default=False, warn=warn)\n            elif warn:\n                u = list(uniq(value))\n                if len(u) > 1:\n                    raise ValueError(\n                        'not enough keys to break ties: %s' % u)\n        yield from value",

This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered.
