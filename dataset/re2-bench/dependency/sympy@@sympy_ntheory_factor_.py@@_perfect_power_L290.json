For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import factorint\n    >>> factorint(2000)    # 2000 = (2**4) * (5**3)\n    {2: 4, 5: 3}\n    >>> factorint(65537)   # This number is prime\n    {65537: 1}\n\n    For input less than 2, factorint behaves as follows:\n\n        - ``factorint(1)`` returns the empty factorization, ``{}``\n        - ``factorint(0)`` returns ``{0:1}``\n        - ``factorint(-n)`` adds ``-1:1`` to the factors and then factors ``n``\n\n    Partial Factorization:\n\n    If ``limit`` (> 3) is specified, the search is stopped after performing\n    trial division up to (and including) the limit (or taking a\n    corresponding number of rho/p-1 steps). This is useful if one has\n    a large number and only is interested in finding small factors (if\n    any). Note that setting a limit does not prevent larger factors\n    from being found early; it simply means that the largest factor may\n    be composite. Since checking for perfect power is relatively cheap, it is\n    done regardless of the limit setting.\n\n    This number, for example, has two small factors and a huge\n    semi-prime factor that cannot be reduced easily:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime\n    >>> a = 1407633717262338957430697921446883\n    >>> f = factorint(a, limit=10000)\n    >>> f == {991: 1, int(202916782076162456022877024859): 1, 7: 1}\n    True\n    >>> isprime(max(f))\n    False\n\n    This number has a small factor and a residual perfect power whose\n    base is greater than the limit:\n\n    >>> factorint(3*101**7, limit=5)\n    {3: 1, 101: 7}\n\n    List of Factors:\n\n    If ``multiple`` is set to ``True`` then a list containing the\n    prime factors including multiplicities is returned.\n\n    >>> factorint(24, multiple=True)\n    [2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    Visual Factorization:\n\n    If ``visual`` is set to ``True``, then it will return a visual\n    factorization of the integer.  For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import pprint\n    >>> pprint(factorint(4200, visual=True))\n     3  1  2  1\n    2 *3 *5 *7\n\n    Note that this is achieved by using the evaluate=False flag in Mul\n    and Pow. If you do other manipulations with an expression where\n    evaluate=False, it may evaluate.  Therefore, you should use the\n    visual option only for visualization, and use the normal dictionary\n    returned by visual=False if you want to perform operations on the\n    factors.\n\n    You can easily switch between the two forms by sending them back to\n    factorint:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Mul\n    >>> regular = factorint(1764); regular\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n    >>> pprint(factorint(regular))\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n\n    >>> visual = factorint(1764, visual=True); pprint(visual)\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n    >>> print(factorint(visual))\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n\n    If you want to send a number to be factored in a partially factored form\n    you can do so with a dictionary or unevaluated expression:\n\n    >>> factorint(factorint({4: 2, 12: 3})) # twice to toggle to dict form\n    {2: 10, 3: 3}\n    >>> factorint(Mul(4, 12, evaluate=False))\n    {2: 4, 3: 1}\n\n    The table of the output logic is:\n\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n                       Visual\n        ------ ----------------------\n        Input  True   False   other\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n        dict    mul    dict    mul\n        n       mul    dict    dict\n        mul     mul    dict    dict\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    The function switches between multiple algorithms. Trial division\n    quickly finds small factors (of the order 1-5 digits), and finds\n    all large factors if given enough time. The Pollard rho and p-1\n    algorithms are used to find large factors ahead of time; they\n    will often find factors of the order of 10 digits within a few\n    seconds:\n\n    >>> factors = factorint(12345678910111213141516)\n    >>> for base, exp in sorted(factors.items()):\n    ...     print('%s %s' % (base, exp))\n    ...\n    2 2\n    2507191691 1\n    1231026625769 1\n\n    Any of these methods can optionally be disabled with the following\n    boolean parameters:\n\n        -

For n < 2^64 the\n    answer is definitive; larger n values have a small probability of actually\n    being pseudoprimes.\n\n    Negative numbers (e.g. -2) are not considered prime.\n\n    The first step is looking for trivial factors, which if found enables\n    a quick return.  Next, if the sieve is large enough, use bisection search\n    on the sieve.  For small numbers, a set of deterministic Miller-Rabin\n    tests are performed with bases that are known to have no counterexamples\n    in their range.  Finally if the number is larger than 2^64, a strong\n    BPSW test is performed.  While this is a probable prime test and we\n    believe counterexamples exist, there are no known counterexamples.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime\n    >>> isprime(13)\n    True\n    >>> isprime(15)\n    False\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    This routine is intended only for integer input, not numerical\n    expressions which may represent numbers. Floats are also\n    rejected as input because they represent numbers of limited\n    precision. While it is tempting to permit 7.0 to represent an\n    integer there are errors that may \"pass silently\" if this is\n    allowed:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Float, S\n    >>> int(1e3) == 1e3 == 10**3\n    True\n    >>> int(1e23) == 1e23\n    True\n    >>> int(1e23) == 10**23\n    False\n\n    >>> near_int = 1 + S(1)/10**19\n    >>> near_int == int(near_int)\n    False\n    >>> n = Float(near_int, 10)  # truncated by precision\n    >>> n % 1 == 0\n    True\n    >>> n = Float(near_int, 20)\n    >>> n % 1 == 0\n    False\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    sympy.ntheory.generate.primerange : Generates all primes in a given range\n    sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers.primepi : Return the number of primes less than or equal to n\n    sympy.ntheory.generate.prime : Return the nth prime\n\n    References\n    ==========\n    ..
