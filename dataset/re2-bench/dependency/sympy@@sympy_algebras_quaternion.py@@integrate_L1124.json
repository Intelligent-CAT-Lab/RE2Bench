Use\n       :meth:`.Poly.integrate` instead. See :ref:`deprecated-integrate-poly`.\n\n    Explanation\n    ===========\n\n    Compute definite or indefinite integral of one or more variables\n    using Risch-Norman algorithm and table lookup. This procedure is\n    able to handle elementary algebraic and transcendental functions\n    and also a huge class of special functions, including Airy,\n    Bessel, Whittaker and Lambert.\n\n    var can be:\n\n    - a symbol                   -- indefinite integration\n    - a tuple (symbol, a)        -- indefinite integration with result\n                                    given with ``a`` replacing ``symbol``\n    - a tuple (symbol, a, b)     -- definite integration\n\n    Several variables can be specified, in which case the result is\n    multiple integration. (If var is omitted and the integrand is\n    univariate, the indefinite integral in that variable will be performed.)\n\n    Indefinite integrals are returned without terms that are independent\n    of the integration variables. (see examples)\n\n    Definite improper integrals often entail delicate convergence\n    conditions. Pass conds='piecewise', 'separate' or 'none' to have\n    these returned, respectively, as a Piecewise function, as a separate\n    result (i.e. result will be a tuple), or not at all (default is\n    'piecewise').\n\n    **Strategy**\n\n    SymPy uses various approaches to definite integration. One method is to\n    find an antiderivative for the integrand, and then use the fundamental\n    theorem of calculus. Various functions are implemented to integrate\n    polynomial, rational and trigonometric functions, and integrands\n    containing DiracDelta terms.\n\n    SymPy also implements the part of the Risch algorithm, which is a decision\n    procedure for integrating elementary functions, i.e., the algorithm can\n    either find an elementary antiderivative, or prove that one does not\n    exist.  There is also a (very successful, albeit somewhat slow) general\n    implementation of the heuristic Risch algorithm.  This algorithm will\n    eventually be phased out as more of the full Risch algorithm is\n    implemented. See the docstring of Integral._eval_integral() for more\n    details on computing the antiderivative using algebraic methods.\n\n    The option risch=True can be used to use only the (full) Risch algorithm.\n    This is useful if you want to know if an elementary function has an\n    elementary antiderivative.  If the indefinite Integral returned by this\n    function is an instance of NonElementaryIntegral, that means that the\n    Risch algorithm has proven that integral to be non-elementary.  Note that\n    by default, additional methods (such as the Meijer G method outlined\n    below) are tried on these integrals, as they may be expressible in terms\n    of special functions, so if you only care about elementary answers, use\n    risch=True.  Also note that an unevaluated Integral returned by this\n    function is not necessarily a NonElementaryIntegral, even with risch=True,\n    as it may just be an indication that the particular part of the Risch\n    algorithm needed to integrate that function is not yet implemented.\n\n    Another family of strategies comes from re-writing the integrand in\n    terms of so-called Meijer G-functions. Indefinite integrals of a\n    single G-function can always be computed, and the definite integral\n    of a product of two G-functions can be computed from zero to\n    infinity. Various strategies are implemented to rewrite integrands\n    as G-functions, and use this information to compute integrals (see\n    the ``meijerint`` module).\n\n    The option manual=True can be used to use only an algorithm that tries\n    to mimic integration by hand. This algorithm does not handle as many\n    integrands as the other algorithms implemented but may return results in\n    a more familiar form. The ``manualintegrate`` module has functions that\n    return the steps used (see the module docstring for more information).\n\n    In general, the algebraic methods work best for computing\n    antiderivatives of (possibly complicated) combinations of elementary\n    functions. The G-function methods work best for computing definite\n    integrals from zero to infinity of moderately complicated\n    combinations of special functions, or indefinite integrals of very\n    simple combinations of special functions.\n\n    The strategy employed by the integration code is as follows:\n\n    - If computing a definite integral, and both limits are real,\n      and at least one limit is +- oo, try the G-function method of\n      definite integration first.\n\n    - Try to find an antiderivative, using all available methods, ordered\n      by performance (that is try fastest method first, slowest last; in\n      particular polynomial integration is tried first, Meijer\n      G-functions second to last, and heuristic Risch last).\n\n    - If still not successful, try G-functions irrespective of the\n      limits.\n\n    The option meijerg=True, False, None can be used to, respectively:\n    always use G-function methods and no others, never use G-function\n    methods, or use all available methods (in order as described above).\n    It defaults to None.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import integrate, log, exp, oo\n    >>> from sympy.abc import a, x, y\n\n    >>> integrate(x*y, x)\n    x**2*y/2\n\n    >>> integrate(log(x), x)\n    x*log(x) - x\n\n    >>> integrate(log(x), (x, 1, a))\n    a*log(a) - a + 1\n\n    >>> integrate(x)\n    x**2/2\n\n    Terms that are independent of x are dropped by indefinite integration:\n\n    >>> from sympy import sqrt\n    >>> integrate(sqrt(1 + x), (x, 0, x))\n    2*(x + 1)**(3/2)/3 - 2/3\n    >>> integrate(sqrt(1 + x), x)\n    2*(x + 1)**(3/2)/3\n\n    >>> integrate(x*y)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    ValueError: specify integration variables to integrate x*y\n\n    Note that ``integrate(x)`` syntax is meant only for convenience\n    in interactive sessions and should be avoided in library code.\n\n    >>> integrate(x**a*exp(-x), (x, 0, oo)) # same as conds='piecewise'\n    Piecewise((gamma(a + 1), re(a) > -1),\n        (Integral(x**a*exp(-x), (x, 0, oo)), True))\n\n    >>> integrate(x**a*exp(-x), (x, 0, oo), conds='none')\n    gamma(a + 1)\n\n    >>> integrate(x**a*exp(-x), (x, 0, oo), conds='separate')\n    (gamma(a + 1), re(a) > -1)\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    Integral, Integral.doit\n\n    \"\"\"\n    doit_flags = {\n        'deep': False,\n        'meijerg': meijerg,\n        'conds': conds,\n        'risch': risch,\n        'heurisch': heurisch,\n        'manual': manual\n        }\n\n    integral = Integral(function, *symbols, **kwargs)\n\n    if isinstance(integral, Integral):\n        return integral.doit(**doit_flags)\n    else:\n        new_args = [a.doit(**doit_flags) if isinstance(a, Integral) else a\n            for a in integral.args]\n        return integral.func(*new_args)"
