[THOUGHT]
The function radsimp is called with expr = 1/(a - b), symbolic = False, and max_terms = 1. Since symbolic is False and the denominator (a - b) contains free symbols, the handle function returns the expression unchanged early in its execution. Therefore, radsimp returns the original expression 1/(a - b) without modification.
