[THOUGHT]
The function `_mask_nc` is designed to handle non-commutative expressions by masking them with dummy variables. Given the input `eq` as the string `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"` and `name` as `null` (which defaults to `'mask'`), I need to simulate its execution.

First, `name` is set to `'mask'` because `name` is `null`. However, the key step is checking if the expression `expr` (which is `eq`) is commutative. In SymPy, the expression `2 - 2*cos(phi)` consists of commutative elements: numbers (2) are commutative, the cosine function `cos(phi)` is commutative, and the symbol `phi` (if not specified otherwise) is commutative. Therefore, `expr.is_commutative` evaluates to `True`.

Since `expr.is_commutative` is `True`, the function immediately returns `(eq, {}, [])`. Here, `eq` is the original input expression, which remains unchanged. The second element is an empty dictionary `{}` because no substitutions are made, and the third element is an empty list `[]` because there are no non-commutative symbols to list.

Thus, the output is a tuple containing the expression string `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"`, an empty dictionary, and an empty list.
