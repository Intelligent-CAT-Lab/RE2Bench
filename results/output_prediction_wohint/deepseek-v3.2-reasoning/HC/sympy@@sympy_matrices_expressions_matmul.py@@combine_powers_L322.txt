[THOUGHT]
We are given the function combine_powers(mul). The input provides mul as the string "X*Z". However, the function expects mul to be a MatMul object with an as_coeff_matrices method. Since the input is a string, this is likely a shorthand for a MatMul of two matrix symbols X and Z. We assume X and Z are square matrix symbols, not equal, and not inverses. Then the function will proceed as follows:

1. factor, args = mul.as_coeff_matrices() -> factor = 1, args = [X, Z].
2. new_args = [X].
3. For i=1 (B=Z):
   - Check if B is Inverse with MatMul arg: false.
   - Check if A is Inverse with MatMul arg: false.
   - Check if A.is_square == False or B.is_square == False: Assume both are square (or unknown), so false.
   - A and B are not MatPow, so A_base = X, A_exp = 1; B_base = Z, B_exp = 1.
   - A_base != B_base.
   - isinstance(B_base, MatrixBase) is false (since Z is a matrix symbol). So try B_base.inverse() -> Inverse(Z). Then check if A_base == Inverse(Z): false.
   - So append B: new_args = [X, Z].
4. Return newmul(1, X, Z) -> MatMul(X, Z).

Thus, the output is the same as the input MatMul. Representing as a string, it is "X*Z".
