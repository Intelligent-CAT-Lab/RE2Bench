We need to simulate `_get_metadata_request` on the given `self` object. The `self` object has an attribute `_metadata_request` which is a string representation of a dictionary. The method first checks if `self` has `_metadata_request` (which it does), then calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)`. 

Looking at the provided `get_routing_for_object` function:
- It checks if the object has a `get_metadata_routing` method. The string does not.
- It checks if the object has a `_type` attribute equal to "metadata_request" or "metadata_router". The string does not have a `_type` attribute.
- Therefore, it returns `MetadataRequest(owner=None)`.

Thus, `_get_metadata_request` will return a new `MetadataRequest` instance with `owner=None`. According to the `__init__` of `MetadataRequest`, it sets each method in `SIMPLE_METHODS` to a `MethodMetadataRequest` with the same owner and method name. The list of methods (from the class `_MetadataRequester`) includes: fit, partial_fit, predict, predict_proba, predict_log_proba, decision_function, score, split, transform, inverse_transform.

The output should be a JSON representation of this object. We'll represent it as a dictionary with the owner and each method as a nested dictionary with owner and method keys.
