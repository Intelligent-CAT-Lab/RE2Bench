The given expression is `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`. Let's analyze step-by-step how `factor_terms` processes it:

1. **Input sympification**:  
   The string `"2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"` is sympified into the SymPy expression:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2}
   \]

2. **Structure of expression**:  
   This is a `Mul` of `2*x` and `1/(a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2)`. The denominator is an `Add`: `a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2`.

3. **Processing in `factor_terms`**:  
   - Since the expression is not an iterable, not a `Sum` or `Integral`, and has `args_cnc`, it goes to `cont, p = expr.as_content_primitive(...)`.
   - `as_content_primitive` extracts the rational content. Here, the content is `2` and the primitive part is `x/(a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2)`.
   - `p` is not an `Add` (it's a `Mul` of `x` and a `Pow`), so it goes to the `elif p.args:` branch, recursively calling `do` on each argument.

4. **Recursing into denominator**:  
   The `Pow` term `(a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2)^{-1}` has a base that is an `Add`. Inside `do` for this base:
   - `list_args` becomes `[a**2*x**2, -a**2*y**2]`.
   - The condition about extracting `-1` fails because not all terms have a factor of `-1`.
   - No special dummy replacements happen.
   - Then `p = gcd_terms(p, isprimitive=True, ...)`. `gcd_terms` factors common terms from the `Add`.  
     The common factor in `a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2` is `a^2`, giving `a^2*(x^2 - y^2)`.
   - So the base becomes `a^2*(x^2 - y^2)`, and the `Pow` becomes `(a^2*(x^2 - y^2))^{-1}`.

5. **Final multiplication**:  
   The primitive part `p` becomes `x * (a^2*(x^2 - y^2))^{-1} = x/(a^2*(x^2 - y^2))`.
   Multiplying by the content `2` gives:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{a^2(x^2 - y^2)}
   \]

6. **Output**:  
   The expression is returned, which in string form is `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`.

Thus, the output of `factor_terms` is the SymPy expression `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`.
