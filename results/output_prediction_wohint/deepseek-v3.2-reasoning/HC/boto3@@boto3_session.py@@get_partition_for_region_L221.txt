[THOUGHT]
The `get_partition_for_region` method simply delegates to `self._session.get_partition_for_region(region_name)`. In the provided input, `self._session` is represented as a mock object. Without specific mock behavior defined in the input, we must assume a reasonable default. Since the region "foo-bar-1" is non-standard and the method typically returns a partition string (like "aws"), we assume the mock returns "aws". Thus, the method returns the string "aws".
