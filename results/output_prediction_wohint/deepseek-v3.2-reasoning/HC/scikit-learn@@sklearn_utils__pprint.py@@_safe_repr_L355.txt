[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `_safe_repr` and input arguments: object is the string "dictionary", context is a dictionary with one key, maxlevels is None, level is 1, and changed_only is True.

The function first checks the type of the object. Since it's a string, which is a built-in scalar (part of `pprint._builtin_scalars`), it immediately returns `(repr(object), True, False)`. The `repr` of the string "dictionary" is `"'dictionary'"` (with quotes). Therefore, the function returns the tuple `("'dictionary'", True, False)`.

In JSON format, this tuple can be represented as a list with three elements: the string representation, and the two booleans. So the output is `["'dictionary'", true, false]`.
