1. The `resolve_backend` method is called with `backend = "agg"`.
2. First, it checks if backend is a string: yes, and it doesn't start with 'module://', so `backend` is converted to lowercase, but it's already lowercase ("agg").
3. It looks up `gui` in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK.get("agg")`. According to the dictionary provided, `'agg': 'headless'` is present, so `gui = 'headless'`.
4. Since `gui` is not `None`, the method proceeds to return `(backend, gui if gui != 'headless' else None)`.
5. Since `gui == 'headless'`, the second element of the tuple becomes `None`.
6. Therefore, the output is `("agg", None)`.
