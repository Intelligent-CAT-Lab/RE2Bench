[THOUGHT]
The input to `expand_log` is a string `"log(2)"` with `factor=False`. Inside the function, when `factor` is False, it attempts to replace certain multiplicative expressions using a helper function `_handleMul`. However, the expression `log(2)` is not a multiplication (`Mul`), so the condition in the `replace` method is not satisfied, and no replacement occurs. Subsequently, the function calls `sympify` on the expression, converting it to the SymPy object `log(2)`, and then expands it with `log=True`. Since `log(2)` is already in its simplest form, the expansion does not change it. Thus, the output remains `log(2)`.
