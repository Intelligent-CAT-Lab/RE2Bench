[THOUGHT]
We are given the `_BinMapper.fit` method and inputs. The method fits the estimator on a large dataset (1,000,000 samples, 2 features) with parameters: `n_bins=11`, `subsample=200,000`, `random_state=42`, and others `None`. The steps are:

1. Validate `n_bins` (11) is between 3 and 256.
2. Convert `X` to the required dtype via `check_array`. The input `X` is a string representation of a NumPy array; we assume it's a valid array of shape (1,000,000, 2) with float values.
3. `max_bins = n_bins - 1 = 10`.
4. Create a random state with seed 42.
5. Since `X.shape[0] = 1,000,000` > `subsample = 200,000`, take a random subsample of 200,000 rows without replacement using the random state.
6. Because `is_categorical` is `None`, set `is_categorical_` to an array of zeros for both features.
7. Validate `known_categories` (both `None`) against `is_categorical_` (all non-categorical) — no error.
8. Set `missing_values_bin_idx_ = n_bins - 1 = 10`.
9. Initialize `bin_thresholds_` and `n_bins_non_missing` as lists of `None` for 2 features.
10. Use `Parallel` to compute binning thresholds for non-categorical features (both features) via `_find_binning_thresholds`. This function (not provided) returns thresholds that split the data into at most `max_bins` bins (here, 10 bins → 9 thresholds). The exact thresholds depend on the subsampled data, which we don't have fully.
11. For each feature, store the thresholds in `bin_thresholds_` and compute `n_bins_non_missing` as `thresholds.shape[0] + 1`. Assuming the data is continuous and `_find_binning_thresholds` uses all `max_bins`, each feature gets 9 thresholds and 10 non-missing bins.
12. Set `n_bins_non_missing_` to an array of these counts (10 for each feature).
13. Return `self`.

Thus, the fitted estimator has attributes:
- `is_categorical_`: [0, 0]
- `missing_values_bin_idx_`: 10
- `bin_thresholds_`: list of two arrays, each with 9 threshold values (unknown exactly, but they'd be floats).
- `n_bins_non_missing_`: [10, 10]

Given the lack of exact data and `_find_binning_thresholds` implementation, we output a representative structure with placeholder thresholds (zeros). In practice, the thresholds would be computed from the subsampled data.
