[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method of the `Basic` class attempts to compare `self` with `other`. Since `self` is a `Basic` instance (implied by the context) and `other` is a string, their types differ. The method checks if either is a `Pow` with exponent 1, which is not the case. It then tries to sympify `other` using `_sympify`. The given string `"8*\"Derivative(f(x)\", x)"` (unescaped as `8*"Derivative(f(x)", x`) is not a valid SymPy expression due to the misplaced quotes, causing `sympify` to raise a `SympifyError`. This exception is caught, and the method returns `False`.
