[THOUGHT]
The method `add_attrs_init` of `_ClassBuilder` returns `self` after appending a tuple to `self._script_snippets`. The input provides only a partial state of the instance, specifically `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr`. Without the complete state (like `_cls`, `_attrs`, etc.), we cannot compute the exact content of the appended tuple. However, the method always returns `self`, so the output is the same instance. The input JSON does not include other attributes, so we assume the output should reflect the same structure. Since the method modifies the instance by adding to `_script_snippets`, the output should ideally include that field, but we cannot determine its value from the given input. Given the constraints, the output is the same as the input self.
