[THOUGHT]
The `_fit` method is called with `precomputed=True`, meaning the input `X` is already a boolean mask. Since `self._precomputed` is set to `True`, `X` is directly used as `imputer_mask`. With `features="missing-only"`, `n_missing` is computed by summing `True` values along each column, resulting in `[5, 5]` for both columns. Thus, `features_indices` becomes `[0, 1]`. The method returns `imputer_mask`, which is the original `X` unchanged. The output is the same boolean array provided in the input.
