Looking at the `__getitem__` method in the MatrixExpr class and the given input where `key = [1, 2]`:

[THOUGHT]
1. The method checks if `key` is a tuple with length 2: `isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2`
2. The provided key is `[1, 2]`, which is a list, not a tuple, so this condition fails
3. Next, it checks if `key` is an integer type: `isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer))` - `[1, 2]` is a list, not an integer
4. Then it checks if `key` is a Symbol or Expr: `isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr))` - a list is neither
5. Since none of the conditions match, it reaches the final line: `raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)`
6. The method raises an IndexError with the message "Invalid index, wanted <self>[i,j]" where `<self>` would be the string representation of the matrix object

[OUTPUT]
{
    "error": "IndexError",
    "message": "Invalid index, wanted <MatrixExpr object at 0x...>[i,j]"
}
