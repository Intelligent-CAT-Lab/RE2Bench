[THOUGHT]
The function `_osbornei(e, d)` expects two positional arguments: `e` (an expression) and `d` (a symbol). The input provided only includes `e` as a dictionary `{"nargs": {}}`, with no value for `d` in `args` or `kwargs`. Therefore, when attempting to call the function with only one argument, a TypeError will be raised due to the missing required argument `d`. Consequently, the function cannot execute successfully to produce a meaningful output expression.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "error": "TypeError: _osbornei() missing 1 required positional argument: 'd'"
}
