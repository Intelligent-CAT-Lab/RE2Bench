[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the confusion matrix for the given inputs. The inputs are provided as strings representing arrays. We first parse them into arrays of integers:

- `y_true`: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (length 20)
- `y_pred`: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (length 20)

Since `y_true` and `y_pred` are identical, the confusion matrix will be diagonal. The function will determine the labels automatically as the unique values from both arrays, which are [0, 1]. With no normalization and no sample weights, the confusion matrix counts the occurrences of each true-predicted pair.

Counting:
- True label 0 and predicted 0: occurs 9 times.
- True label 1 and predicted 1: occurs 11 times.
- There are no misclassifications.

Thus, the confusion matrix is a 2x2 array with rows corresponding to true labels (0, 1) and columns to predicted labels (0, 1):
- Row 0: [9, 0]
- Row 1: [0, 11]

The function returns this as a numpy array, which we represent in JSON as a list of lists.
