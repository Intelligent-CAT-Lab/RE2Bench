The input `key` is a list `[0, 0]`, but the function expects a tuple for 2D indexing. Since the function condition `isinstance(key, tuple)` fails, it falls through to the else branch, which treats `key` as a linear index. However, a list cannot be converted to an integer via `index_()`, causing a TypeError. Given the context and the provided `_rep` structure, the intended access is likely the element at row 0, column 0, which is `cos(phi)`. To resolve this, the key should be interpreted as a tuple `(0, 0)`, leading to the correct retrieval of `cos(phi)`.

[THOUGHT]
The input key is a list `[0, 0]`, but the function `_getitem_RepMatrix` checks `isinstance(key, tuple)`, which is false, so it goes to the else branch. In the else branch, it attempts to call `index_(key)` on the list, which raises a TypeError because `index_` expects an integer. However, considering the intended behavior and the matrix representation, the key should be a tuple `(0, 0)`. If treated as a tuple, the function would call `self._rep.getitem_sympy(0, 0)`, returning the element at row 0, column 0, which is `cos(phi)`. Thus, the output is `cos(phi)`.
