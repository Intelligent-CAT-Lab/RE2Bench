Looking at the code for `world_to_pixel_values`, I need to understand what happens when called with the given input. Let me trace through the execution step by step.

[THOUGHT]
The input shows `args` is empty `{}`, meaning no world arrays were passed to `world_to_pixel_values`. Looking at the method signature:

```python
def world_to_pixel_values(self, *world_arrays):
```

When called with no arguments, `world_arrays` will be an empty tuple. Let me trace the execution:

1. First line computes:
   ```python
   sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))
   ```

   From input: `self._pixel_keep` is `"[0 1]"` which appears to be a string representation of an array. Based on Python's string representation, this likely means `[0, 1]`. So `len(self._pixel_keep)` = 2.

   Therefore: `*[0] * 2` = `[0, 0]`, so we call `_pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`.

2. Inside `_pixel_to_world_values_all`:
   - `pixel_arrays` becomes `(np.asanyarray(0), np.asanyarray(0))` = `(0, 0)`
   - `self._wcs.pixel_n_dim` = 3 (from input: `self._wcs.naxis` = 3)
   - `self._slices_pixel` = null

   The loop iterates over `ipix in range(3)`:
   - When `ipix` = 0: `self._slices_pixel[0]` is null? Actually `self._slices_pixel` is `null` (None), so this would cause an error when trying to index `None[0]`.

   However, looking more carefully at the input structure, `self._slices_pixel` is `null` but should be a list of slices/integers. This suggests the object might not be properly initialized or the input is incomplete.

3. The key issue is that `_slices_pixel` is null, which means we can't properly execute the code. When we try to access `self._slices_pixel[ipix]` in the loop, we get `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`.

Therefore, the execution would fail with a TypeError.
[/THOUGHT]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "error": "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable",
  "details": "self._slices_pixel is null/None but code tries to index it as self._slices_pixel[ipix]"
}
```
