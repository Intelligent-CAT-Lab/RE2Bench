[THOUGHT]
We are given a pattern `sin(x*a_)**n_ * cos(x*a_)**m_` (a product of two powers) and an expression `cos(x)`. We need to determine if the pattern matches the expression using the `matches` method of the `Mul` class. The pattern contains three wild symbols: `a_`, `n_`, and `m_`. For the pattern to match `cos(x)`, one of the factors must become 1. This occurs if `n_ = 0` (making `sin(x*a_)**n_ = 1`) and `m_ = 1` with `a_ = 1` (making `cos(x*a_)**m_ = cos(x)`). The matching algorithm will find this substitution, resulting in a dictionary mapping the wild symbols to their matched values: `a_` to 1, `n_` to 0, and `m_` to 1. Thus, the function returns this dictionary.
