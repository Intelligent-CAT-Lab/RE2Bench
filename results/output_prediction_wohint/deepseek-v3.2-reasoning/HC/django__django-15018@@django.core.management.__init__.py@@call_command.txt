[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate `call_command("transaction", stdout={}, no_color=True)`. The function loads the command class for "transaction", creates a parser, processes arguments, and executes the command. The `transaction` command is a built-in Django command from `django.core.management.commands.transaction`. The `no_color` option is a base argument and will be passed to the command's `execute` method. The `stdout` option is a stealth option (allowed but not used in parsing). The command's `execute` method typically returns `None` after execution. The provided `stdout` dictionary is not used because the command instance is created without arguments, so `self.stdout` defaults to `sys.stdout`. The `no_color=True` option sets `self.style` to `no_style()` during execution. The function returns the result of `command.execute()`, which is `None` for the `transaction` command. Thus, the output is `null`.
