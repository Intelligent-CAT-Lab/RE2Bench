[THOUGHT]
We are given a `row_join` operation on two matrices. The first matrix `self` is represented as having 2 rows and 2 columns, with an internal representation `_rep` as a `DomainMatrix` equivalent to the 2x2 identity matrix. The second matrix `other` is given as a string `"Matrix([\n[1, 0],\n[0, 1]])"`, which is also a 2x2 identity matrix. The `row_join` method concatenates matrices horizontally. Since both matrices have 2 rows, the operation is valid. The result is a new matrix with 2 rows and 4 columns, where the first two columns come from `self` and the last two from `other`. The resulting `DomainMatrix` representation is computed by horizontally stacking the two `DomainMatrix` representations. The stacked representation has non-zero entries at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (1,3), each with value 1. Thus, the output matrix has rows=2, cols=4, and the `_rep` as described.
