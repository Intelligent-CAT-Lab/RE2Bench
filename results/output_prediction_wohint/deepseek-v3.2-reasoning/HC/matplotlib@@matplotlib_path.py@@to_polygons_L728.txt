Looking at the `to_polygons` method with the given input:

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1. **Check if vertices array is empty**: `len(self.vertices) == 0`
   - `self._vertices` is `array([[80., 330.], [576., 330.]])` → length is 2
   - Condition is false, proceed

2. **Transform handling**: `transform` is `null` (None in Python)
   - `if transform is not None:` condition is false
   - No frozen transform created

3. **Main condition**: `if self.codes is None and (width == 0 or height == 0):`
   - `self.codes` is `null` (None in Python) → True
   - `width` is 0 → `(width == 0 or height == 0)` is True
   - Enter this branch

4. **Inside the branch**:
   - `vertices = self.vertices` → gets the 2×2 array
   - `closed_only` is `false` → skip the closed polygon logic
   - `if transform is None:` is True → return `[vertices]`

5. **Return value**:
   - Returns `[array([[80., 330.], [576., 330.]])]`
   - This is a list containing one polygon (the vertices array)

[THOUGHT]
The function returns a list containing the vertices array since codes is None, width=0, height=0, transform=None, and closed_only=false. The output is a list with one element: the 2×2 vertices array.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "polygons": [[[80.0, 330.0], [576.0, 330.0]]]
}
```
