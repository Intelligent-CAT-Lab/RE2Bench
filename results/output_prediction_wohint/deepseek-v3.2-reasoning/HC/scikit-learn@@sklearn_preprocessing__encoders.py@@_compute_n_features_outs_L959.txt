Looking at the `_compute_n_features_outs` method and the provided input:

1. First, the method computes: `output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]`
   - `self.categories_` is `["array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)"]`
   - This is a list with one element that is a string (not an actual array)
   - `len(cats)` for the string `"array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)"` would be 33 (counting characters)

2. Next, it checks `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` - it's `null` (None), so no adjustment

3. Then checks `self._infrequent_enabled` - it's `false`, so returns `output` immediately

So the output should be `[33]`.

However, looking at the structure more carefully: `self.categories_` appears to be a string representation of an array, not the actual array. In a real scenario, `categories_` would be a list of arrays, not strings. But given the input is JSON, we must work with what's provided.

[THOUGHT]
The input shows `categories_` as a list containing a string: `"array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)"`. When we iterate through this list and take `len(cats)`, we get the length of this string, which is 33 characters. Since `_drop_idx_after_grouping` is null and `_infrequent_enabled` is false, we return `[33]`.
