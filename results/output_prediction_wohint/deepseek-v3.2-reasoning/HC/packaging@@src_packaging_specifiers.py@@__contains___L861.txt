[THOUGHT]
Given the input, we need to evaluate the `__contains__` method of the `SpecifierSet` instance. The `__contains__` method simply calls `self.contains(item)`. 

The `self` object has `_specs` as an empty frozenset (represented by the string "frozenset()", but we interpret it as an empty frozenset) and `_prereleases` set to `true` (True in Python). The `item` is a Version object representing '1.0a1', which is a prerelease version.

In the `contains` method:
1. `_coerce_version(item)` returns the Version object since it's already a Version.
2. `installed` is None (from kwargs), so the condition `if installed and version.is_prerelease` is False.
3. `prereleases` is None (default), so in `self.filter([version], prereleases=None)`:
   - Since `self.prereleases` (property) returns `self._prereleases` (True), we set `prereleases = True`.
   - `self._specs` is empty, so we go to the else branch.
   - Since `prereleases` is True, `filter` returns `iter(iterable)`, which is an iterator over the list containing the version.
4. `bool(list(...))` on a non-empty iterator returns True.

Thus, `__contains__` returns True.

The output is a boolean value.
