Looking at the `is_valid_backend` method and the provided input:

1. The backend argument is "Agg"
2. Since it doesn't start with 'module://', it gets lowercased to "agg"
3. The backwards_compat dict doesn't contain "agg" as a key
4. It checks if "agg" is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` - looking at the class definition, "agg" is indeed listed as a builtin backend
5. Therefore, it returns `True` without needing to load entry points

[THOUGHT]
The function `is_valid_backend` receives backend="Agg". It lowercases it to "agg", which is in the builtin backends dictionary. The function returns True without loading entry points since it's a builtin backend.
