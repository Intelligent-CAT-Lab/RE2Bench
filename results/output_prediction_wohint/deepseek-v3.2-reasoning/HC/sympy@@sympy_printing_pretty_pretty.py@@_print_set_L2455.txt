[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the `_print_set` method of the `PrettyPrinter` class. The input `s` is a list of two strings: `["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`. The method first checks if `s` is empty (it's not). Then it sorts the items using `default_sort_key`. For strings, `default_sort_key` returns a tuple where the second element includes the string itself. Comparing the two strings lexicographically, `"Q.integer"` comes before `"Q.positive"`, so the sorted list is `["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`. Then `_print_seq` is called with the sorted list, which creates prettyForm objects for each string and joins them with `", "` as the delimiter. Finally, the result is wrapped in curly braces using `parens('{', '}', ifascii_nougly=True)`. Assuming the printer renders strings without quotes (as is typical for symbols in SymPy sets), the resulting prettyForm represents the string `"{Q.integer, Q.positive}"`. Since the function returns a prettyForm object, but the output format in the previous example was a dictionary with a key `"strpath"`, we similarly output a dictionary with a key `"str"` containing the string representation.
