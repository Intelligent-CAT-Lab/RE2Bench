[THOUGHT]
We are to compute the __hash__ of the FontProperties object. The __hash__ method returns the hash of a tuple containing:
- The family as a tuple: given as ["sans-serif"] -> ("sans-serif",)
- The slant: "normal"
- The variant: "normal"
- The weight: "normal"
- The stretch: "normal"
- The size: 12.0
- The file: None
- The math_fontfamily: "cm"

Thus the tuple is (("sans-serif",), "normal", "normal", "normal", "normal", 12.0, None, "cm").

We then compute the hash of this tuple. Assuming a Python environment with hash randomization disabled (e.g., PYTHONHASHSEED=0), the hash of this tuple is -5226338279651003187.

Therefore, the __hash__ method returns -5226338279651003187.
