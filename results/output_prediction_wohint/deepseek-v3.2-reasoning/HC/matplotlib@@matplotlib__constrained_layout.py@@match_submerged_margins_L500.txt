[THOUGHT]
The function `match_submerged_margins` processes axes in a figure to adjust submerged margins. However, the input `layoutgrids` dictionary uses string keys (e.g., "GridSpec(1, 2)"), while the function expects the keys to be actual `GridSpec` objects. When checking `if ss1.get_gridspec() not in layoutgrids`, the gridspec object returned by `ss1.get_gridspec()` will not match any string key in `layoutgrids`. Therefore, for each axis in the figure, this condition will be true, causing the axis to be removed from `axs` during the loop. Since the figure has two axes and no subfigs, both axes are removed, resulting in an empty list being returned.
