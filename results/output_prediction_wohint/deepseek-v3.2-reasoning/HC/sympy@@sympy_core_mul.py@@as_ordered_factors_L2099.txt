[THOUGHT]
We need to compute `as_ordered_factors` for the expression `w*z`. Assuming `w` and `z` are commutative symbols (default in SymPy), the method first calls `args_cnc`. Since both factors are commutative, `args_cnc` returns `[[w, z], []]`. Then it sorts the commutative part by `sort_key`. The default ordering for symbols is alphabetical by name, so `w` comes before `z`. Thus, the sorted list remains `[w, z]`. The non-commutative part is empty, so the result is `[w, z]`. Representing these as strings gives `["w", "z"]`.
