We are given the function `exptrigsimp` and the input expression as a string: `"sinh(x) + cosh(x)"`. The function simplifies expressions involving trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The main steps are:

1. `exp_trig` function: applied via `bottom_up`. For the entire expression `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`, it considers:
   - The original expression: `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`.
   - Rewritten as `exp`: `sinh(x).rewrite(exp) = (exp(x) - exp(-x))/2`, `cosh(x).rewrite(exp) = (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2`. Summing gives `exp(x)`.
   - Rewritten as `cos`: `sinh(x).rewrite(cos) = -I*sin(I*x)`, `cosh(x).rewrite(cos) = cos(I*x)`. Sum gives `-I*sin(I*x) + cos(I*x)`.
   The minimal `count_ops` is for `exp(x)`, so `exp_trig` returns `exp(x)`.

2. The second `bottom_up` applies function `f`, which is designed for multiplicative expressions. Since `exp(x)` is not a `Mul`, it remains unchanged.

3. The expression does not contain hyperbolic or trigonometric functions after simplification, so `hyper_as_trig` and `TR2i` are not applied.

4. The final expression is `exp(x)`, which does not contain `I`, and the original also does not contain `I`, so it is returned.

Thus, the output of `exptrigsimp` is `exp(x)`.
