The `_get_kernel_params` method processes the kernel parameters based on the `self` attributes. Given that `self.kernel` is "polynomial" and not callable or "precomputed", the method checks the parameters defined in `KERNEL_PARAMS` for the polynomial kernel (assumed to be `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`). Since `self.gamma` is `None`, it is omitted, while `self.coef0` (0.1) and `self.degree` (3.1) are added to the `params` dictionary. The `kernel_params` is `None`, so `params` starts as an empty dictionary. No error is raised because the kernel is not callable or "precomputed".

[THOUGHT]
1. Initialize `params` from `self.kernel_params`, which is `None`, so `params = {}`.
2. Check if `self.kernel` is not callable and not "precomputed": `self.kernel` is "polynomial", so condition is `True`.
3. Iterate over parameters for the "polynomial" kernel (assumed `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`):
   - For 'gamma': `getattr(self, 'gamma')` is `None`, so not added.
   - For 'coef0': `getattr(self, 'coef0')` is 0.1, so `params['coef0'] = 0.1`.
   - For 'degree': `getattr(self, 'degree')` is 3.1, so `params['degree'] = 3.1`.
4. The `elif` condition is skipped because the `if` condition is `True`.
5. Return `params`, which is `{'coef0': 0.1, 'degree': 3.1}`.
