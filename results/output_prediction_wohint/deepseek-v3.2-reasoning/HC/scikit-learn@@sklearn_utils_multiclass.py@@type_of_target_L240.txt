[THOUGHT]
The function `type_of_target` expects `y` to be an array-like object. However, the input provided for `y` is a string: `"array([0, 0, 1, 1])"`. The function begins by validating the input with the condition:

```python
valid = (isinstance(y, Sequence) or issparse(y) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str)) or is_array_api_compliant
```

Since `y` is a string, `isinstance(y, str)` is `True`, making `(not isinstance(y, str))` `False`. Additionally, `is_array_api_compliant` is `False` because the string does not implement the array API. Thus, `valid` evaluates to `False`, leading to a `ValueError` being raised with the message: `"Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got 'array([0, 0, 1, 1])'"`.

Therefore, the function does not return a value but raises an error.
