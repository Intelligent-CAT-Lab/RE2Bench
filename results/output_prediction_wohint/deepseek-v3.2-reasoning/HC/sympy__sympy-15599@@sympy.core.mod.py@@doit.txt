[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of the `doit` function defined inside `Mod.eval`, given `p = 2*t` and `q = t` (interpreted as sympy expressions). The `doit` function handles modulo operations symbolically. Key steps:
- Check conditions: `q` is not zero, `p` and `q` are not infinite or NaN, and no special equalities hold.
- `q.is_Number` is false since `t` is a symbol.
- Compute `r = p / q = (2*t) / t = 2` (simplified assuming `t ≠ 0`).
- `int(r)` succeeds, giving `d = 2`.
- Compute `rv = p - d*q = 2*t - 2*t = 0`.
- Check `(rv * q < 0)`: `0 * t = 0`, which is not less than 0, so no adjustment.
- Return `rv = 0`.
Thus, `doit` returns the integer `0`.
