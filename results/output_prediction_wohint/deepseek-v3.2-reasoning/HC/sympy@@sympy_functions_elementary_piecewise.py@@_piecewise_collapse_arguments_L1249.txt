[THOUGHT]
The function `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` processes a list of `(expr, cond)` pairs. The input `_args` is given as a list of strings representing tuples: `"(1, x < 0)"` and `"(3, True)"`. In the actual execution, these would be parsed as tuples: `(1, x < 0)` and `(3, True)`, where `x < 0` is a `Lt` relational and `True` is a boolean.

Processing each pair:
- First pair: `expr=1`, `cond=x < 0`. 
  - `cond.replace(...)` likely leaves it unchanged.
  - `current_cond` is empty, so condition not seen before.
  - `cond` is a `Relational`, but its negated canonical not in `current_cond`.
  - Add `cond` to `current_cond` and append `ExprCondPair(1, x < 0)` to `newargs`.
- Second pair: `expr=3`, `cond=True`.
  - `cond.replace(...)` leaves it unchanged.
  - `True` not in `current_cond` (which contains `x < 0`).
  - `cond` is not an `And` or `Relational`, so no extra processing.
  - Add `True` to `current_cond` and append `ExprCondPair(3, True)` to `newargs`.

The function returns a list of `ExprCondPair` objects, which are essentially tuples. The output should be a JSON-serializable list of pairs, with the relational condition as a string and the boolean as a literal boolean.
