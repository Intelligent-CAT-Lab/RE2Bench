[THOUGHT]
We are given two Term objects: both with coefficient 1, empty numer Factors, and empty denom Factors. The mul method performs:
1. Multiply coefficients: 1 * 1 = 1.
2. Multiply numer: empty Factors * empty Factors = empty Factors.
3. Multiply denom: similarly empty Factors.
4. Apply normal between numer and denom: both empty, so they remain empty.
5. Return a new Term with coefficient 1 and empty numer and denom.
Thus, the result is a Term identical to the inputs. To represent this in JSON, we output the attributes: coeff, numer (as an empty dict), and denom (as an empty dict).
