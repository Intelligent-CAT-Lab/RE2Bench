The output of `sympify` with the given input is a SymPy expression representing the mathematical expression `2500/pi`. Since the function returns a SymPy object and the expected output should be JSON-serializable, the most appropriate representation is the string form of the expression, which is `"2500/pi"`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The input `a` is the string `"2500/pi"`, and `strict` is `True`.
2. The function checks various conditions (e.g., `__sympy__` attribute, converters) but none apply to a string.
3. Since `a` is a string and `strict` is `True`, the function proceeds to parse the string using `parse_expr`.
4. The `parse_expr` function is called with default transformations (including `convert_xor`) and `evaluate` set by `global_parameters.evaluate` (default behavior assumed).
5. The string `"2500/pi"` is parsed into a SymPy expression: `2500/pi` (where `pi` is the SymPy constant).
6. The function returns this expression. For JSON output, the expression is represented as its string form.

Thus, the output is the string `"2500/pi"`.
