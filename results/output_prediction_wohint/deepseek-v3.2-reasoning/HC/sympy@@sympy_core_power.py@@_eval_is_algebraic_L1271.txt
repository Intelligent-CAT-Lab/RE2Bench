The `_eval_is_algebraic` method for the Pow object representing `cos(phi)**2` evaluates to `False` because the base `cos(phi)` is not algebraic (it is a transcendental trigonometric function), and the exponent is a nonzero rational number. The method's logic leads to returning `False` when the base is non-algebraic and the exponent is nonzero.

[THOUGHT]
The method `_eval_is_algebraic` is called on a Pow object with base = `cos(phi)` and exp = `2`. Since `exp` is rational (integer), the code enters the `elif self.exp.is_rational` branch. Assuming `base.is_algebraic` is `False` (as `cos(phi)` is transcendental for a generic symbol `phi`), the condition `if self.base.is_algebraic is False` evaluates to `True`, leading to `return self.exp.is_zero`. Since `exp` is `2`, `exp.is_zero` is `False`. Therefore, the method returns `False`.
