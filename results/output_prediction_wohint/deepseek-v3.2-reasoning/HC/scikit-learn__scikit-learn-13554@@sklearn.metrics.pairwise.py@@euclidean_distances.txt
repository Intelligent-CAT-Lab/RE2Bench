[THOUGHT]
The input provides X and Y as strings representing 1x4 arrays. The function `euclidean_distances` computes the squared Euclidean distance between the rows when `squared=True`. After parsing the strings into numpy arrays, the calculation proceeds using the norm-dot product formula. The result is a 1x1 array containing the squared distance, approximately 1.165176.
