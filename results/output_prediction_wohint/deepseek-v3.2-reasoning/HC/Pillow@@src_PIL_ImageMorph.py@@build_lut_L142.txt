[THOUGHT]
The function `build_lut` processes patterns to create a lookup table (LUT) for morphological operations. Given the input patterns `["4:(... .1. .0.)->0", "4:(... .1. ..0)->0"]`, which correspond to an erosion8 operation, the LUT is initialized by `build_default_lut` to have `lut[i] = 1` if the center bit (bit4) of `i` is 1, else 0. Then, the patterns set `lut[i]` to 0 when the center is 1 and any neighbor is 0. After processing all patterns and their rotations, the final LUT has `lut[i] = 1` only if all nine bits (center and all eight neighbors) are 1, which occurs only when `i = 511` (binary `111111111`). For all other `i` from 0 to 510, `lut[i] = 0`. Thus, the output bytearray has 512 elements, all 0 except at index 511 where it is 1.
