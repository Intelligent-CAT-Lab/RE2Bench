[THOUGHT]
The `handle` function is called with `expr = 1/(a - b)`. After analyzing the code:

1. `fraction(expr)` gives numerator `n = 1` and denominator `d = a - b`.
2. The initial conditions do not apply because `expr` is not an atom, `d` is not an atom, `n` is `S.One`, and `d` is not a `Mul`.
3. With `symbolic=True` (assumed default), the check `if not symbolic and d.free_symbols` does not trigger.
4. `d = a - b` is not a power (`ispow2` false) and not a `Pow` with integer exponent.
5. Since `d.is_Add` is true, the function proceeds to the while loop.
6. In the while loop, `Add.make_args(d)` gives terms `a` and `-b`. Processing these leads to `collected` having one key with empty tuple and values `[a, -b]`, resulting in `rterms = [(1, a - b)]`.
7. `nrad = len(rterms) - 1 = 0` because the first term's first element is `S.One`. Since `nrad < 1`, the loop breaks immediately without modifying `n` or `d`.
8. `keep` remains `True`, so the function returns `_unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d)`, which is `1/(a - b)`.

Thus, the output of `handle` is the expression `1/(a - b)`.
