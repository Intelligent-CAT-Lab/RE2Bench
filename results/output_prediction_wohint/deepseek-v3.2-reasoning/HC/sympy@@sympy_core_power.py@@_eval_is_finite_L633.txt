[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_is_finite` is called on a `Pow` object representing `cos(phi)**2`. The exponent `2` is positive, so the first condition `self.exp.is_negative` is false. Then `c1 = self.base.is_finite` is evaluated. The base `cos(phi)` is a symbolic expression with no assumptions about `phi`, so `is_finite` returns `None`. The function immediately returns `None` because `c1 is None`. Therefore, the output is `None`.
