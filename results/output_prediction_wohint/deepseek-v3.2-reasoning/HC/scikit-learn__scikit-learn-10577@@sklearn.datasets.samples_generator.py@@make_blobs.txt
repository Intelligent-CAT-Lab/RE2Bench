The function `make_blobs` generates synthetic data for clustering. Given the inputs: 
- `n_samples=50` (integer)
- `n_features=2` 
- `centers` is provided as a string representation of a 3x2 array: `[[0.,0.], [1.,1.], [0.,1.]]`
- `cluster_std` is provided as a string representation of a list: `[0.05, 0.2, 0.4]`
- `random_state=0`

However, in JSON format, `centers` and `cluster_std` are strings. The function expects array-like inputs, but it does not automatically convert strings to arrays. Therefore, passing strings would cause an error in `check_array` because it would treat the string as a single element. But given the context of the problem (simulating execution), I assume the intended input is actual arrays (list of lists and list). So I will interpret `centers` as a list of lists and `cluster_std` as a list.

Step-by-step execution:
1. `generator = check_random_state(0)` creates a `np.random.RandomState` instance seeded with 0.
2. `n_samples` is an integer, so we go into the first branch. `centers` is not an integer (it's a list of lists), so we go to the else clause: `centers = check_array(centers)`. This converts `centers` to a numpy array of shape (3,2). Then `n_features = centers.shape[1] = 2` and `n_centers = centers.shape[0] = 3`.
3. `cluster_std` is a list of length 3, which matches `n_centers`. Since it's a list, not a single number, we skip the conversion that multiplies by ones.
4. Since `n_samples` is an integer, we compute `n_samples_per_center = [int(50 // 3)] * 3 = [16,16,16]`, then add the remainder to the first two: `[17,17,16]`.
5. For each center i, generate `n_samples_per_center[i]` points from a normal distribution with mean `centers[i]` and standard deviation `cluster_std[i]`:
   - Cluster 0: 17 points from N([0,0], 0.05)
   - Cluster 1: 17 points from N([1,1], 0.2)
   - Cluster 2: 16 points from N([0,1], 0.4)
6. Concatenate all points into X (shape (50,2)) and create y labels (length 50).
7. Since `shuffle=True`, we shuffle the data using the same `generator`. The shuffling is deterministic because `random_state` is fixed.

The exact numerical output depends on the random seed. With `random_state=0`, the output is deterministic. However, without actually running the code, I cannot compute the exact 50 points. Therefore, I will describe the output structure and provide a sample based on typical behavior.

Given the complexity, the output should be a JSON representation of the tuple (X, y), where X is a list of 50 lists (each with 2 floats) and y is a list of 50 integers (0,1,2). But since I cannot generate the exact values here, I will output a placeholder indicating the shape and a note.
