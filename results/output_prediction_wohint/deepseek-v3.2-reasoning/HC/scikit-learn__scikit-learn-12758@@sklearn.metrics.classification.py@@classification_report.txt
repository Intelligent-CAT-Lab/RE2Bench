The input consists of two arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` represented as strings. After parsing, we have 100 samples with three classes: 'red', 'blue', and 'greengreengreengreengreen'. The confusion matrix computed from the data is:

- For true 'red': predicted 'red' 20, 'blue' 8, 'greengreengreengreengreen' 4.
- For true 'blue': predicted 'red' 10, 'blue' 10, 'greengreengreengreengreen' 12.
- For true 'greengreengreengreengreen': predicted 'red' 12, 'blue' 10, 'greengreengreengreengreen' 14.

Using these, the precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class are calculated. The micro average is 0.44 for precision, recall, and F1-score. The macro and weighted averages are also computed. The classification report is formatted as a string with 2-digit precision.

[THOUGHT]
The classification report is generated with default parameters (output_dict=False), so the output is a formatted string. The computed metrics are:

- Class 'red': precision=0.48, recall=0.62, f1-score=0.54, support=32
- Class 'blue': precision=0.36, recall=0.31, f1-score=0.33, support=32
- Class 'greengreengreengreengreen': precision=0.47, recall=0.39, f1-score=0.42, support=36
- Accuracy (micro avg): 0.44
- Macro avg: precision=0.43, recall=0.44, f1-score=0.43, support=100
- Weighted avg: precision=0.44, recall=0.44, f1-score=0.44, support=100

The report string is built accordingly.
