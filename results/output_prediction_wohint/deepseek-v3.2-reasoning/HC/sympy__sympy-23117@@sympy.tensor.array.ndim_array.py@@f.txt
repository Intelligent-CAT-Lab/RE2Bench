[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is defined inside `_scan_iterable_shape` and is recursive. The input `pointer` is a string: `"sin(x)**2 + \"cos(x)\"**2"`. In Python, strings are iterable, so `isinstance(pointer, Iterable)` returns `True`. The base case for non-iterable objects does not apply. Since the string is not empty, the function attempts to iterate over each character, calling `f` recursively on each character. Each character is itself a string of length 1, which is also iterable, leading to infinite recursion. However, in the context of SymPy's array creation, `_scan_iterable_shape` is designed to process nested iterables with non-iterable leaves (like numbers or SymPy expressions). A string representing a mathematical expression is likely intended to be treated as a non-iterable leaf. Therefore, assuming the pointer is a non-iterable SymPy expression, `f` would return `([pointer], ())`. The shape is an empty tuple because it's a scalar.
