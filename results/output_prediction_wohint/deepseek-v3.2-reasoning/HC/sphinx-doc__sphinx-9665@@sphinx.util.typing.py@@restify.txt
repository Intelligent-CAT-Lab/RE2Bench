[THOUGHT]
The function `restify` handles various types, including `None`. In the input, `cls` is `null`, which in Python is `None`. The first condition in the function checks if `cls is None or cls is NoneType`, which will be true. Therefore, it returns the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.

```
{
    "result": ":py:obj:`None`"
}
