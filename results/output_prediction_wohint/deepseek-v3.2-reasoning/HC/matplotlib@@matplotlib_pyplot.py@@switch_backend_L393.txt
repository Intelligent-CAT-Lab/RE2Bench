The function `switch_backend` returns `None` after performing backend switching operations. Given the input `{"newbackend": "Agg"}`, the function loads the "Agg" backend module, sets up the backend environment, and returns `None` without raising any exceptions, as "Agg" is a valid non-interactive backend.

[THOUGHT]
The function `switch_backend` is called with `newbackend="Agg"`. It checks if `newbackend` is the auto-backend sentinel (false), loads the backend module via `backend_registry.load_backend_module("Agg")`, retrieves the canvas class, and checks the required interactive framework (none for Agg). It then creates a `backend_mod` class, updates it with module attributes, and checks for `new_figure_manager` and `show` functions. Since "Agg" provides `new_figure_manager` and inherits `manager_class` from `FigureCanvasBase` (which has `pyplot_show`), no ValueError is raised. The function sets `rcParams['backend']` to "Agg", updates global backend references, calls `install_repl_displayhook()` (which succeeds), and returns `None`.
