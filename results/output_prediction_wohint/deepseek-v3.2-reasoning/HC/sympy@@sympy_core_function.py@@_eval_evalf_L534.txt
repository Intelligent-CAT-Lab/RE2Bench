[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_eval_evalf` is called with `prec=30`.
2. The `self` object only has the attribute `nargs` set to `"{1}"`. It does not have `_eval_mpmath` or `_imp_` attributes, and we don't know its class name to look up an mpmath function.
3. Since `_eval_mpmath` is not provided, `func` is obtained via `_get_mpmath_func(self.func.__name__)`. Without knowing the class name, we cannot determine if mpmath has a corresponding function. However, given the minimal input, it is safe to assume that no such function exists, so `func` becomes `None`.
4. The `_imp_` attribute is also not provided, so it defaults to `None`.
5. Therefore, the method returns `None`.
