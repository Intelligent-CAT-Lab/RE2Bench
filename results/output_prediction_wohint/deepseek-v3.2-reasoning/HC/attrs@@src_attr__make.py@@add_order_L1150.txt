[THOUGHT]
The input for the `add_order` method is missing critical attributes (`_cls`, `_attrs`, `_cls_dict`) that the method requires to execute properly. Without these, we cannot determine the exact changes to `_cls_dict` or the generated methods. However, the method returns `self` after updating `_cls_dict` with four ordering methods (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`). Given the incomplete input, the output would be the same `self` object, but we cannot accurately represent the updated state. Thus, the output is simply the input `self` object.
