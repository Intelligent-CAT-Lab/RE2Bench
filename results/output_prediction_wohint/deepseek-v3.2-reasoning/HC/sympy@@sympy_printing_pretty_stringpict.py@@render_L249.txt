[THOUGHT]
The render method checks if wrap_line is true. Since num_columns is null, it calls self.terminal_width() which returns 0 (due to fallback), but then ncols is set to 80 because ncols <= 0. The width of self.picture[0] is 23 (length of "{Q.integer, Q.positive}"). Since 23 <= 80, the condition self.width() <= ncols is true, so the method returns '\n'.join(self.picture), which is simply "{Q.integer, Q.positive}". No wrapping occurs.
