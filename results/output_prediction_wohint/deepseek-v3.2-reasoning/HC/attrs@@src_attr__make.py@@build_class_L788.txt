[THOUGHT]
The input provided for the `build_class` method is incomplete. The `self` object in the input only contains three attributes (`auto_attribs`, `these`, `has_custom_setattr`), but the `_ClassBuilder` instance requires many other attributes (such as `_cls`, `_slots`, `_cls_dict`, `_attrs`, etc.) to execute the `build_class` method. Without these, it is impossible to simulate the method or predict its output. The method returns a class object, but the necessary context is missing.
