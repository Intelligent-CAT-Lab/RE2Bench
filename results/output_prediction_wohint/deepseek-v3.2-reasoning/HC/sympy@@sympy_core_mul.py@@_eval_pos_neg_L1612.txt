[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_pos_neg` is called on a `Mul` object representing `-phi` (i.e., `-1 * phi`) with an initial `sign=1`. The method iterates over the factors:
- For `-1`: it is extended negative, so `sign` becomes `-1`.
- For `phi`: it is extended positive (since phi is the positive golden ratio), so the loop continues without changing `sign` or flags.

After the loop, `sign = -1`, `saw_NON = False`, and `saw_NOT = False`. Since `sign < 0`, the function returns `False`.
