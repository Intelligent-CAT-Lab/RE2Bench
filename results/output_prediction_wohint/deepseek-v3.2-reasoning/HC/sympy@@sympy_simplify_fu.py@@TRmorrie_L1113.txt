[THOUGHT]
The input is a single cosine expression, cos(phi). The TRmorrie function is designed to apply Morrie's law to products of cosines. Since cos(phi) is not a product, the function returns it unchanged. The bottom-up traversal does not modify the expression. Therefore, the output is cos(phi).
