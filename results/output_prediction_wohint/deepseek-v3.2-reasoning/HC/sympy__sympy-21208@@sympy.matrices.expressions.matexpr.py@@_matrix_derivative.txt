[THOUGHT]
We need to compute `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` for the given input. The `expr` is a 2x2 matrix, but its elements are unspecified (`_mat`: null). In the absence of explicit elements, we assume the matrix is independent of `x` (constant). Then the derivative with respect to `x` is the zero matrix. Following the function logic:

1. `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)` returns `[_LeftRightArgs([S.One, S.One], higher=expr._eval_derivative(x))]`.
2. `expr._eval_derivative(x)` applies element-wise differentiation, yielding a 2x2 zero matrix (since elements are constant).
3. Building the `_LeftRightArgs` gives `[S.One, S.One, zero_matrix]`.
4. After conversion and rank calculation: each `S.One` has shape (1,1) (trivial dimensions), the zero matrix has shape (2,2) → rank = 2.
5. Since rank ≤ 2, `contract_one_dims` is called on `[S.One, S.One, zero_matrix]`, which simplifies to the zero matrix.
6. The final result is `Add.fromiter([zero_matrix])`, i.e., the 2x2 zero matrix.

Thus, the output is a 2x2 zero matrix. We represent it similarly to the input format, but with explicit zero entries.
