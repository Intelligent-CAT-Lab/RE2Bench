The `_make_test_folds` function computes fold assignments for stratified k-fold cross-validation. Given the input with `n_splits=5`, `shuffle=False`, and the provided `y` array (which corresponds to the Iris dataset with 150 samples and 3 classes, each with 50 samples), the function will assign each sample to one of 5 folds while preserving class proportions.

The steps are:
1. Encode the labels `y` to ensure classes are ordered by first occurrence. This results in `y_encoded` where original class 0 remains 0, original class 1 becomes 2, and original class 2 becomes 1.
2. Sort `y_encoded` stably, grouping samples by class while preserving the original order within each class.
3. Compute allocation counts per fold per class by striding over the sorted list with step `n_splits=5`. Since each class has 50 samples, each fold receives exactly 10 samples from each class.
4. Assign fold indices to each class sequentially: the first 10 samples of each class in the original order get fold 0, the next 10 get fold 1, and so on.

The resulting `test_folds` array is of length 150, with values 0 to 4. The exact assignment depends on the order of samples in `y`. Given the input `y`, the fold assignments are computed as described.
