[THOUGHT]
The expression is `2*pi`, which is a multiplication of two real constants: 2 and pi. The `as_real_imag` method computes the real and imaginary parts of a complex expression. Since both factors are real, the product is real, so the imaginary part is zero. The algorithm processes each factor: both have zero imaginary part, so they are added to the real coefficient list. The resulting real part is `2*pi` and the imaginary part is `0`. Thus, the output is a tuple `(2*pi, 0)`.
