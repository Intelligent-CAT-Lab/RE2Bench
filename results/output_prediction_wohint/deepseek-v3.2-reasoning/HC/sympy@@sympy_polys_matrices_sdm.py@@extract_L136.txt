Let’s walk through it step by step.  

We’re given an `SDM` object with `shape = (3, 3)` and `domain = "ZZ"`.  
The `extract` method is called with `rows = [0, 1, 2]` and `cols = [0]`.  

First, check the early exit condition in `extract`:  

> `if not (self and rows and cols):`  

`self` is a dictionary representation of the matrix — in the input, `self` is given only as `{"shape": ..., "domain": ...}` but not with actual `elemsdict` data inside `self`.  
Actually, in the JSON input provided, `self` contains `"shape"`, `"rows"`, `"cols"`, `"domain"`, but **not** any key-value pairs representing nonzero entries.  
That means `self` as a dictionary is empty.  

`self and rows and cols` → `{}` is falsy, `rows = [0,1,2]` is truthy, `cols = [0]` truthy.  
So `self` is falsy → condition `not (self and rows and cols)` is `True`.  

Thus the method returns:  
`return self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)`  

`len(rows) = 3`, `len(cols) = 1`, so `shape = (3, 1)`.  
`self.zeros((3,1), "ZZ")` returns an `SDM` with empty dictionary `{}` and shape `(3,1)` and domain `ZZ`.  

Therefore, output is:  
```json
{
    "shape": [3, 1],
    "rows": 3,
    "cols": 1,
    "domain": "ZZ"
}
```  

Actually, in the `extract` method, the return is `self.new(sdm2, ...)` when early exit not taken, or `self.zeros(...)` when taken. `self.zeros` calls `cls({}, shape, domain)`. The `__init__` of `SDM` expects `elemsdict` as first arg, here `{}`, shape as second, domain as third. The `__init__` also sets `self.shape`, `self.rows`, `self.cols`.  

The output format requested is not explicitly stated in this problem, but from earlier example in this set, likely they want the returned SDM’s attributes in JSON form.  

So, final answer:  

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "shape": [3, 1],
    "rows": 3,
    "cols": 1,
    "domain": "ZZ"
}
```
