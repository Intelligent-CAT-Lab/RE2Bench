[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_real_imag` is called with `self` as the Mul object representing "11*pi/6" and `real=True`. The goal is to determine if the expression is real (since `real=True`). 

The expression "11*pi/6" is a multiplication of constants: 11, pi, and 1/6 (since division by 6 is multiplication by 1/6). All these factors are extended real numbers (finite, non-zero, and real). The method iterates through each argument:

1. For each argument (11, pi, 1/6):
   - `(t.is_complex or t.is_infinite) is False and t.is_extended_real is False` is false because all are extended real.
   - `t.is_imaginary` is false for all.
   - `t.is_extended_real` is true for all, so the `zero` flag remains `False` (since none are zero).

2. After the loop, `zero=False` and `t_not_re_im=None`.

3. Since `t_not_re_im` is `None` and `zero` is `False`, the condition `elif zero is False` is true, so the method returns `real`, which is `True`.

Thus, the output is `True`.
