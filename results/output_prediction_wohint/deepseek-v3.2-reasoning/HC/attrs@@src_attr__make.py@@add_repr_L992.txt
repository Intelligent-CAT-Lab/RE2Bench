[THOUGHT]
The `add_repr` method of `_ClassBuilder` returns `self` after performing internal modifications (like appending to `_script_snippets` and setting `_repr_added` to True). Given the input where `self` is represented as the string `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"` and `ns` is `null`, the method will execute and return the same instance. Since the return value is the instance itself, and the input represents it as a string, the output should reflect that same representation. The internal state changes do not affect the instance's string representation in this context.

Therefore, the output is the instance, which is the same as the input `self`.
