The input is a simple email header string "download-url: VaLuE". The `parse_email` function processes this header, converting the header name to lowercase ("download-url") and extracting the value ["VaLuE"]. Since the `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` is not provided in the context, "download-url" is not recognized as a standard metadata field, so it is placed in the `unparsed` dictionary. The email has no body, so the payload is an empty string and does not affect the output. Thus, the function returns an empty dictionary for `raw` and `unparsed` containing the header.

```json
[
  {},
  {
    "download-url": ["VaLuE"]
  }
]
```
