[THOUGHT]
We are asked to simulate the `_fit` method of the `RFE` class with the given inputs. The input includes:
- `self`: an RFE instance with estimator set to an SVC with linear kernel (though represented as a string), `n_features_to_select=4`, `step=0.1`, `importance_getter='auto'`, and `verbose=0`.
- `X`: a sparse matrix of shape (150, 10) with 1500 stored elements (effectively dense).
- `y`: an array of length 150 with three classes (0, 1, 2).
- `step_score`: `null` (i.e., `None`).

The `_fit` method performs recursive feature elimination. Key steps:
1. Validate `X` and `y`. `X` has 10 features.
2. Determine `n_features_to_select`: since it's an integer (4), use directly.
3. Determine `step`: since `step=0.1` (float between 0 and 1), compute `step = int(max(1, 0.1 * 10)) = 1`.
4. Initialize `support_` as an array of 10 `True` values and `ranking_` as an array of 10 ones.
5. Since `step_score` is `None`, no step-related lists are initialized.
6. While the number of selected features (`sum(support_)`) is greater than 4, iterate:
   - Each iteration fits the estimator on the current features, computes importances (using `_get_feature_importances` with `transform_func='square'`), ranks features by importance (ascending), and removes the least important feature (since `step=1`).
   - After each removal, `ranking_` is incremented for all currently removed features.
   - This continues until exactly 4 features remain.
7. Finally, fit the estimator on the 4 selected features and set attributes:
   - `estimator_`: the fitted estimator on selected features.
   - `n_features_`: 4.
   - `support_`: boolean array indicating selected features.
   - `ranking_`: integer array where 1 indicates selected features, higher numbers indicate earlier elimination.

Without actual data values, we cannot compute the exact importances and thus the exact elimination order. However, we can deduce:
- The loop runs 6 times (removing 6 features, one per iteration).
- The final `support_` will have 4 `True` and 6 `False`.
- The final `ranking_` will have four 1's for the selected features, and the removed features will have values from 2 to 7 (depending on elimination order).
- `estimator_` will be a fitted SVC on the 4 selected features.

Given the lack of data, we assume a plausible elimination order (e.g., features 0-5 removed in order). The output should reflect the updated `self` with the new attributes.
