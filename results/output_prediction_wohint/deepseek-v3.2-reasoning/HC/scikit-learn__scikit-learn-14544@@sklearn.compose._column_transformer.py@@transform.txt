The `transform` method requires the transformer to be fitted, indicated by the presence of `transformers_`. Although the input shows `transformers_` as `null`, for the method to execute without raising a `NotFittedError`, we assume it is fitted with an empty list of transformers. Given the state:

- `_n_features` is 2 (from fitting on data with 2 features).
- `_remainder` is `["remainder", "drop", null]`, meaning no columns are selected and remainder drops all.
- Input `X` is a 3×3 array (3 rows, 3 features).

Since there are no transformers and remainder is `'drop'`, all columns are dropped during transformation. The method `_fit_transform` returns an empty list, leading to `np.zeros((3, 0))`, a 3×0 array. In JSON, this is represented as an empty list for each row.

[THOUGHT]
The provided state suggests a fitted ColumnTransformer with no transformers and remainder='drop'. The input X has 3 features, but the transformer was fitted on 2 features (as per `_n_features`). Since no columns are selected and remainder drops all, the output is an empty array with shape (3,0). The `transform` method returns `np.zeros((X.shape[0], 0))`, resulting in a 3×0 array.
