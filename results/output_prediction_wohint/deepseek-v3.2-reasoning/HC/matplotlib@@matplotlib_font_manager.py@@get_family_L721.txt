Looking at the `get_family` method in the FontProperties class, it simply returns `self._family`. The input shows that `self._family` is set to `["Helvetica"]`.

[THOUGHT]
The `get_family` method is straightforward - it returns the `_family` attribute of the object. From the input JSON, we can see that `self._family` is set to `["Helvetica"]`. Therefore, calling `get_family()` will return this list.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "family": ["Helvetica"]
}
```
