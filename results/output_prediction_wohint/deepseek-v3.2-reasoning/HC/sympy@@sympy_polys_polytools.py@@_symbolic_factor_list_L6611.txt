[THOUGHT]
The function `_symbolic_factor_list` is called with `expr = "cos(phi)"`, which is interpreted as a SymPy expression `cos(phi)`. Since `cos(phi)` is not a polynomial, the attempt to convert it to a polynomial via `_poly_from_expr` fails, raising `PolificationFailed`. Thus, `cos(phi)` is treated as an irreducible factor with exponent 1. The coefficient is 1. The return value is the tuple `(1, [(cos(phi), 1)])`. In JSON format, this is represented as a list with the coefficient and a list of factor–exponent pairs, where each pair is itself a list.
