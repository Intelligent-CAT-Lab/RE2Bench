[THOUGHT]
The function `_hstack` expects `Xs` to be a list of arrays or sparse matrices. However, the provided input specifies `Xs` as `null` (which becomes `None` in Python). When the function executes, it first checks `self.sparse_output_`, which is `false`, so it goes to the else branch. There, it attempts to iterate over `Xs` with the list comprehension `[f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]`. Since `Xs` is `None`, this raises a `TypeError` because `None` is not iterable. Thus, the function does not successfully return a value; instead, it raises an exception.
