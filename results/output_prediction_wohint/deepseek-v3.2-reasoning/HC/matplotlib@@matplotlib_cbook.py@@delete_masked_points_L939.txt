[THOUGHT]
We are simulating `delete_masked_points` with three arguments: two arrays (represented as strings in the input) and `None`. Interpreting the array strings as lists of floats, we have:
- arg1 = [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45]
- arg2 = [0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95]
- arg3 = None

The function processes these:
1. `is_scalar_or_string(arg1)` returns `False` because it's a list (not a string and iterable), so no `ValueError`.
2. `nrecs = 10` (length of arg1).
3. `margs` becomes `[array1, array2, None]` where array1 and array2 are numpy arrays from the lists.
4. `seqlist` is `[True, True, False]`.
5. Masks are computed for array1 and array2, both all `True` because all values are finite.
6. Combined mask is all `True`, so no points are removed.
7. Neither array is a `MaskedArray`, so no filling.
8. The function returns `margs` = `[array1, array2, None]`.

Since JSON cannot represent numpy arrays, we output the arrays as lists of floats, preserving `null` for `None`.
