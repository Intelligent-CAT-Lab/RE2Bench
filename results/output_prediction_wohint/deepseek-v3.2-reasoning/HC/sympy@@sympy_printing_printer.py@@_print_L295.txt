The `_print` method attempts to find a specialized printing method for the given expression. Since `expr` is a string (`"phi"`), it looks for `_print_str` in the printer class. However, the provided Printer base class does not define `_print_str`. Therefore, it falls back to `emptyPrinter`, which returns `str(expr)`. Since `expr` is the string `"phi"`, the output is simply `"phi"`.
