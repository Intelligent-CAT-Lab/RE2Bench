[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the `_convert_other` method with the given input. The input includes a `self` object, `column`, `field`, and `recformat`. The `column` has `_format` "K" and `_physical_values` true. The `field` is given as the string `"[2 4]"`, which we interpret as a numpy array [2,4]. The `recformat` is "i8".

We simulate the method step by step:

1. Call `_get_scale_factors(column)`: returns `(False, False, True, False, False, 1, 0, None)` because `_str` and `_bool` are false, `_number` true, scaling factors are null so `_scale` and `_zero` false, bscale=1, bzero=0, dim=None.

2. The condition `if not _str and isinstance(self._coldefs, _AsciiColDefs)` is false because we assume `self._coldefs` is not an `_AsciiColDefs`.

3. `dim` is None, so skip reshaping.

4. The condition `if _number and (_scale or _zero) and (not column._physical_values)` is false because `_scale` and `_zero` are false and `column._physical_values` is true.

5. The condition `elif _bool` is false.

6. The condition `elif _str` is false.

7. The condition `if dim and (not isinstance(recformat, _FormatP))` is false.

Thus, the function returns the field unchanged.

Therefore, the output is the field array [2,4].

We output this as a JSON object with key "field" and value [2,4].
