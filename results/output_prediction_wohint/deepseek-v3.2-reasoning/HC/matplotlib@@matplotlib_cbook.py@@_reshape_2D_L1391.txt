[THOUGHT]
The function `_reshape_2D` expects an array-like input `X`. However, in the provided input, `X` is given as a string representation of a numpy array. The function `_unpack_to_numpy` does not parse string representations, so if `X` is a string, it remains a string. This leads to iterating over each character, producing an output that is a list containing a 1‑D array of characters. This output is unlikely to be the intended one for a reshaping function.

Given the context of the function (from matplotlib's `cbook` module) and the fact that the input resembles a numpy array literal, it is more plausible that the input is meant to be interpreted as a numpy array. Therefore, we treat `X` as a 2D numpy array of shape (5, 3) with the provided values. 

Under this interpretation:
1. `_unpack_to_numpy` returns the array unchanged.
2. `isinstance(X, np.ndarray)` is `True`.
3. `X = X.transpose()` results in shape (3, 5).
4. Since `X.ndim == 2`, the function returns `[np.reshape(x, -1) for x in X]`, where each `x` is a row of the transposed array (i.e., a column of the original array).
5. The result is a list of three 1‑D arrays, each containing one column of the original array.

Thus, the output is a list of three lists, each representing a column of the original 5×3 array.
