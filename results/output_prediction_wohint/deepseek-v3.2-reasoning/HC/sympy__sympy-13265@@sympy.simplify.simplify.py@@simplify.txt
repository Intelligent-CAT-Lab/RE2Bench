[THOUGHT]
The input expr is a string: "(\"exp(x)\" + \"exp(-x)\")/(y*(\"exp(x)\" - \"exp(-x)\"))". However, the inner quotes likely result from JSON escaping and are not intended to be part of the expression. In a typical mathematical context, the expression should be (exp(x) + exp(-x))/(y*(exp(x) - exp(-x))). The simplify function will sympify this string, but the inner quotes would cause parsing errors. Assuming the intended expression is without the inner quotes, sympify converts it to a SymPy expression. The expression simplifies to coth(x)/y via hyperbolic identities, as confirmed by steps like exptrigsimp. The default measure count_ops favors this simpler form.
