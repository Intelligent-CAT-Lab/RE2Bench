[THOUGHT]
We are given an instance of `_MultimetricScorer` with one scorer named "score" which is a string (not a callable scorer object). The `__call__` method is invoked with an estimator string and one argument (a string representing an array). Since `_routing_enabled()` is false, we go to the else branch and set up `routed_params` with an empty dictionary for the scorer. Then, when trying to call the scorer (which is a string) with the given arguments, it raises a TypeError. Since `self._raise_exc` is false, the exception is caught and the traceback is formatted and stored in the `scores` dictionary under the key "score". Therefore, the function returns a dictionary with the key "score" mapping to the traceback string of the TypeError.
