Looking at the `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` method:

1. The method starts with the condition: `if not self._infrequent_enabled: return drop_idx`
2. From the input, `self._infrequent_enabled` is `false` (boolean false)
3. Therefore, the method immediately returns `drop_idx` without any further processing
4. `drop_idx` in the input is `"0"` (a string)

[THOUGHT]
The method `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` checks if `self._infrequent_enabled` is true. Since it's false in the input, the method immediately returns the input `drop_idx` parameter, which is the string "0". No further processing occurs.

```
{
    "return": "0"
}
