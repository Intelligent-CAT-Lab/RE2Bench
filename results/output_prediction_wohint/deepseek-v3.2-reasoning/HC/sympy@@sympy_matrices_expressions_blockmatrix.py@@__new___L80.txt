[THOUGHT]
The given input calls `BlockMatrix.__new__` with a single argument: a list of two rows, each containing two matrices represented as strings. The function checks if the input is a valid block matrix by verifying row and column dimensions. The matrices have dimensions:
- Row 0: [3x2, 3x3] → row counts {3}, column counts for column 0: {2}, column 1: {3}.
- Row 1: [2x2, 2x3] → row counts {2}, column counts for column 0: {2}, column 1: {3}.
All checks pass, so an `ImmutableDenseMatrix` containing the blocks is created, and a `BlockMatrix` instance is returned with this matrix as its only argument. The output is the new `BlockMatrix` object, which we represent by its `_args` attribute, containing the nested list of matrices as strings.
