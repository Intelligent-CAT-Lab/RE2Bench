The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` computes sparse coding coefficients using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit on a Gram matrix. Given the inputs:
- `Gram`: A 12×12 symmetric positive-definite matrix.
- `Xy`: A 12×1 vector.
- `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1 (so we seek 1 non-zero coefficient).
- `tol`: null (not used).
- `norms_squared`: [5.44055527] (not used since `tol` is null).
- `copy_Xy`: false.

The function proceeds as follows:
1. It validates inputs and sets defaults.
2. Since `tol` is null and `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1, it will stop after selecting 1 atom.
3. It calls `_gram_omp` for each column of `Xy` (only one column here).
4. In `_gram_omp`:
   - Initializes variables and starts with `n_active = 0`.
   - Finds the atom with maximum absolute correlation: `lam = argmax(|alpha|)`, where `alpha = Xy` initially.
   - Computes `abs(Xy)`: values are [0.88986487, 2.33249979, 0.13957277, 0.21592705, 0.48258954, 0.207901, 0.74100454, 0.06184457, 0.82782566, 1.68362053, 0.0210131, 1.53638069].
   - Maximum is 2.33249979 at index 1.
   - Updates Cholesky factorization, swaps rows/columns of Gram and entries of `Xy` and indices to move selected atom to front.
   - Solves for gamma (coefficient) using Cholesky solver: gamma = Xy[0] / sqrt(Gram[1,1]) = 2.33249979 / 1.0 = 2.33249979.
   - Since `n_active` reaches `max_features` (1), loop stops.
   - Returns `gamma = [2.33249979]`, `indices = [1]`, `n_iter = 1`.
5. The coefficient array of length 12 is created with zeros, and coefficient 2.33249979 is placed at index 1.
6. The result is squeezed to a 1D array (since `Xy` has one column).

Thus, the output is a 12-dimensional vector with a single non-zero coefficient at index 1.
