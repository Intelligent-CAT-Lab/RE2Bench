[THOUGHT]
The function `_get_running_interactive_framework` checks for various GUI frameworks and returns a string indicating which one is running. Given the input, there are no arguments, and the environment state is not specified. The function checks `sys.modules` for Qt, Gtk, wx, tkinter, and macOS backends, and also checks if the display is valid. Since no additional context is provided, we assume none of these GUI frameworks are loaded or running interactively, and the display is valid. Therefore, the function will return `None`.
