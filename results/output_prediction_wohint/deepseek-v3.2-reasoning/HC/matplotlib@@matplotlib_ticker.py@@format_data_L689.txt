[THOUGHT]
The `format_data` method processes the value 0.11 with the given settings. Since `_useLocale` and `_useMathText` are false, formatting is straightforward. The steps:
- Compute exponent `e` as floor(log10(0.11)) = -1.
- Compute significand `s` as round(0.11 / 10^-1, 10) = 1.1.
- Format `s` with '%1.10g' yielding "1.1".
- Format exponent `e` with '%d' yielding "-1".
- Since neither `_useMathText` nor `_usetex` is true, return f'{significand}e{exponent}' = "1.1e-1".
