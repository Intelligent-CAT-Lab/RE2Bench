[THOUGHT]
The function `_mapping_repr` is called with the given input. The mapping is `{"foo": "bar"}`, title is `"Attributes"`, summarizer is an empty dictionary `{}`, and expand_option_name is `"display_expand_attrs"`. However, the summarizer is expected to be a callable function, but an empty dictionary is provided. This would cause a TypeError when the function tries to call the summarizer. But given the context and the title "Attributes", the intended summarizer is likely `summarize_attr`. Proceeding with that assumption, we simulate the function step by step.

1. `col_width` is not provided, so it is calculated by `_calculate_col_width(mapping)`. The mapping has one key "foo" with length 3. The function `_calculate_col_width` computes the maximum name length as 3, then `col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`.

2. `max_rows` is not provided, so it is set to `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. Assuming the default value is 20.

3. The summary list starts with `["Attributes:"]`.

4. The mapping is non-empty with length 1. The function `_get_boolean_with_default("display_expand_attrs", default=True)` is called. Assuming `OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs']` is "default", it returns True. So the condition `not True` is False.

5. Since `len_mapping` (1) is not greater than `max_rows` (20), the else branch is executed.

6. For each item in the mapping, the summarizer is called. With the assumption that the summarizer is `summarize_attr`, for key "foo" and value "bar", with `col_width=13`:
   - `k_str` becomes `"    foo:"`.
   - `pretty_print("    foo:", 13)` returns `"    foo:     "` (8 characters plus 5 spaces to reach 13).
   - `v_str` is `"bar"`.
   - The combined string is `"    foo:      bar"` (with 6 spaces between colon and "bar").
   - `maybe_truncate` with default `OPTIONS['display_width']` (assumed 80) does not truncate.

7. The summary list becomes `["Attributes:", "    foo:      bar"]`.

8. The function returns the joined string with newline: `"Attributes:\n    foo:      bar"`.

Thus, the output is a string representation of the attributes mapping. Since the function returns a string, the output is represented as a JSON object with a key "repr" for the representation string.
