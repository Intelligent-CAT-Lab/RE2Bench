[THOUGHT]
We are given a Mul instance representing pi/2. The Mul has two args: pi and 1/2. Both are nonzero and finite, so their is_zero and is_infinite are False. In _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper, seen_zero and seen_infinite remain False. Then _eval_is_zero returns False because seen_zero is False.

  "is_zero": false
}
