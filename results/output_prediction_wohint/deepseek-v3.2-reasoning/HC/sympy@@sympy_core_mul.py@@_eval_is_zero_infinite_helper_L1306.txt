[THOUGHT]
The `self` input represents a SymPy `Mul` object for the expression `-pi/4`. This expression is a product of `Rational(-1/4)` and `pi`. The method `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` iterates over the arguments of the `Mul` object, checking each argument's `is_zero` and `is_infinite` properties. For `Rational(-1/4)`, both `is_zero` and `is_infinite` are `False`. For `pi`, both are also `False`. The method initializes `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` to `False`. During iteration, since no argument is zero or infinite, and none have ambiguous `is_zero` or `is_infinite` values (`None`), both `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` remain `False`. Therefore, the method returns `(False, False)`.
