[THOUGHT]
The `fit` method of `CheckingClassifier` performs several steps:

1. It validates that `X` and `y` have the same number of samples (150 each), which passes.
2. Since `methods_to_check` is "all", it calls `_check_X_y` with `should_be_fitted=False`. Because `check_X` and `check_y` are `null`, this returns `X` and `y` unchanged.
3. It sets `self.n_features_in_` to the number of features in `X` (4).
4. It computes `self.classes_` by taking the unique values of `y` after validation, resulting in `[0, 1, 2]`.
5. Since `expected_fit_params` is `null`, no check on fit parameters is performed.
6. Since `expected_sample_weight` is `true`, it validates `sample_weight`. The provided `sample_weight` is an array of 150 ones, which passes `_check_sample_weight`.
7. Finally, it returns `self`.

The returned `self` is the instance of `CheckingClassifier` with the added attributes `n_features_in_` and `classes_`. The output should be a JSON representation of the instance's attributes after fitting.
