We are given self = "sqrt(2)", which is a Pow object with base 2 and exponent 1/2. The method as_content_primitive is called with radical=False and clear=False. Following the code:

1. b, e = self.as_base_exp() -> (2, 1/2)
2. b.as_content_primitive(radical=False, clear=False) for Integer 2 returns (2, 1)
3. _keep_coeff(2, 1) with default clear=True returns 2
4. ce, pe = e.as_content_primitive(radical=False, clear=False) for Rational 1/2 returns (1/2, 1)
5. b.is_Rational is True, so enter the if block:
   - h, t = pe.as_coeff_Add() -> (1, 0)
   - ceh = ce * h = 1/2
   - c = self.func(b, ceh) = Pow(2, 1/2) = sqrt(2)
   - sqrt(2) is not Rational, so compute iceh, r = divmod(ceh.p, ceh.q) = divmod(1, 2) -> (0, 1)
   - c = self.func(b, iceh) = Pow(2, 0) = 1
   - t + r/ce/ceh.q = 0 + 1/(1/2)/2 = 1
   - _keep_coeff(ce, 1) = _keep_coeff(1/2, 1) returns 1/2
   - self.func(b, 1/2) = sqrt(2)
6. Return (c, sqrt(2)) = (1, sqrt(2))

Thus, the output is a tuple (1, sqrt(2)). In JSON, we represent this as a list with the integer and the string representation.
