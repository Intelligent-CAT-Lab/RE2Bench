[THOUGHT]
The input provides a quaternion instance with `_real_field: true` and `_norm: null`, but does not specify the components (a, b, c, d). For the method `to_euler` to execute without raising an error, the quaternion must be non-zero. Without explicit components, I assume the simplest non-zero quaternion: (1, 0, 0, 0). This represents no rotation, so the Euler angles for extrinsic "zyz" should be (0, 0, 0). The method `to_euler` is called with `seq="zyz"`, `angle_addition=True`, and `avoid_square_root=False`. With the assumed quaternion, the calculations yield angles (0, 0, 0). The output is a tuple of three SymPy expressions (all 0), which I represent as a JSON array.
