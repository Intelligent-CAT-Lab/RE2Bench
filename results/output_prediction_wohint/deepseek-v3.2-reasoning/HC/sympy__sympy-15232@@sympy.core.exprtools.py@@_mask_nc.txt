Looking at the input, `eq` is provided as a string: `"sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1"`. However, `_mask_nc` expects `eq` to be a SymPy expression, not a string. But from the context, the function likely receives a SymPy expression object. The string representation shows a `sin` function applied to what appears to be a `Sum` object, but with malformed syntax (extra quotes and mismatched parentheses). In practice, if this string were converted to a SymPy expression via `sympify`, it would likely raise an error due to the invalid syntax. However, assuming it's parsed as a valid expression:

1. The expression is `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1` (ignoring the extra quotes and assuming the `Sum` is valid).
2. This expression is entirely commutative because `sin` and `Sum` are commutative operators/functions in SymPy, and there are no non-commutative symbols (like matrices or custom non-commutative objects).
3. According to `_mask_nc`, if `expr.is_commutative` is `True`, it returns `(eq, {}, [])` directly without any substitution.

Thus, the output should be the original expression (unchanged), an empty dictionary, and an empty list.

However, note that the input `eq` is given as a string, but the function would receive it as a SymPy expression after parsing. In the output, the expression is typically returned as a SymPy object, but for JSON serialization, we represent it as a string using its `str` representation.

Given the likely intent, the output will be the original expression string, an empty dict, and an empty list. But to match the function's behavior exactly (where `eq` is a SymPy object), we output the string representation of that object.

Given the malformed input string, if we try to parse it as a SymPy expression literally (with the inner quotes), it would be `sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)") + 1`, which is a `sin` of a string plus 1. This is still commutative because strings are commutative in SymPy. So the result is the same.

Final output: a tuple of (expression string, empty dict, empty list).

[THOUGHT]
1. The input `eq` is a string representing a SymPy expression. It appears malformed but likely intended to be `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1`.
2. This expression is commutative (no non-commutative parts).
3. The function `_mask_nc` checks `expr.is_commutative` and returns `(eq, {}, [])` immediately.
4. So the output is the original expression (as a SymPy object), an empty dictionary, and an empty list.
5. For JSON output, we represent the expression as a string. Given the input string is invalid, we use it as-is, but note that if it were parsed, the representation might differ. However, the function returns the input `eq` unchanged, so we output the same string.

Thus, the output tuple is: `["sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1", {}, []]`.
