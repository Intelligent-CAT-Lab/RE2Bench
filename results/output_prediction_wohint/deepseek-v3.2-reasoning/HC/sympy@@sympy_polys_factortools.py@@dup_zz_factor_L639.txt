[THOUGHT]
The input polynomial f = [1] is a constant polynomial with degree 0. In `dup_zz_factor`, first compute the primitive part using `dup_primitive`: cont = 1, g = [1]. Then n = dup_degree(g) = 0. Since n <= 0, the function returns (cont, []) = (1, []). This holds regardless of the GROUND_TYPES setting, as the flint branch would also yield the same result for a constant polynomial.
