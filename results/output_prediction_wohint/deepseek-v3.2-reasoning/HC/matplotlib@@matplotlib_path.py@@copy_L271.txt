The `copy` method performs a shallow copy of the Path object, resulting in a new Path instance with identical attribute values. Since the original object's arrays are not deep-copied, the new object references the same `_vertices` and `_codes` arrays. The output is a JSON representation of the copied object's state, matching the input structure.

[THOUGHT]
The `copy` method uses `copy.copy(self)`, creating a shallow copy. The new Path object will have the same attributes as the original: `_vertices` and `_codes` remain the same numpy array objects (shared references), while `_interpolation_steps`, `_simplify_threshold`, `_should_simplify`, and `_readonly` are copied as primitive values. Thus, the output JSON mirrors the input's self representation.

```
{
    "_vertices": "array([[0., 0.],\n       [1., 1.]])",
    "_codes": "array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)",

    "_simplify_threshold": 0.1111111111111111,
    "_should_simplify": false,
