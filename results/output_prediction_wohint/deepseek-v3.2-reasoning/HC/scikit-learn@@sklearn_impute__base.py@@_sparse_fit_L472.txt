[THOUGHT]
The function `_sparse_fit` is called with a sparse matrix `X` of shape (4,5) and 20 stored elements, meaning it is dense in sparse format. The strategy is "mean", and `missing_values` is NaN. The `keep_empty_features` attribute is False. The function computes statistics (means) for each column, handling missing values and zeros appropriately.

Given the input, the actual data of `X` is not provided, but the `self.statistics_` array is given as `[3., 2., 5., nan, 2.5]`. This suggests that the test case is set up so that the computed statistics match this array. Specifically:
- Column 0: mean = 3.0
- Column 1: mean = 2.0
- Column 2: mean = 5.0
- Column 3: all values are missing (NaN), so mean = NaN
- Column 4: mean = 2.5

The function returns the `statistics` array, which in this case would be the same as `self.statistics_`. Therefore, the output is the statistics array.
