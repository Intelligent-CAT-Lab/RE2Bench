[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify` processes the input expression `n + n**(-n)`. After sympification, it becomes an `Add` object. The simplification steps include normalization, powsimp, cancel, together, and measure-based selection. The key step is `powsimp(expr, combine='exp', deep=True)`, which rewrites `n**(n+1)` as `n * n**n`, transforming the combined fraction `(n**(n+1) + 1)/n**n` back to `n + n**(-n)`. This form has a lower operation count (`count_ops`) than the fraction, so it is selected as the simplified result. No further simplifications apply, and the final expression remains `n + n**(-n)`.
