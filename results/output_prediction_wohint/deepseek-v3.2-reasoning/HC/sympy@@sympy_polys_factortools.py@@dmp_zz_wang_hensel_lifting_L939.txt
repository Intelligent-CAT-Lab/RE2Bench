The function `dmp_zz_wang_hensel_lifting` performs Hensel lifting for multivariate polynomials over integers. Given the input:
- `f = [[1], [], [-1,0,0]]` (representing \(1 - x^2\) in bivariate form with \(y\) constant),
- `H = [[1,-1], [1,1]]` (univariate factors \(1-x\) and \(1+x\)),
- `LC = [[1], [1]]` (leading coefficients),
- `A = [-1]` (evaluation point),
- `p = 37`,
- `u = 1` (two variables),
- `K = ZZ` (integer domain).

The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Initializes `S = [f]`, `n = 1`, `v = 0`.
2. Skips loop over `reversed(A[1:])` since empty.
3. Computes `d = max(dmp_degree_list(f, 1)[1:]) = 0` (since degree in \(y\) is 0).
4. Enters loop for `j = 2`, `s = f`, `a = -1`.
5. Sets `G = H`, `w = 1`, `I = []`, `J = []`.
6. Updates `H` by converting each univariate factor to bivariate form:
   - For `h = [1, -1]`, `lc = [1]` → `H[0] = [[1], [-1]]`.
   - For `h = [1, 1]`, `lc = [1]` → `H[1] = [[1], [1]]`.
7. Computes `m = [[1,1]]`, `M = [[[1]]]`, `c = dmp_sub(f, dmp_expand(H,1,ZZ),1,ZZ) = 0` (zero polynomial).
8. Since `dj = dmp_degree_in(f, 1, 1) = 0`, the inner loop over `k` is skipped.
9. Checks `dmp_expand(H, 1, ZZ) == f`, so no exception is raised.
10. Returns the updated `H`.

Thus, the output is the list of lifted factors in bivariate representation.
