[THOUGHT]
The function `args_cnc` of `MatMul` is called with `cset=True`. The `self` object is an instance of `MatMul` with no arguments, implying `self.args` is empty. In `as_coeff_matrices`, `scalars` and `matrices` are both empty lists, so `coeff` becomes `Mul()` which evaluates to `1` (the identity). Then `coeff.args_cnc(cset=True)` is called on `1`. Since `1` is not a `Mul`, `Expr.args_cnc` treats it as a single commutative element, resulting in `c=[1]` and `nc=[]`. With `cset=True`, `c` becomes `{1}`, so `coeff_c={1}` and `coeff_nc=[]`. In `MatMul.args_cnc`, since `coeff_c` equals `set([1])`, it is replaced by an empty set. Finally, `coeff_nc + matrices` remains an empty list. The function returns `(set(), [])`.
