[THOUGHT]
We simulate the row reduction step by step. The input matrix is represented as a flat list in row-major order: row0: -9, -17, -19; row1: -10, -18, -17; row2: -21, -38, -40. The function performs Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, but due to parameters normalize=False and zero_above=False, it only eliminates below each pivot and does not normalize pivots to 1. The pivot columns are identified sequentially. After processing column 0, the matrix becomes: row0 unchanged; row1: 0, -8, -37; row2: 0, -15, -39. After processing column 1 (pivot at row1, column1), row2 becomes: 0, 0, -243. Column 2 has a pivot at row2. No row swaps occur. The final matrix is: [-9, -17, -19, 0, -8, -37, 0, 0, -243]. Pivot columns are [0,1,2] and swaps are empty.
