[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the second code snippet step by step.
1. The code reads input as a string. The given input is "9", so n = int("9") = 9.
2. The while loop condition: n % 2 == 0. For n=9, 9 % 2 = 1, so condition false. The loop is not entered.
3. Then it checks if n == 1. Since n is 9, 9 != 1, so the else branch executes, printing "NO".
4. So the output is the string "NO" (followed by a newline, but in the context we just care about the printed text).
Thus, the output is "NO".
