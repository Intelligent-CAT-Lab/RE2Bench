Looking at the code, `as_content_primitive` is a method of the `Expr` class that returns `(S.One, self)` regardless of the arguments `radical` and `clear`.

Given:
- `self` is an object with `nargs = "{1}"`
- `args` are `radical: false, clear: false`
- `kwargs` is empty

The method will simply return a tuple: `(S.One, self)` where:
- `S.One` is a singleton object representing 1
- `self` is the object itself

[THOUGHT]
The method `as_content_primitive` always returns `(S.One, self)` regardless of input arguments. 
Given `self` = `{"nargs": "{1}"}`, the output will be a tuple of `(1, self)`.

Note: In the context of this code, `S.One` is likely a SymPy singleton representing the integer 1.

{
    "tuple": [1, {"nargs": "{1}"}]
