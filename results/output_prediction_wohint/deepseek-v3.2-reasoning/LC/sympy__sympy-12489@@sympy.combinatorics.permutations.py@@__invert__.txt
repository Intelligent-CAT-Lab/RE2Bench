[THOUGHT]
We are given the `__invert__` method of the `Permutation` class. The method returns `self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`. In the input, `self._array_form` is `null` (None) and `self._size` is 5. Without additional context, we assume that when `_array_form` is None, it represents the identity permutation of size 5, which has array form `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The inverse of the identity permutation is itself, so `_af_invert` should return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Then `self._af_new` creates a new permutation with that array form and size 5. The output is a permutation object represented similarly to the input, with updated `_array_form`.
