[THOUGHT]
The `generate_email_pattern` method returns a regex pattern string. It takes no arguments and uses no instance state, so the output is simply the pattern as defined. The pattern is returned as a Python string literal with escaped backslashes, but the actual string value is `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`. When outputting in JSON, backslashes must be escaped, resulting in double backslashes in the JSON string representation.
