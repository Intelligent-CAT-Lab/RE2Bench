Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `add_elements(arr, k)` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns the sum of elements from the first `k` elements of `arr` that have at most 2 digits (i.e., `len(str(elem)) <= 2`).

Given inputs:
- `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `k = 4`

Steps:
1. Take first `k` elements: `arr[:4]` = `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`
2. Filter elements where the length of the string representation is ≤ 2:
   - `str(111)` → "111" (length 3) → exclude
   - `str(21)` → "21" (length 2) → include
   - `str(3)` → "3" (length 1) → include
   - `str(4000)` → "4000" (length 4) → exclude
3. Sum included elements: `21 + 3 = 24`

Thus, the output is `24`.
