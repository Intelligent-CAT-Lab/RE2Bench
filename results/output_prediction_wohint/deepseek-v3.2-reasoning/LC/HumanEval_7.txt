[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `filter_by_substring` that filters a list of strings to only those containing a given substring. The input specifies:
- `strings`: ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- `substring`: "run"

We need to check each string for containment of "run":
- "grunt": contains "run" as the sequence of characters at indices 1-3.
- "trumpet": does not contain "run" because after "ru" comes "m", not "n".
- "prune": contains "run" as indices 1-4.
- "gruesome": does not contain "run" because after "ru" comes "e".

Thus, the filtered list is ["grunt", "prune"].
