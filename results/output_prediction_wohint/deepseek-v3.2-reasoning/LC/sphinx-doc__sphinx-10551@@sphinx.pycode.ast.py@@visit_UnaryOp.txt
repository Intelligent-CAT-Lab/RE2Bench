[THOUGHT]
The function `visit_UnaryOp` is called with a node representing the unary operation `~1`. The node's operator is not an instance of `ast.Not` (it's bitwise invert), so the else branch is taken, returning the concatenation of the string representations of the operator and operand. The operator `~` is represented as the string `"~"`, and the operand `1` as `"1"`, resulting in the string `"~1"`.
