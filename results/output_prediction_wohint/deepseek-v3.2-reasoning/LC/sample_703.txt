[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.
Given inputs: text = "vzzv2sg", char = "z".
Compute char * 2: "zz".
Count occurrences of "zz" in text: text is "vzzv2sg". The substring "zz" appears once (non-overlapping). So count = 1.
Then return text[count:] = text[1:] = "zzv2sg".
Therefore, the output is "zzv2sg".

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "zzv2sg"
}
