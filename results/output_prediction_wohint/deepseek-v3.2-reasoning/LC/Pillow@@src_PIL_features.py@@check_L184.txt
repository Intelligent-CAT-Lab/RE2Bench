[THOUGHT]
The function `check(feature)` is called with `feature="freetype2"`. 
- First, it checks if "freetype2" is in `modules`. In Pillow, "freetype2" is typically not listed as a module; modules are usually names like "PIL.Image" for image format support. Therefore, this condition is false.
- Next, it checks if "freetype2" is in `codecs`. Codecs in Pillow refer to image format encoders/decoders (e.g., "jpg", "png"), and "freetype2" is not a codec, so this condition is false.
- Then, it checks if "freetype2" is in `features`. "freetype2" is a known feature in Pillow for font support, so this condition is true, and it proceeds to call `check_feature("freetype2")`.
- In `check_feature("freetype2")`: 
  - It verifies that "freetype2" is in `features` (no ValueError is raised).
  - It retrieves `module, flag, ver` from `features["freetype2"]`. Typically, for freetype2, this might be `module="PIL._imagingft"`, `flag="HAVE_FREETYPE2"`, and some version info.
  - It attempts to import the module "PIL._imagingft". Assuming Pillow is installed with freetype2 support, the import succeeds.
  - It then accesses `getattr(imported_module, flag)`, which is `HAVE_FREETYPE2`. With freetype2 support, this attribute is likely `True`.
  - Therefore, `check_feature` returns `True`, and thus `check("freetype2")` returns `True`.
