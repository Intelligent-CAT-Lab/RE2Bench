[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `change_base(x=4, base=5)`. The function converts the integer `x` to a string representation in the given base. It does so by repeatedly computing the remainder when dividing by the base, prepending that digit to the result string, and then integer-dividing `x` by the base until `x` becomes zero.

Step-by-step:
- Initialize `ret = ''`.
- `x` is 4, which is greater than 0, so enter the loop.
- Compute `x % base = 4 % 5 = 4`. Convert to string: `'4'`. Prepend to `ret` (which is empty), so `ret = '4'`.
- Update `x = x // base = 4 // 5 = 0`.
- Now `x` is 0, so the loop condition `x > 0` fails.
- Return `ret`, which is `'4'`.

Thus the output is the string "4".
