[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `compare(game, guess)` which returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`. The input provides two lists: `game = [1, 2, 3, 5]` and `guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]`. We need to compute the absolute differences for each pair:

- For the first pair: 1 and -1 → abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(2) = 2
- For the second pair: 2 and 2 → abs(2 - 2) = 0
- For the third pair: 3 and 3 → abs(3 - 3) = 0
- For the fourth pair: 5 and 4 → abs(5 - 4) = 1

Thus, the function returns `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.
