[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.

1. The input to the function `unique` is a list `l` provided in the `args` section: `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`.

2. First, `set(l)` is called. This creates a set from the list, which automatically removes duplicate elements because sets only store unique values.
   - Original list elements: 5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123.
   - After removing duplicates, the set contains: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123. Note that sets are unordered in Python, so the internal order might vary, but the elements are these six unique numbers.

3. Next, `list(set(l))` converts the set back into a list. Since sets are unordered, the resulting list could be in any order, such as `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]` or another permutation.

4. Finally, `sorted(list(set(l)))` sorts this list in ascending order (the default behavior of `sorted()`). Regardless of the initial order from the set, after sorting, the list will always be `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.

5. The function returns this sorted list of unique elements.

The `self` and `kwargs` in the input are empty and do not affect the function execution, as `unique` is a standalone function that only uses the positional argument `l`.

Thus, the output is the sorted list `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
