[THOUGHT]
The input to the `TR111` function is given as a string `"cos(phi)**2"`, which represents a SymPy expression `cos(phi)**2`. This expression is a `Pow` object with base `cos(phi)` and exponent `2`. 

The inner function `f(rv)` in `TR111` checks if `rv` is a `Pow` and if either the base is positive or the exponent is an integer and negative. For `cos(phi)**2`:
- The base `cos(phi)` is not guaranteed to be positive (since `phi` is a symbol), so `rv.base.is_positive` is `False`.
- The exponent `2` is an integer but positive, not negative, so `(rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative)` is `False`.

Thus, the condition in `f(rv)` is not satisfied, and `f(rv)` returns `rv` unchanged. The `bottom_up` traversal applies `f` to the expression tree, but no transformations occur because the condition fails. Therefore, the output of `TR111` is the same as the input: `cos(phi)**2`.

Since the input was provided as a string, the output is also represented as a string for consistency.
