[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code execution step by step.

1. Input is "536870912", so `n = int(input())` gives `n = 536870912`.
2. `x = 1`.
3. Check the while condition: `math.log2(n) % 1`. Compute `math.log2(536870912)`. Since 2^29 = 536870912, the logarithm is exactly 29.0, so `29.0 % 1` equals 0.0, which is falsy. The loop condition is false, so the loop body is not executed.
4. Print `x`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output is 1.
