[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers S and W from input. It prints 'unsafe' if S <= W, otherwise 'safe'. The provided input is given as "\"74 74\"" in JSON, which likely represents the string "74 74" (with quotes). However, this would cause a ValueError when converting to integer due to the quotes. Given typical problem expectations, the intended input is probably "74 74" (without quotes), as the JSON may have escaped the quotes unnecessarily. Assuming the input is "74 74", then S=74 and W=74. Since S <= W is true, the program prints 'unsafe'.
