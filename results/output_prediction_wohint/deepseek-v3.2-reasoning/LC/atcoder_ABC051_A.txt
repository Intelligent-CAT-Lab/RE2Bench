Step by step:
1. The input() function reads the string from standard input. Based on the provided input JSON, the string fed to input() is "\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\"", which in Python is a string that starts and ends with double quotes, containing the text "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc".
2. The code then applies .replace(',', ' ') to this string. This replaces all occurrences of the comma character ',' with a space ' '.
3. In the string "\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\"", there are commas between "avrnc" and "fwujpcm", and between "fwujpcm" and "ggjmc". After replacement, the string becomes "\"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc\"".
4. The print() function outputs this string, so the printed output will be: "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" (including the double quotes).
