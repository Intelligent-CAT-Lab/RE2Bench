[THOUGHT]
The method `clean_non_binary_chars` modifies `self.binary_string` in place by filtering out any characters not in '01'. Since the input string `"01101000011011010110001001101111"` consists only of '0' and '1', it remains unchanged. The method does not have a return statement, so it returns `None` by default. Therefore, the output of the method call is `None`.
