[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the `simplify` function step by step using the provided inputs.

Given:
- x = "7/2"
- n = "4/2"

Steps:
1. Split x by '/': a, b = "7/2".split('/') → a = "7", b = "2"
2. Split n by '/': c, d = "4/2".split('/') → c = "4", d = "2"
3. Convert to integers and compute numerator: numerator = int(a) * int(c) = 7 * 4 = 28
4. Convert to integers and compute denominator: denom = int(b) * int(d) = 2 * 2 = 4
5. Calculate numerator / denom = 28 / 4 = 7.0
6. Calculate int(numerator / denom) = int(7.0) = 7
7. Check if numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom): 7.0 == 7 → True (since they are numerically equal in Python)
8. The condition is True, so the function returns True.

Thus, the output is True.
