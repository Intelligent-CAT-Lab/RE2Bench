[THOUGHT]
The function `_new` is a class method that creates an instance of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`. Given the input, `iterable` appears to be a 2x2 matrix (likely a SymPy Matrix) with unspecified elements. Since `_mat` is null, I assume the matrix is a zero matrix, resulting in a flat list of four zeros. The shape is inferred as (2, 2). The method constructs an instance with attributes `_shape`, `_array`, `_rank`, and `_loop_size`. The output should represent the internal state of the returned instance.

```
{
    "_shape": [2, 2],
    "_array": [0, 0, 0, 0],
    "_rank": 2,
    "_loop_size": 4
}
