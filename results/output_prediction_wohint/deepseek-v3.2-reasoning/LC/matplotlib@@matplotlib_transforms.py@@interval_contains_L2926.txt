Looking at the input, the `interval` parameter is provided as a string representation of a numpy array: `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"`. However, the function expects `interval` to be a tuple or list that can be unpacked into two values.

Given that the input is a string, the function `interval_contains` will attempt to unpack this string as if it were a sequence of two elements. When Python tries to unpack the string `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"` into two variables, it will treat each character as an element. Since the string has 41 characters, this will raise a ValueError because there are too many values to unpack.

Therefore, the function will raise an exception rather than return a result.

[THOUGHT]
The input provides `interval` as a string `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"`. The function `interval_contains` expects a tuple/list with exactly two elements. When the function attempts `a, b = interval`, it will try to unpack each character of the string into `a` and `b`, but the string has 41 characters, causing a ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2).

Error: ValueError - too many values to unpack (expected 2)
