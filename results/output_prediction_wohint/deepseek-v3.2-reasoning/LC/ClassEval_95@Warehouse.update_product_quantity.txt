[THOUGHT]
We are given the `Warehouse` class and its `update_product_quantity` method. The method updates the quantity of a product if the product_id exists in the inventory. In the provided input, `self.inventory` has a key "1" (string), but `product_id` is given as 1 (integer). Since dictionary keys are type-sensitive, `1 in self.inventory` evaluates to False because the inventory dictionary does not have an integer key 1; it has a string key "1". Therefore, the condition inside the method fails, no update occurs, and the method returns None (as there is no explicit return statement). Thus, the output of the function call is None.
