[THOUGHT]
We are given the `DocFileHandler.add_heading` method. The input specifies `self.file_path = "test_example.docx"` and `heading = "Test Heading 5"`. The method tries to open an existing Word document at that path using `Document(self.file_path)`. If the file does not exist, `Document()` will raise an exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`). The method catches any exception and returns `False`. If the file exists and the operation succeeds, it returns `True`.

Since no information is provided about the existence of "test_example.docx", and the code does not create a new document if it doesn't exist, it is most likely that the file does not exist. Therefore, the method will raise an exception, catch it, and return `False`.

Thus, the output is `False`.
