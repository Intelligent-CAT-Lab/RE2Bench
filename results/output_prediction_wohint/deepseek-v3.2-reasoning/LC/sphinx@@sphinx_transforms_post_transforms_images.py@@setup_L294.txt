Looking at the provided code and input, I need to analyze what the `setup` function does and predict its output.

The `setup` function:
1. Takes an `app` parameter (a Sphinx application instance)
2. Calls `app.add_post_transform()` twice with two different transform classes
3. Returns a dictionary with version info and parallel safety flags

Given the input shows `app` is a SphinxTestApp instance, but I don't have the actual objects for `ImageDownloader` and `DataURIExtractor`. However, the key insight is that the function's return value is completely independent of the input - it always returns the same hardcoded dictionary regardless of what `app` is or what `add_post_transform` does.

[THOUGHT]
1. The `setup` function is called with a Sphinx app instance as argument
2. It calls `app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader)` - this registers a transform but doesn't affect return value
3. It calls `app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor)` - same as above
4. It returns a fixed dictionary: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`
5. The input parameters don't affect the return value at all

Therefore, the output will always be the same dictionary regardless of the input.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
