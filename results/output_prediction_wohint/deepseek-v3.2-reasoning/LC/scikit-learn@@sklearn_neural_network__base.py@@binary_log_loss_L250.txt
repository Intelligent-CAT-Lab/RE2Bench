[THOUGHT]
The function binary_log_loss computes the binary cross-entropy loss. Given the inputs, we parse y_true and y_prob as numpy arrays. y_true is a 73x3 boolean array, and y_prob is a 73x3 float array. The steps are:
1. Determine eps for float64 (approx 2.22e-16).
2. Clip y_prob to [eps, 1-eps] to avoid log(0) or log(1).
3. Compute xlogy(y_true, y_prob) + xlogy(1-y_true, 1-y_prob) element-wise, which gives the negative per-sample per-class log loss.
4. Average over rows (axis=0) to get per-column mean negative log loss.
5. Sum these per-column averages and take the negative to obtain the final positive loss.
Given the large number of samples, exact manual computation is infeasible. However, sampling several rows suggests the average per-row total loss is around 4.0. Therefore, the output is approximately 4.0.
