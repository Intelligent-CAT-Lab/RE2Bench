[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `maximum(arr, k)`. The input provides `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`. Let's simulate the execution:
1. Check if `k == 0`: `k` is 2, so condition is false.
2. `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order. The array is already sorted as `[-4, 4]`, so it remains `[-4, 4]`.
3. `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements. Since `k = 2` and the array has two elements, `arr[-2:]` returns the entire list: `[-4, 4]`.
4. The function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.
