[THOUGHT]
The function `remove_vowels` iterates over each character in the input string and includes it in the result only if its lowercase version is not in the list of vowels `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`. The input string is `"abcdef\nghijklm"`. Processing character by character:
- 'a' (vowel) → exclude
- 'b' → include
- 'c' → include
- 'd' → include
- 'e' (vowel) → exclude
- 'f' → include
- '\n' (newline, not a vowel) → include
- 'g' → include
- 'h' → include
- 'i' (vowel) → exclude
- 'j' → include
- 'k' → include
- 'l' → include
- 'm' → include
The resulting string is `"bcdf\nghjklm"`.
