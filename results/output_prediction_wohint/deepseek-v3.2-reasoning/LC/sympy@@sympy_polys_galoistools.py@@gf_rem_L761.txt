[THOUGHT]
The function `gf_rem` computes the remainder of polynomial division in GF(p). Given inputs f = [2, 0], g = [1, 0, 1], p = 3, and K = "ZZ" (integer domain), we first check the degrees: degree(f) = 1, degree(g) = 2. Since degree(f) < degree(g), the division algorithm returns quotient [] and remainder f. Thus the remainder is [2, 0]. No further computation is needed.
