[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `get_positive(l: list)`. It takes a list `l` and returns a new list containing only the elements that are greater than 0. The input specifies that the argument `l` is `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`. 

Step-by-step:
- The function iterates through each element in `l`.
- It checks if the element is positive (greater than 0).
- The positive elements are 4, 5, and 6.
- Therefore, the function returns `[4, 5, 6]`.

The output should be a JSON object with the key "output" set to this list.
