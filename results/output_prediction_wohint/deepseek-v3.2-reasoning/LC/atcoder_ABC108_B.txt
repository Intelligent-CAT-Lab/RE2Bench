First, I need to extract the input string from the provided JSON input. The JSON is `{ "input": "\"100 100 100 99\"" }`, which when parsed, gives the input string as `"100 100 100 99"` including the double quotes. However, this would cause issues when splitting and converting to integers, as `int('"100')` would raise a ValueError. Given the context of the code—reading four integers for coordinates—and the first example where the input string was used directly, I suspect there might be a formatting error in the JSON representation. Therefore, I will assume the intended input string is "100 100 100 99" without the enclosing quotes, similar to the first case. This allows the code to execute properly.

Proceeding with the simulation:
1. `input()` returns the string "100 100 100 99".
2. `.split()` splits the string by whitespace, resulting in the list `['100', '100', '100', '99']`.
3. `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer, so `x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 100, y2 = 99`.
4. Calculate `a = x2 - x1 = 100 - 100 = 0`.
5. Calculate `b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1`.
6. The `print` statement computes:
   - `x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99`
   - `x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100`
7. The output printed will be "101 99 101 100" (as print separates arguments by spaces).

Thus, the expected output is the string "101 99 101 100".
