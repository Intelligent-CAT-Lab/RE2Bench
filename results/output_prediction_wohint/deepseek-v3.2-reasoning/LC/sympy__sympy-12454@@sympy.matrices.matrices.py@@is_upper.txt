[THOUGHT]
The property `is_upper` checks if the matrix is upper triangular by verifying that all elements below the main diagonal are zero. Given the input has `rows=4`, `cols=4`, and `_mat=null`, we assume the matrix is uninitialized. However, in typical matrix implementations (like SymPy's Matrix), if no data is provided, the matrix defaults to zeros. For a 4x4 zero matrix, all elements are zero. The iteration in `is_upper` covers indices i from 1 to 3 and j from 0 to i-1, all of which are zero. Thus, `self[i, j].is_zero` returns True for each, and `all(...)` returns True. Therefore, `is_upper` returns True.
