The function `_make_subclass` creates a new class dynamically using `type()` with specified attributes.

Given the inputs:
- name = "secret"
- module = "unknown"
- superclass = `_MockObject` (default, not provided so uses this)
- attributes = None (default)
- decorator_args = () (default)

The attrs dict will be:
{
    '__module__': 'unknown',
    '__display_name__': 'unknown.secret',
    '__name__': 'secret',
    '__sphinx_decorator_args__': ()
}

The function returns: `type(name, (superclass,), attrs)`

Since `_MockObject` isn't defined in the provided code, I'll assume it's some existing class from the context. The output will be a new class object with the name "secret" that inherits from `_MockObject`.

However, since the output needs to be JSON-serializable, and we can't serialize a class object directly, I'll represent it as the class creation expression.

[THOUGHT]
The function `_make_subclass` creates a new class dynamically. With the given inputs:
- name: "secret"
- module: "unknown"
- superclass defaults to `_MockObject` (not in provided code but assumed available)
- attributes defaults to None
- decorator_args defaults to ()

It will create a class named "secret" inheriting from `_MockObject` with the module set to "unknown" and additional attributes as specified.

The return value is a class object, which isn't JSON-serializable. For output, I'll describe what was created.

However, looking at how such outputs are typically represented in this type of exercise, and considering the first example returned a string path, I should return a string representation or the attributes.

Given the context, the class would be represented by its display name: 'unknown.secret'

Alternatively, I could return the class dictionary structure, but that might not match the expected output format.

Since the function returns a class object and the exercise asks for the output of the function, and considering this is a simulated execution, I'll output the class's display name string.
