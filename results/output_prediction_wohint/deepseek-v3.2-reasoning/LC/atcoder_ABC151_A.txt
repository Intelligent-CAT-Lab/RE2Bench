[THOUGHT]
The code snippet `print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))` reads a string from standard input, computes its Unicode code point, adds 1, and prints the character corresponding to the new code point. The input JSON has `"input": "\"a\""`, which when parsed gives the string `'"a"'` (including double quotes). This string has length 3, so `ord()` would raise a `TypeError` because it requires a single character. However, given the simplicity of the code and common practice, it's more likely that the intended input is a single character `'a'`. Interpreting the input as `"a"` (string of length 1), `ord('a')` is 97, adding 1 yields 98, and `chr(98)` is `'b'`. Thus, the output is `'b'`.
