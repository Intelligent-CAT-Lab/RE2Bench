[THOUGHT]
The function `change_order_status` checks if `order_id` exists in `self.orders`. In the input, `self.orders` has a key of string `"1"`, while the provided `order_id` argument is an integer `1`. Since `1` (integer) is not equal to `"1"` (string), the condition `if order_id in self.orders` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the else branch executes and returns `False`. No change is made to `self.orders`.
