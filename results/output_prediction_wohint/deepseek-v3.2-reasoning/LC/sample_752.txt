[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f(s, amount) that returns a string. The steps:
1. Compute len(s): for s = "abc", len(s) = 3.
2. Compute amount - len(s): 8 - 3 = 5.
3. Multiply the string 'z' by that number: 5 * 'z' = 'zzzzz'.
4. Concatenate the result with s: 'zzzzz' + "abc" = "zzzzzabc".
5. Return that string. So the output is "zzzzzabc".
