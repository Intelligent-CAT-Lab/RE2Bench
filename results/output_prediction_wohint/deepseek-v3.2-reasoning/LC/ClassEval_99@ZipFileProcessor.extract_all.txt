[THOUGHT]
The method `extract_all` attempts to open a zip file with the name from `self.file_name` (which is an empty string) and extract its contents to `output_path` (also an empty string). Opening a zip file with an empty string as the filename will raise an exception, causing the bare `except` block to execute and return `False`.
