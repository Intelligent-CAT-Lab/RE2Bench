[THOUGHT]
The function `get_encodings_from_content` searches for character encodings in the provided HTML/XML content string using three regular expressions. The input content is `<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">`. 

- `charset_re` looks for `charset=` anywhere after `<meta`, capturing the value. It matches `charset=UTF-8` and captures "UTF-8".
- `pragma_re` looks for `content="...;charset=..."`, capturing the charset value. It also matches and captures "UTF-8".
- `xml_re` looks for an XML declaration, which doesn't match.

The function returns the concatenated list of matches from all three regexes, resulting in `["UTF-8", "UTF-8"]`. A deprecation warning is issued but doesn't affect the return value.
