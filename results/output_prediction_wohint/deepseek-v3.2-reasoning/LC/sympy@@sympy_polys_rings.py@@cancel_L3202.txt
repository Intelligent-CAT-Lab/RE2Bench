[THOUGHT]
The function `cancel` is called with `self` being the zero polynomial (empty dict) and `g` being the constant polynomial 1. The condition `if not f:` (where `f` is `self`) evaluates to true because `self` is the zero polynomial. The function immediately returns `(f, ring.one)`, which is the zero polynomial and the constant polynomial 1. Therefore, the output is a tuple of two polynomials: an empty polynomial (zero) and the polynomial with monomial (0,0,0,0) and coefficient 1.
