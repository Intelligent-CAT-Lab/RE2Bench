Looking at the provided code and input, I need to analyze what the `visit_BinOp` method would return given the AST node for `int | None`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The input represents an AST node for a binary operation (`BinOp`) where:
   - `left` is an `ast.Name` node with `id="int"`
   - `op` appears to be empty or unspecified (likely representing the `|` union operator)
   - `right` is what appears to be an `ast.Constant` node with `value=null` (None)

2. Looking at the `visit_BinOp` method logic:
   - First checks if `node.op` is an instance of `ast.Pow` (power/`**` operator)
   - If yes: returns concatenated string without spaces
   - If no: returns space-joined string of left, op, and right

3. In Python's AST, the `|` operator for type unions is typically represented as `ast.BitOr` (not `ast.Pow`)
   - Therefore `isinstance(node.op, ast.Pow)` will be `False`
   - The code will take the else branch

4. The method calls `self.visit()` on each element:
   - `self.visit(node.left)` would produce `"int"` (visiting a Name node)
   - `self.visit(node.op)` would need to produce `"|"` (visiting a BitOr node)
   - `self.visit(node.right)` would produce `"None"` (visiting a Constant/NameConstant node)

5. The three parts are joined with spaces: `"int | None"`

6. However, looking more carefully at the input structure:
   - The `op` field is an empty dictionary `{}`, which might be problematic
   - This suggests the actual operator type isn't properly specified in the input
   - But based on context (the union operator in type annotation), it should be `|`

7. Given the context of the original code string `"def \"func(age: int | None)\": pass"`, the binary operation is `int | None`

"int | None"
