[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums`, an index `idx`, and a value `added`. It performs slice assignment `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)`. This inserts `added` at position `idx` in the list, shifting existing elements to the right. Given `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, `idx = 2`, and `added = 3`, we insert `3` at index 2. The original element at index 2 (which is 3) moves to index 3, and all subsequent elements shift right. The resulting list is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`. The function returns this modified list.
