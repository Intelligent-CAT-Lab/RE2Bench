[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer N from input. The input is "99", so N = 99.
Since N is odd (99 % 2 == 1), the else branch is executed.
Compute (N + 1) / N / 2 = (99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2.
In Python, division yields a float: 100 / 99 ≈ 1.0101010101010102, then divided by 2 gives approximately 0.5050505050505051.
So the output printed is 0.5050505050505051.
