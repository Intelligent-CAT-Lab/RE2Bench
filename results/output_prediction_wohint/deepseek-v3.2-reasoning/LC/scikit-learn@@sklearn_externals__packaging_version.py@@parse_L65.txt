[THOUGHT]
1. The `parse` function is called with the argument `version` set to "1.11.3".
2. Inside `parse`, it attempts to create a `Version` object by calling `Version("1.11.3")`.
3. In `Version.__init__`, a regex search is performed on the string "1.11.3". Based on the standard version parsing regex (PEP 440 compatible), "1.11.3" matches as a release version without epoch, pre-release, post-release, developmental release, or local version segments.
4. The match groups are extracted:
   - `epoch` is None or defaults to 0.
   - `release` is "1.11.3", which is split into the tuple (1, 11, 3).
   - `pre`, `post`, `dev`, and `local` are all None since no corresponding parts are present in the version string.
5. A `_Version` object is instantiated with `epoch=0`, `release=(1, 11, 3)`, `pre=None`, `post=None`, `dev=None`, and `local=None`.
6. The `_key` attribute is generated for sorting purposes, but no exception is raised during this process.
7. Therefore, `Version("1.11.3")` is successfully created, and `parse` returns this `Version` object.
8. The `Version` object typically has a string representation that returns the normalized version string, which in this case is "1.11.3" or an equivalent form. Since the input is already standard, the output can be represented as the version string.
