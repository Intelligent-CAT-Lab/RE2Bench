[THOUGHT]
The function `__pow__` takes an integer exponent `n` and raises the permutation to that power. The input `self` represents a permutation with `_array_form` and `_cyclic_form` both `null`, and `_size` 7. This likely corresponds to the identity permutation of size 7, whose array form is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Raising the identity to any power, including -2, yields the identity permutation. The `__pow__` method computes the power using `_af_pow` on the array form and returns a new permutation via `_af_new`. The result will have array form `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The output is expected to be a JSON representation of the result, likely focusing on the array form since it is directly computed.
