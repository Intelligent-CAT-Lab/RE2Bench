[THOUGHT]
The function `remove_item` modifies the `self.items` dictionary by decrementing the quantity of the specified item. However, it does not have a `return` statement, meaning it implicitly returns `None`. The input specifies that `item` is "apple" and `quantity` defaults to 1, so the quantity of "apple" decreases from 4 to 3. But the output of the function call is `None`.
