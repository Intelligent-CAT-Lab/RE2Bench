[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the skewness of the data [1, 1, 1].

1. `n = len(data)` = 3.
2. `mean = sum(data) / n` = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.
3. `variance = sum(((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data)) / n`:
   Each term (1 - 1)^2 = 0, so variance = 0.
4. `std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)` = 0.
5. Since `std_deviation` is 0, the condition `if std_deviation != 0` is false, so `skewness` is set to 0.

Thus, the output is 0.
