[THOUGHT]
The function `_coeff_isneg` takes a SymPy expression `a` and attempts to determine if its leading coefficient is negative. For the input `a = "cos(2*phi)/2"`, which SymPy interprets as `cos(2*phi) * 0.5` (a multiplication), the following steps occur:
- `a.is_MatMul` is False (it's not a matrix multiplication).
- `a.is_Mul` is True (it's a multiplication expression).
- Since `a.is_Mul` is True, `a` is reassigned to `a.args[0]`. In SymPy, the arguments of a `Mul` are ordered canonically, typically with numeric coefficients first, so `a.args[0]` is `0.5` (a rational number).
- The function then returns `a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative`. Here, `0.5` is a number but not negative, so the result is `False`.
