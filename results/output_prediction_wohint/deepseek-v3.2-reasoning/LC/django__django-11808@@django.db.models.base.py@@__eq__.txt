[THOUGHT]
We are to evaluate the `__eq__` method of a Django Model. The input provides two objects, `self` and `other`, with identical attributes including `id`=1. We assume they are instances of the same concrete model (since no information to the contrary). The method checks that `other` is a Model (we assume it is), then checks the concrete models (we assume they are equal), then gets the primary key. Since both have `id`=1, `self.pk` and `other.pk` are 1. Then the method returns `True` because 1 == 1.
