[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method compares `self` with `other`. Here, `other` is a string: "_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')". Since `isinstance(other, str)` is True, the method issues a deprecation warning and returns `self.__str__() == other`. The `self` parameter is given as an empty dictionary in the input, which likely indicates that `self` is an instance of `_StrPath` with no special attributes, so its string representation is the current directory (`.`). Therefore, comparing `'.'` with the given string results in False. Thus, the output is `false`.
