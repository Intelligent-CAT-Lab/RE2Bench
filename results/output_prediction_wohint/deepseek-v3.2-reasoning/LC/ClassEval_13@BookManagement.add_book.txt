[THOUGHT]
The `add_book` method modifies the inventory by adding the specified quantity to an existing book title. In this case, the title "book2" is already present in the inventory with a quantity of 1. Since no quantity is provided, it defaults to 1, so the quantity for "book2" becomes 2. However, the method does not have a return statement, meaning it implicitly returns `None`. Therefore, the output of the function call is `None`.
