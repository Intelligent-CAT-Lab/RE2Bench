[THOUGHT]
The function TR6 calls _TR56 with f=cos, g=sin, h=lambda x: 1-x. The input rv is the string "cos(phi)", but in context it represents a SymPy expression cos(phi). Since cos(phi) is not a power (i.e., not of the form cos(phi)**n), the condition in _TR56's helper function _f checks if rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f. This condition fails, so _f returns rv unchanged. The bottom_up traversal does not modify the expression. Therefore, the output is the same as the input: cos(phi).
