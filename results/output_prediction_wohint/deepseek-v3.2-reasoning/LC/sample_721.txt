[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f with nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
First, count = len(nums) = 5.
Then, the loop iterates over num in range(2, 5), which yields values 2, 3, and 4. For each iteration, it calls nums.sort(), which sorts the list in ascending order in place.
The initial list is already sorted in ascending order: -8 < -7 < -6 < -5 < 2. Thus, each sort operation does not change the order.
After three sorts, the list remains the same.
The function returns nums, which is still [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
