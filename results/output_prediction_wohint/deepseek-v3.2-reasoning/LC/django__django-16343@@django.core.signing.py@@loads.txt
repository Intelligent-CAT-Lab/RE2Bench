[THOUGHT]
The function `loads` is designed to decode and verify a signed string using Django's signing utilities. The input string `s` is in the format `<base64_data>:<timestamp>:<signature>`. The function uses `TimestampSigner` to unsign the string, which involves:
1. Splitting the string into its three components.
2. Verifying the signature using the provided key and salt (defaults are used here).
3. Decoding the base64-encoded data part, which is expected to be JSON.
4. Returning the deserialized JSON object.

The first part of the string, `eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9`, is base64-encoded JSON. Decoding it yields `{"a":"dictionary"}`. The remaining parts are the timestamp and signature for validation. Since no `max_age` is provided in the input, the timestamp is not checked for expiration. Assuming the signature is valid (which it should be for a correctly signed string), the function will return the decoded dictionary.

Thus, the output of `loads` is the Python dictionary `{"a": "dictionary"}`.
