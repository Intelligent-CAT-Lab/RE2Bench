The `f1_score` function with `average='micro'` calculates the micro-averaged F1 score, which is equivalent to accuracy in a multiclass setting. The accuracy is computed as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

Given the input arrays:
- `y_true` and `y_pred` are converted from the provided strings into lists of integers.
- There are 75 predictions in total.
- The number of correct predictions (where `y_true[i] == y_pred[i]`) is 40.

Thus, the micro-averaged F1 score is \( \frac{40}{75} = 0.5333333333333333 \).
