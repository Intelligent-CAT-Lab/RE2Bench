[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution:

1. The VendingMachine instance `self` has an inventory dictionary containing one item: "Coke" with price 1.25 and quantity 10.
2. The method `restock_item` is called with `item_name="Pizza"` and `quantity=10`.
3. The method checks if "Pizza" exists in `self.inventory`. Currently, only "Coke" exists.
4. Since "Pizza" is not in the inventory, the condition `if item_name in self.inventory` evaluates to False.
5. The else branch executes: `return False`.
6. Therefore, the output is False.
