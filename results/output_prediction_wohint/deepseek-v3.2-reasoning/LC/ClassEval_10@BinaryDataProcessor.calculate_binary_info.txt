[THOUGHT]
We are given a BinaryDataProcessor instance with binary_string = "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111". The method `calculate_binary_info` computes the percentage of zeros and ones, and the total bit length. Since the string contains only '0' and '1', the `clean_non_binary_chars` method (called in __init__) will not change it. We count the zeros and ones: the string length is 40. There are 19 zeros and 21 ones. Thus, zeroes_percentage = 19/40 = 0.475, ones_percentage = 21/40 = 0.525. The output dictionary will be {'Zeroes': 0.475, 'Ones': 0.525, 'Bit length': 40}.
