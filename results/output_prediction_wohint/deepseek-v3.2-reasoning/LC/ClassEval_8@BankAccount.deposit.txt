[THOUGHT]
We are given a class BankAccount with a method deposit. The input specifies that the instance has balance=0, and the deposit method is called with amount=300. The method checks if amount is negative; since 300 >= 0, it proceeds to add amount to self.balance, making it 300. It then returns self.balance, which is 300. Therefore, the output is 300.
