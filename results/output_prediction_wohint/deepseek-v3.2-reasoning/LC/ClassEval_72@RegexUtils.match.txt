[THOUGHT]
The `match` method uses `re.match` to check if the pattern matches at the beginning of the text. The pattern is for email addresses and requires an "@" symbol. The provided text "iustd87t2euhifg.com" lacks an "@", so it does not match. Therefore, `re.match` returns `None`, and the method returns `False`.
