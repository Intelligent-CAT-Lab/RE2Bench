[THOUGHT]
1. The function `precision_recall_curve` is called with arguments: `y_true=None`, `probas_pred=None`, `pos_label=1`, `sample_weight=None`.

2. Inside `precision_recall_curve`, it calls `_binary_clf_curve(y_true=None, y_score=None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None)`.

3. `_binary_clf_curve` starts by calling `type_of_target(y_true=None)` to determine the type of `y_true`.

4. `type_of_target` checks if `y_true` is valid: `None` is not a `Sequence`, not a sparse matrix, does not have the `__array__` attribute, and is not a string. Therefore, the validity check fails.

5. `type_of_target` raises a `ValueError` with the message: "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None".

6. This `ValueError` is not caught within `_binary_clf_curve` or `precision_recall_curve`, so it propagates out, causing the function call to terminate with an exception.

7. As a result, `precision_recall_curve` does not return any value; instead, it raises a `ValueError`.
