[THOUGHT]
The `subtract` method expects two complex numbers. The input JSON provides `c1` and `c2` as strings representing complex numbers, but in the actual function call, they would be passed as complex numbers. Interpreting them as such:
- c1 = -1 + 2j
- c2 = -3 + 4j
Subtraction: real part = (-1) - (-3) = 2, imaginary part = 2 - 4 = -2.
Result: 2 - 2j, which Python represents as `(2-2j)`.
