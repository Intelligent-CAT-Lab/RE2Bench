[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text, ch)` simply returns the count of occurrences of the character `ch` in the string `text`. Given the inputs: text = "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!" and ch = " ", we need to count the number of spaces in the string. Examining the string: "This" (space) "be" (space) "Pirate's" (space) "Speak" (space) "for" (space) "'help'!". There are exactly 5 spaces. So the function returns 5.
