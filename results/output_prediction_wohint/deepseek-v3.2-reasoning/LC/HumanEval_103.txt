Let's execute the function step by step with n=185 and m=546.

1. Check if m < n: 546 < 185 is false, so we do not return -1.
2. Initialize summation = 0.
3. Loop i from n to m inclusive: i = 185 to 546.
4. Compute summation = sum of integers from 185 to 546.
   - Number of terms = m - n + 1 = 546 - 185 + 1 = 362.
   - Sum = (first + last) * number_of_terms / 2 = (185 + 546) * 362 / 2 = 731 * 362 / 2.
   - 731 * 362 = 264,622. Then divide by 2: 132,311.
5. Compute average = summation / (m - n + 1) = 132,311 / 362 = 365.5 exactly.
6. Round the average: round(365.5). In Python, round uses "round half to even". Since 365.5 is exactly halfway and 365 is odd, it rounds to the nearest even integer, which is 366.
7. Convert to binary using bin(): bin(366) returns the string '0b101101110'.
8. The function returns this string.

Thus, the output is "0b101101110".
