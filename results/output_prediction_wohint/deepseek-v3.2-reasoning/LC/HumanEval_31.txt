[THOUGHT]
We need to determine if 13441 is prime. The function `is_prime` checks if `n` is less than 2, then iterates from 2 to `n-2` (inclusive) to see if any integer divides `n`. If a divisor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. For `n = 13441`, we can verify primality by checking divisibility by primes up to the square root of 13441 (approximately 115.98). Testing small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113) shows none divide 13441. Therefore, 13441 is prime, and the function will return `True`.
