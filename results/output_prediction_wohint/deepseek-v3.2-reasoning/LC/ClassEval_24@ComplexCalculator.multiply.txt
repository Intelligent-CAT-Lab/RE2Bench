[THOUGHT]
The function `ComplexCalculator.multiply` is a static method that multiplies two complex numbers. Given inputs `c1 = (-1-2j)` and `c2 = (-3-4j)` as strings, we interpret them as complex numbers. The real and imaginary parts are extracted: c1.real = -1, c1.imag = -2; c2.real = -3, c2.imag = -4. Then:
real = (-1)*(-3) - (-2)*(-4) = 3 - 8 = -5
imaginary = (-1)*(-4) + (-2)*(-3) = 4 + 6 = 10
The result is complex(-5, 10), which in Python is represented as (-5+10j).
