The `predict_binned` method uses the tree nodes to traverse from the root to a leaf for each sample in `X`, using the binned feature values and thresholds. The nodes are a structured array with fields including `feature_idx`, `bin_threshold`, `left`, `right`, and `is_leaf`. For each sample, we start at node 0 and follow the splits based on the feature value compared to the bin threshold (if value <= threshold, go to left child, else right) until reaching a leaf node, where the prediction is the node's `value` field. 

Given the input data:
- `X` is a 5x100 array of uint8 values (5 samples, 100 features).
- `missing_values_bin_idx` is 255, but no feature values equal 255, so missing handling is not invoked.
- The tree has 13 nodes, with leaf nodes at indices 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Traversing for each sample:
- Sample 0: Node0 (feature 6=9 <=38) → Node1 (feature 62=15 <=37) → Node2 (feature 88=36 >26) → Node8 (feature 1=33 >20) → Node10 (leaf, value=-3.2169443).
- Sample 1: Node0 (feature 6=37 <=38) → Node1 (feature 62=32 <=37) → Node2 (feature 88=39 >26) → Node8 (feature 1=41 >20) → Node10 (leaf, value=-3.2169443).
- Sample 2: Node0 (feature 6=21 <=38) → Node1 (feature 62=36 <=37) → Node2 (feature 88=4 <=26) → Node3 (feature 99=7 <=13) → Node4 (leaf, value=1.74244938).
- Sample 3: Node0 (feature 6=3 <=38) → Node1 (feature 62=25 <=37) → Node2 (feature 88=43 >26) → Node8 (feature 1=10 <=20) → Node9 (leaf, value=8.8096566).
- Sample 4: Node0 (feature 6=41 >38) → Node12 (leaf, value=14.6135011).

Thus, the output array is [-3.2169443, -3.2169443, 1.74244938, 8.8096566, 14.6135011], with dtype likely float64 (Y_DTYPE).
