[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` (a list) and `p` (an integer).
2. Compute `prev_p = p - 1`. Given `p = 6`, so `prev_p = 5`.
3. Check if `prev_p < 0`. Since `5` is not less than `0`, the condition is false, so `prev_p` remains `5`.
4. Return `nums[prev_p]`, which is `nums[5]`.
5. The list `nums` is `[6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]`. Index `5` corresponds to the value `1`.
Thus, the output is `1`.
