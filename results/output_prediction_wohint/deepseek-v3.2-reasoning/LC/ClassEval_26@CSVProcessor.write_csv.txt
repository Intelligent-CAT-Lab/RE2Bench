[THOUGHT]
We are given the CSVProcessor class with a write_csv method. The method attempts to write the provided data to the specified file. It returns 1 on success and 0 on any exception. The input data is a list of two rows: ["a", "b", "c", "d"] and ["ME"]. The file name is "read_test_process.csv". There's no indication of any issue (like permission errors or invalid file paths), so the write should succeed. The method will open the file, write the rows, and return 1.
