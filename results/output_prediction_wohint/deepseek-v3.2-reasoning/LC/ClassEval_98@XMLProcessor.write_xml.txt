[THOUGHT]
The `write_xml` method attempts to create an `ElementTree` with `self.root` (which is `None`) and then write it to a file with the given name (empty string). Creating an `ElementTree` with `None` may be allowed, but writing to an empty file name will raise an exception (e.g., `OSError`). Since the method has a bare `except` clause, any exception will be caught, and the method will return `False`. Therefore, the output is `False`.
