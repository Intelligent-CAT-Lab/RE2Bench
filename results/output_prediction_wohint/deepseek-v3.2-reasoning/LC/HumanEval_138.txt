[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` is defined to take one argument `n`.

2. From the input JSON, the value for `n` is provided in "args": {"n": 10}. The "self": {} and "kwargs": {} are not used by the function, so we ignore them.

3. Evaluate the function call with `n = 10`.

4. First part: `n % 2 == 0`. Compute `10 % 2`, which is 0, so `0 == 0` is True.

5. Second part: `n >= 8`. Since 10 is greater than 8, this is True.

6. The return statement is `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`, which is True and True, resulting in True.

7. Therefore, the output of the function is the boolean value True.
