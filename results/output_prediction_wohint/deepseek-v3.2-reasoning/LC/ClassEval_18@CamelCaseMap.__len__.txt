[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step for the CamelCaseMap.__len__ method.
1. The __len__ method is defined to return len(self._data).
2. From the input, self._data is an empty dictionary {}.
3. The length of an empty dictionary is 0.
4. Therefore, when __len__ is called with this self, it returns 0.
