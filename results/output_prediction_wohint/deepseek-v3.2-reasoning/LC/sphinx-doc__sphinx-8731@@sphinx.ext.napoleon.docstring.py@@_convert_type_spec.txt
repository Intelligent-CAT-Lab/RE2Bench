[THOUGHT]
The function `_convert_type_spec` is called with `_type = "str"` and `translations = {}`. The function checks if `_type` is in `translations`. Since `translations` is empty, this condition is false. Next, it checks if `_type == 'None'`, which is false. Then it falls into the else branch and returns `':class:`%s`' % _type`, which becomes `':class:`str`'`. The final unreachable `return _type` statement is not executed. Therefore, the output is the string `':class:`str`'`.
