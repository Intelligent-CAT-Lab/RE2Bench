[THOUGHT]
The function `fit_transform` takes `y` as input, which is given as a string representation of a numpy array. However, in practice, `y` would be converted to a 1D array via `column_or_1d`. The array contains 0s and 1s. The `_unique` function with `return_inverse=True` returns the sorted unique values (`classes_`) and the inverse indices. Since the unique values are `[0, 1]`, the inverse indices are exactly the same as the original array values (0 maps to index 0, 1 to index 1). Therefore, `fit_transform` returns an array of the same values as the input but as integer indices. The output will be a 1D array (or list) of these indices.
