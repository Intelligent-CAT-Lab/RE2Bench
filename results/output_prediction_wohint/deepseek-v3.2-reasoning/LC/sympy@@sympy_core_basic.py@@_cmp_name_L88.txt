[THOUGHT]
The function `_cmp_name` compares two types `x` and `y` based on their class names and a predefined ordering list `ordering_of_classes`. Given the input, `x` is `ImaginaryUnit` and `y` is `Pi`, both from `sympy.core.numbers`. Their names are "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi", which are not equal. Assuming both are subclasses of `Basic` (a base class in SymPy), the function proceeds to check their indices in `ordering_of_classes`. Since `ordering_of_classes` is not provided in the context, I assume both names are not in the list, making both indices UNKNOWN (defined as `len(ordering_of_classes) + 1`). With both indices UNKNOWN, the function falls back to lexicographic comparison of the names. "ImaginaryUnit" lexicographically comes before "Pi" because 'I' < 'P', so the result is -1.
