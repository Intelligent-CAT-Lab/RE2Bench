[THOUGHT]
We are given input string: `"x.x"`. The code processes it as follows:
1. s = input() -> s = '"x.x"'
2. t = ',.?!'
3. For each punctuation in t, replace it with itself plus a space.
   - For '.', replace '.' with '. ', so s becomes '"x. x"'
4. s = ' '.join(s.strip().split()):
   - s.strip() -> '"x. x"'
   - split() -> splits on whitespace, resulting in ['"x.', 'x"']
   - join with space -> '"x. x"' (same as before)
5. For each punctuation in t, replace ' ' + i with i (remove space before punctuation).
   - We look for ' .', ' ,', etc. In s, there is no space before any punctuation (the dot has no space before it). So no change.
6. print(s) outputs: "x. x"
