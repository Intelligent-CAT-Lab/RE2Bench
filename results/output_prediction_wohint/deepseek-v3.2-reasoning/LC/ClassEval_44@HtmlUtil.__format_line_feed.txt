[THOUGHT]
The function `__format_line_feed` is a static method that uses `re.sub` to replace sequences of one or more newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline character. The input text provided is "Some sentence here.", which contains no newline characters. Therefore, the regular expression pattern `\n+` will not match any part of the string, and `re.sub` will return the original text unchanged. The output will be the same as the input text.
