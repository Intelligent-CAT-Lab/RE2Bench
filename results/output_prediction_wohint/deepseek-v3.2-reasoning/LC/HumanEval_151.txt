[THOUGHT]
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` and returns the sum of squares of elements that satisfy three conditions: positive, odd, and no decimal point in their string representation. Given an empty list `[]`, the list comprehension yields an empty list, and the sum of an empty list is 0. Therefore, the output is 0.
