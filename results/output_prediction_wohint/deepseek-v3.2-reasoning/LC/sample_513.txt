[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `f(array)` that modifies the input list in place. The input array is empty: `[]`. Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. First while loop: `while -1 in array:` checks if `-1` is present in the array. Since the array is empty, the condition is false, so we skip this loop entirely.

2. Second while loop: `while 0 in array:` checks if `0` is present. Again, the array is empty, so condition false, skip.

3. Third while loop: `while 1 in array:` checks if `1` is present. Still false, skip.

Thus, no pop operations are performed. The function returns the original array, which remains empty.

Therefore, the output is an empty list: `[]`.
