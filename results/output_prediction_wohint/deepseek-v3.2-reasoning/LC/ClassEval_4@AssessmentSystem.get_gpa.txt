[THOUGHT]
We are given the `AssessmentSystem` class with a `get_gpa` method. The input provides the internal state of `self` with a `students` dictionary containing data for Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The method call is `get_gpa("Charlie")`.

Steps:
1. Check if "Charlie" is in `self.students`. Yes.
2. Check if `self.students["Charlie"]["courses"]` exists and is non-empty. It is a dictionary with two courses: Chemistry (70) and Physics (80).
3. Compute the sum of course values: 70 + 80 = 150.
4. Compute the number of courses: 2.
5. Calculate GPA: 150 / 2 = 75.0.
6. The method returns this value.

Thus, the output is 75.0.
