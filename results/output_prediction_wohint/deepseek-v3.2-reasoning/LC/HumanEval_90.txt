[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `next_smallest` and the input list `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`. Let's simulate the execution:

1. `set(lst)` converts the list to a set, removing duplicates. Since all elements are distinct, we get `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` (order not guaranteed, but sorting will fix it).
2. `sorted(set(lst))` sorts the unique elements, producing `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. Check `len(lst)`: the sorted list has 5 elements, which is >= 2.
4. Therefore, return `lst[1]`, which is the second element: `2`.

The output is `2`.
