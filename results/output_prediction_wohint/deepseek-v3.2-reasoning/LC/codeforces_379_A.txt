[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step with the given input. The input is "80 970". The code reads a line, splits it, and maps to integers, so a = 80, b = 970. Then:
- x = a = 80
- h = 0
- s = 0
First while loop: while x > 0:
  Iterate 80 times: each time decrement x by 1, increment h by 1, increment s by 1.
After this loop, x = 0, h = 80, s = 80.
Second while loop: while s // b != 0:
  s // b = 80 // 970 = 0, so the condition is false, the loop does not run.
Finally, print(h) outputs 80.
Thus, the output is 80.
