[THOUGHT]
We are given inputs to _generate_indices. Since bootstrap is true, it will call random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples) with n_population=4, n_samples=1. The random_state is given as a string representation of a RandomState object. Without knowing the exact seed, we cannot determine the exact output. However, in many test scenarios, random_state is often seeded with a known value (like 0) to ensure reproducibility. Assuming a seed of 0, the first call to randint(0,4,1) returns array([0]). Thus, the output is [0].
