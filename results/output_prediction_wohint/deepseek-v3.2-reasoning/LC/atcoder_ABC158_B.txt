[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The input is read via input(). Given the input JSON, the string value is "1 0 1". However, the JSON shows escaped quotes, but likely the intended input is three integers separated by spaces: 1, 0, 1. I will assume that input() receives the string "1 0 1" (without quotes). Then split() yields ['1', '0', '1']. map(int, ...) converts to integers: N=1, A=0, B=1.
2. Compute ans = N // (A + B) * A = 1 // (0+1) * 0 = 1 // 1 * 0 = 1 * 0 = 0.
3. Compute rem = N % (A + B) = 1 % 1 = 0.
4. ans += min(rem, A) = min(0, 0) = 0.
5. Print ans, which is 0.
Thus the output is 0.
