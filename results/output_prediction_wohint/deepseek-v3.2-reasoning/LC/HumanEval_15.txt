[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `string_sequence(n: int) -> str`. It returns a string that is a space-separated concatenation of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The input specifies `n = 10`. Therefore, we compute:
- `range(10 + 1)` generates numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- Each number is converted to a string.
- The list of strings is joined with a space: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
Thus, the output is this string.
