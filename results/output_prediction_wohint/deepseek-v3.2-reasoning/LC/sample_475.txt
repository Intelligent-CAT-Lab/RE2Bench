[THOUGHT]
We are given a function f(array, index) that first checks if index is negative. If it is, it adjusts the index to len(array) + index, effectively converting negative indices to positive ones (like Python's negative indexing). Then it returns the element at that index in the array.

In the provided input, the arguments are: array = [1] and index = 0. Since index = 0 is not less than 0, the condition index < 0 is false, so we do not adjust the index. Then we return array[0], which is the first element of the list, i.e., 1.

Thus, the output of the function is 1.
