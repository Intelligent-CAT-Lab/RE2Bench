[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the total by iterating over each item in the cart and summing quantity * price.
The cart contains two items:
- Item 1: quantity 10, price 20.0 → 10 * 20.0 = 200.0
- Item 2: quantity 5, price 10.0 → 5 * 10.0 = 50.0
Sum: 200.0 + 50.0 = 250.0
The total method returns this sum.

    "output": 250.0
}
