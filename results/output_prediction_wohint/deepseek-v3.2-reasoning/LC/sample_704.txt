[THOUGHT]
We compute step by step:
1. `len(c)` for `c="99"` is 2.
2. `n=0`, so `width = len(c) * n = 2 * 0 = 0`.
3. `len(s)` for `s="."` is 1.
4. `width - len(s) = 0 - 1 = -1`.
5. The loop `for _ in range(-1):` does not execute because `range(-1)` is empty.
6. Therefore, `s` remains unchanged as `"."`.
7. The function returns `"."`.
