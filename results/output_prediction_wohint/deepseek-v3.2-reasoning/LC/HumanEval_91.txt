[THOUGHT]
We have the function is_bored(S) that splits the input string S into sentences based on the pattern '[.?!]\s*' (i.e., punctuation marks . ? ! followed by optional whitespace). It then counts how many sentences start with the exact two-character string 'I ' (capital I followed by a space).

Given input S = "bIt". The string contains no punctuation marks . ? !, so re.split returns a list with one element: ["bIt"]. For this sentence, we check sentence[0:2] which gives the first two characters: "bI". This is not equal to 'I ' because the second character is 'I' instead of a space. So the condition is False, contributing 0 to the sum. The total sum is 0.

Thus, the output is 0.
