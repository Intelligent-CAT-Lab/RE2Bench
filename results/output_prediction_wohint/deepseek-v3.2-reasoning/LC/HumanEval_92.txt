[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `any_int(x, y, z)` with inputs x=2, y=1, z=1.
1. Check if all are integers: 2, 1, and 1 are integers → condition passes.
2. Check if any two sum to the third: 
   - x + y = 2 + 1 = 3, compared to z=1 → false.
   - x + z = 2 + 1 = 3, compared to y=1 → false.
   - y + z = 1 + 1 = 2, compared to x=2 → true.
   Since one condition is true, the function returns True.
Thus, the output is True.
