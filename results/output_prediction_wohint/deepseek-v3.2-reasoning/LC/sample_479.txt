[THOUGHT]
We simulate the function f(nums, pop1, pop2) with nums = [1, 2, 3], pop1 = 2, pop2 = 4.
1. Compute pop1 - 1 = 1. Call nums.pop(1). This removes the element at index 1, which is 2. After this, nums becomes [1, 3].
2. Compute pop2 - 1 = 3. Attempt to call nums.pop(3). However, the current list [1, 3] has length 2, so the only valid indices are 0 and 1. Index 3 is out of range. This raises an IndexError: pop index out of range.
Thus, the function does not reach the return statement; it raises an exception.
