[THOUGHT]
The input is given as a JSON string: "\"7 5 5\"". This likely means the input string is "7 5 5" with quotes, but considering the code expects integers, it's more plausible that the intended input is "7 5 5" without quotes. Assuming the input string is "7 5 5", then:
1. input() returns "7 5 5".
2. .split() splits into ["7", "5", "5"].
3. map(int, ...) converts to [7, 5, 5].
4. ABC becomes (7, 5, 5).
5. ABC.count(5) is 2, so condition is true.
6. sum(ABC) = 7+5+5 = 17, so the conditional expression evaluates to 'YES'.
7. Therefore, the code prints "YES".
If the input actually includes quotes, then the code would raise a ValueError when trying to convert '"7' to int, causing an error. But given the context, the intended input is likely without quotes.
