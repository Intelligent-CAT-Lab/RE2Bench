[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `level_up` method is called on an instance of `RPGCharacter` with the given state:
   - level = 3
   - hp = 140
   - attack_power = 30
   - defense = 20
   - exp = 0

2. The condition `self.level < 100` (3 < 100) is true, so we enter the if block.

3. Update attributes:
   - `self.level` becomes 3 + 1 = 4
   - `self.exp` is set to 0
   - `self.hp` becomes 140 + 20 = 160
   - `self.attack_power` becomes 30 + 5 = 35
   - `self.defense` becomes 20 + 5 = 25

4. The method returns a tuple:
   (self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)
   = (4, 160, 35, 25)

5. The output is this tuple.
