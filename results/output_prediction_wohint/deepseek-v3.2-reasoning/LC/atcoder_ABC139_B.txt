[THOUGHT]
The input is given as "\"8 9\"". Interpreting the JSON, the actual input string likely contains double quotes, but that would cause a ValueError when converting to int. Alternatively, the intended input might be "8 9" without quotes. Assuming the latter, we have t=8, h=9. Compute (9-2)//(8-1)+1 = 7//7+1 = 2. So the output is 2.
