[THOUGHT]
The `split` method uses `re.split` with a pattern that matches phone numbers of the form XXX-XXX-XXXX as whole words. The text contains three such phone numbers. Splitting on these matches will produce a list of substrings between them. Since the string starts and ends with matches, the result includes empty strings at the start and end. The substrings between matches include the spaces surrounding the words "abiguygusu" and "kjgufwycs". So the output is `["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]`.
