[THOUGHT]
The function `Integer.__lt__` is called with `self` as an `Integer` instance representing 3, and `other` as the string `"1"`. The method first attempts to convert `other` using `_sympify(other)` with `strict=True`. Since `_sympify` with strict mode does not allow strings, it raises a `SympifyError`. This exception is caught, and the method returns `NotImplemented`. Thus, the output is `NotImplemented`.
