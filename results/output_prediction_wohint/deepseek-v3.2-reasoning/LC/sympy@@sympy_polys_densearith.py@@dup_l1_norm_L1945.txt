[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of dup_l1_norm with f = [1, 2] and K = "ZZ".

- First, check if f is empty: f = [1, 2] is not empty, so proceed to the else branch.
- Compute dup_abs(f, K): since K is "ZZ", assuming it represents the integer domain (like sympy's ZZ), K.abs(1) = 1, K.abs(2) = 2, so dup_abs returns [1, 2].
- Then compute K.sum([1, 2]): K.zero is 0 for integers, so sum is 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.
- Return 3.

Therefore, the output is 3.
