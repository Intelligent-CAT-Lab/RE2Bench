[THOUGHT]
The function recall_score is called with y_true=None and y_pred=None. The first step inside precision_recall_fscore_support is to call _check_targets(y_true, y_pred). _check_targets calls type_of_target(y_true) which raises a ValueError because None is not a valid array-like input. Therefore, the function will not return a value but raise an exception.
