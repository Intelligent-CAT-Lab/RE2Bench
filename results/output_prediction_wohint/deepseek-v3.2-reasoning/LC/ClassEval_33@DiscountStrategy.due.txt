[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of the `due` method for the given `DiscountStrategy` instance. The instance has attributes: customer with fidelity 1200, cart with 15 items each priced 10.0 (total 150.0), and a promotion function that is not explicitly defined in the provided code. However, based on common patterns (e.g., from "Fluent Python" examples), the promotion function likely calculates a discount based on customer fidelity. Given that the customer's fidelity is 1200 (> 1000), a typical fidelity promotion gives a 5% discount. Thus, discount = 150.0 * 0.05 = 7.5. The due amount is self.__total - discount = 150.0 - 7.5 = 142.5.
