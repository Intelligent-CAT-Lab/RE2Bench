Looking at the `__eq__` method implementation and the given input:

1. The `__eq__` method checks three conditions:
   - `other.__class__ is self.__class__` (classes must be identical, not just equal)
   - `other.object_id == self.object_id`
   - `other.generation == self.generation`

2. From the input:
   - `self` is an empty object (no attributes specified)
   - `other` is a list `[1, 2]`, which is not an instance of `IndirectReference`

3. When the method executes:
   - `other.__class__` would be `list`
   - `self.__class__` would be `IndirectReference`  
   - Since `list is not IndirectReference`, the first condition evaluates to `False`
   - Due to short-circuit evaluation, the rest of the conditions aren't checked
   - The method returns `False`

[THOUGHT]
The first condition `other.__class__ is self.__class__` fails because `other` is a list while `self` is an `IndirectReference` instance. This causes immediate return of `False` without checking the other attributes.

{
    "return": false
