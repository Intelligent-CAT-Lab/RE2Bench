The method `__eq__` is called with `p1` as a `PolyElement` instance that only has a `_hash` attribute and no dictionary entries (since none are provided in the input). This implies `len(p1)` is 0. The other argument `p2` is the integer 1. 

The method first checks if `not p2`, which is false because 1 is truthy. Next, it checks if `p2` is a `PolyElement` instance with the same ring as `p1`, which fails because `p2` is an integer. Then it checks if `len(p1) > 1`, which is false because `len(p1)` is 0. Finally, it reaches the else branch, which returns `p1.get(p1.ring.zero_monom) == p2`. Since `p1` has no entries, `p1.get` returns `None`. Comparing `None == 1` yields `False`.

Thus, the output is `false`.
