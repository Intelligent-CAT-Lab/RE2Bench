[THOUGHT]
The function `_interval_contains_close` takes an interval (a pair of numbers), a value, and a relative tolerance. It unpacks the interval into `a` and `b`, swaps them if `a > b`, computes an adjusted tolerance as `(b - a) * rtol`, then checks if `val` lies within `[a - rtol, b + rtol]`. 

Given the input:
- `interval` is represented as `"array([0.001, 1.   ])"`, which we interpret as a sequence of two numbers: `a = 0.001`, `b = 1.0`.
- `val` is represented as `"array(0.2)"`, interpreted as the number `0.2`.
- `rtol` is `1e-10`.

Since `a < b`, no swap occurs. Compute:
`b - a = 1.0 - 0.001 = 0.999`.
`rtol = 0.999 * 1e-10 = 9.99e-11`.
Then `a - rtol ≈ 0.001 - 9.99e-11 = 0.0009999999001`.
`b + rtol ≈ 1.0 + 9.99e-11 = 1.0000000000999`.
Check: `0.0009999999001 <= 0.2 <= 1.0000000000999` is true.

Thus, the function returns `True`.
