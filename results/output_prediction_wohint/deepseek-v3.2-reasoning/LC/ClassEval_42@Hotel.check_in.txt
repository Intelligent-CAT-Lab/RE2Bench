[THOUGHT]
We are given the Hotel class and its check_in method. The initial state of the object is:
- name: "Test Hotel"
- available_rooms: {"single": 1, "double": 2}
- booked_rooms: {"single": {}}
The check_in method is called with room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1".

Step-by-step execution:
1. Check if room_type is in self.booked_rooms.keys(): 
   self.booked_rooms is {"single": {}}, so keys are ["single"]. Condition is true, so we proceed.
2. Check if name is in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:
   self.booked_rooms["single"] is empty, so "guest 1" is not present. Condition is false.
3. Since the condition is false, the entire if block is skipped. The method has no further statements and no explicit return value, so it returns None.

Thus, the output is None.
