[THOUGHT]
The `add_argument` method modifies the `self.required` set and `self.types` dictionary based on the provided arguments. In this call, `arg` is "age", `required` is False, and `arg_type` is `<class 'int'>` (interpreted as the `int` type or its string representation). Since `required` is False, `self.required` remains unchanged (empty set). The `self.types` dictionary already has an entry for "age" with the same value, so it remains unchanged. The method does not return any value, so the output of the function call is `None`.
