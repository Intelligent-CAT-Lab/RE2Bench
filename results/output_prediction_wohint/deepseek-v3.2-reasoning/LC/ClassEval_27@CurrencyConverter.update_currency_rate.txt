[THOUGHT]
We are given an instance of CurrencyConverter with self.rates containing additional currencies (KRW) and CNY already set to 7.18. The method update_currency_rate is called with currency="CNY" and new_rate=7.18. Since "CNY" is present in self.rates, the condition `if currency not in self.rates` is false, so we proceed to update self.rates[currency] to new_rate (which is the same as before). The method does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns None. Therefore, the output of the method is None.
