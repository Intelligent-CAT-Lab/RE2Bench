Let's simulate step-by-step:  

1. Input is `"\"BBA\""`, meaning the actual string that `input()` receives is `"BBA"` (including quotes).  
   - In Python, `input()` returns a string exactly as typed, so `s = "\"BBA\""`.  
   - That means `s` contains: `" B B A "` inside quotes.  

2. Condition check: `'A' in s and 'B' in s`  
   - `'A' in "\"BBA\""` → `s` contains `"`, `B`, `B`, `A`, `"` → Yes, `A` is there.  
   - `'B' in "\"BBA\""` → Yes, `B` is there.  

3. So condition is `True`, so `result = 'Yes'`.  

4. Print `'Yes'`.
