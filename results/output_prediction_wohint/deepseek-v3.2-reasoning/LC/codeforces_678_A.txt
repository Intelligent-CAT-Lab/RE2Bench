[THOUGHT]
We are given the Python code:

vamshi, z = map(int, input().split())
print((vamshi // z + 1) * z)

The input is provided as a JSON string: "\"14 15\"". In JSON, the backslashes escape the quotes, meaning the actual input string is "14 15" (including double quotes). However, if the input includes quotes, the code would split into ['"14', '15"'] and fail to convert to integers. Since the problem expects an output, it's more likely that the intended input is the string "14 15" without quotes. Therefore, we assume input() returns "14 15". Then vamshi = 14, z = 15.

Compute: vamshi // z = 14 // 15 = 0. Then (0 + 1) * z = 1 * 15 = 15. The output is 15.
