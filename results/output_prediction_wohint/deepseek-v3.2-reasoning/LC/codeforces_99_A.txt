[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step.

The input is "2.4". 
1. `num = input().split('.')` -> `num = ["2", "4"]`.
2. Check condition `int(num[0][-1]) == 9`: num[0] is "2", last character is "2", int("2") is 2, not 9. So condition false.
3. Else if `int(num[1][0]) >= 5`: num[1] is "4", first character is "4", int("4") is 4, which is not >=5. So condition false.
4. Else: print `num[0]` which is "2".
So the output will be "2".
