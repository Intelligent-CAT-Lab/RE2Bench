[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the `monotonic` function step by step.

1. The input list `l` is `[9, 9, 9, 9]`.
2. Compute `sorted(l)` in increasing order: `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` returns `[9, 9, 9, 9]` because all elements are equal.
3. Check `l == sorted(l)`: `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]` is `True`.
4. Since the first condition is `True`, the function immediately returns `True` (the second condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` does not need to be evaluated because of the `or` short-circuiting, but it would also be `True` since reversing the sorted list gives the same list).
5. Therefore, the output of the function is `True`.
