[THOUGHT]
The function `CheckConstraint.__eq__` compares two `CheckConstraint` instances for equality. Given the input:
- `self` is a `CheckConstraint` instance with `name="price"`, `check` (a Q object with children null, connector "AND", negated false), `violation_error_code="custom_code"`, and `violation_error_message` (a proxy object with specific args and kw).
- `other` is also a `CheckConstraint` instance with identical attributes.

Step-by-step simulation:
1. Check `isinstance(other, CheckConstraint)`: Since `other` is provided as a `CheckConstraint` instance in the input, this condition is true.
2. Compare attributes:
   - `self.name == other.name`: Both are "price", so true.
   - `self.check == other.check`: Both have the same `check` dictionary, so true (assuming the Q objects are equal).
   - `self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code`: Both are "custom_code", so true.
   - `self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message`: Both have identical proxy objects, so true.
3. Since all comparisons are true, the function returns `True`.

Thus, the output is `True`.
