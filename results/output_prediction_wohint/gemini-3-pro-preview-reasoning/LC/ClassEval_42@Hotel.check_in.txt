The user wants to predict the output of the `check_in` method in the `Hotel` class based on the provided input state.

[THOUGHT]
The `check_in` method is invoked with the arguments `room_type='single'`, `room_number=2`, and `name='guest 1'`. The code first checks if the specified `room_type` exists in `self.booked_rooms`, which is true for "single". It then proceeds to check if `name` is explicitly present in the dictionary associated with that room type. In the provided input state, `booked_rooms['single']` is an empty dictionary, meaning the guest name is not found. As a result, the code execution skips the conditional block associated with handling the booking and reaches the end of the function without returning a specific value, implicitly returning `None`.
