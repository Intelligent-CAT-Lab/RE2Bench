The user wants the output of the function `_generate_unsampled_indices`.
    
**Reasoning Process:**
1.  **Initialize Random State**: The function starts by initializing a random number generator using `check_random_state(209652396)`. This corresponds to `numpy.random.RandomState(209652396)`.
    
2.  **Generate Sample Indices**:
    *   The function calls `random_instance.randint(0, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap, dtype=np.int32)`.
    *   Here, `n_samples` = 150 and `n_samples_bootstrap` = 150.
    *   This generates an array of 150 integers, where each integer is uniformly distributed between 0 (inclusive) and 150 (exclusive). This simulates a bootstrap sample with replacement.
    
3.  **Count Occurrences**:
    *   `np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=n_samples)` counts how many times each index from 0 to 149 appears in the generated sample.
    
4.  **Identify Unsampled Indices**:
    *   `unsampled_mask = sample_counts == 0` creates a boolean mask where `True` indicates that the index was *not* selected in the bootstrap sample (count is 0).
    *   `indices_range = np.arange(n_samples)` creates the array `[0, 1, ..., 149]`.
    *   `unsampled_indices = indices_range[unsampled_mask]` selects the indices that correspond to the `True` values in the mask.
    
5.  **Result**:
    *   The function returns the array of `unsampled_indices`. Based on the deterministic nature of `numpy.random.RandomState` with the specific seed `209652396`, the logic produces a specific set of indices that were not chosen.
    
    *Simulating the RandomState(209652396).randint(0, 150, 150) execution yields specific indices. The indices not present in that set are identified.*

    (The output below contains the calculated unsampled indices for this specific seed).
