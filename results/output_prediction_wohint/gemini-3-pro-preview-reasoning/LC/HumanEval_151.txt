Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Analyze the input**: The function `double_the_difference` is called with an argument `lst` which is an empty list `[]`.
2.  **Analyze the list comprehension**: The code executes `[i ** 2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and ('.' not in str(i))]`.
3.  **Iterate**: Since `lst` is empty (`[]`), the iteration `for i in lst` immediately finishes without processing any elements.
4.  **Result of comprehension**: The result is an empty list `[]`.
5.  **Calculate Sum**: The function returns `sum([])`. In Python, the sum of an empty iterable is `0`.
6.  **Return**: The function returns `0`.
