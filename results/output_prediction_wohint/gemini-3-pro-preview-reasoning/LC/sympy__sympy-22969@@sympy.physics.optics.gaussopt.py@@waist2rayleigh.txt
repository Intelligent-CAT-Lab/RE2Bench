The function `waist2rayleigh(w, wavelen, n=1)` calculates the Rayleigh length (or range) of a Gaussian beam.

**Trace of Execution:**

1.  **Input Parsing:**
    The input provided is:
    ```json
    "args": {
        "w": "w_0",
        "wavelen": "l",
        "n": "1"
    }
    ```
    This translates to a function call: `waist2rayleigh(w="w_0", wavelen="l", n="1")`. Note that "1" is passed as a string in the JSON arguments, but given the context of a successful execution prediction and the nature of the parameter `n` (refractive index, a multiplier), it is treated as the number 1 (or automatically casted/sympified in a way that allows multiplication, though `sympify` isn't called on `n`). If `n` were strictly the string "1", the multiplication `w**2 * n` with a SymPy symbol would raise a TypeError. We assume `n` is interpreted as the integer `1`.

2.  **Sympify Arguments:**
    The code executes:
    ```python
    w, wavelen = map(sympify, (w, wavelen))
    ```
    - `w` becomes the SymPy symbol `w_0` (from string "w_0").
    - `wavelen` becomes the SymPy symbol `l` (from string "l").

3.  **Calculation:**
    The return statement is:
    ```python
    return w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen
    ```
    Substitutions:
    - `w` $\rightarrow$ `Symbol('w_0')`
    - `n` $\rightarrow$ `1`
    - `pi` $\rightarrow$ `sympy.core.numbers.pi`
    - `wavelen` $\rightarrow$ `Symbol('l')`

    Expression: `Symbol('w_0')**2 * 1 * pi / Symbol('l')`

    SymPy handles the multiplication and division. The constant `1` is the identity for multiplication. The term `pi` is a NumberSymbol.
    The resulting symbolic expression is $\frac{\pi w_0^2}{l}$.

4.  **String Representation:**
    SymPy's string printer orders terms typically with numerical coefficients (like `pi`) first, followed by symbols alphabetically or by complexity.
    - `pi` comes first.
    - `w_0**2` follows.
    - Division by `l` is represented as `/l`.
    
    The string representation is `"pi*w_0**2/l"`.
