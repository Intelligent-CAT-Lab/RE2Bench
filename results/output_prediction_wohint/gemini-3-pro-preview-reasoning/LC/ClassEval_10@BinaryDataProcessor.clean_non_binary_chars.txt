The function `clean_non_binary_chars` is being called.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize Context**: The class `BinaryDataProcessor` has a method `clean_non_binary_chars`.
2.  **Input State**: The instance variable `self.binary_string` is set to `"01101000011011010110001001101111"`.
3.  **Execute Logic**: The line `self.binary_string = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string))` is executed.
    *   The `filter` function iterates over the characters of `self.binary_string`.
    *   The lambda condition `x in '01'` checks if the character is '0' or '1'.
    *   Scanning the input string: all characters are either '0' or '1'.
    *   Therefore, all characters are kept.
    *   `''.join(...)` joins these characters back into a string.
    *   The resulting string is identical to the input: `"01101000011011010110001001101111"`.
    *   This value is assigned back to `self.binary_string`.
4.  **Determine Return Value**: The method `clean_non_binary_chars` does not have a `return` statement. In Python, this effectively means it returns `None`.
5.  **Format Output**: The JSON representation of `None` is `null`.
