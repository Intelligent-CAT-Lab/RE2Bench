The function `add_argument` is defined to update the internal state of the `ArgumentParser` instance but does not return any value. Let's trace the execution:

1.  **Input Parsing**: The function is called with `arg="age"`, `required=False`, and `arg_type=<class 'int'>`. The `self` object has `required` (empty set) and `types` (dictionary with existing keys).
2.  **Required Check**: The code checks `if required:`. Since `required` is passed as `False` in `kwargs`, the condition is false. The line `self.required.add(arg)` is skipped.
3.  **Type Registration**: The code executes `self.types[arg] = arg_type`. It updates `self.types` explicitly setting the key `"age"` to the value `int` (or the string representation provided, depending on interpretation, but the logic remains the same).
4.  **Return**: The function finishes execution. No `return` statement is present.
5.  **Result**: Python functions imply a return value of `None` when no return statement is executed. In JSON, this is represented as `null`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `add_argument` is invoked with `arg="age"`, `required=False`, and `arg_type` representing the `int` type.
1. The `if required:` condition evaluates to `False`. The statement `self.required.add(arg)` is skipped.
2. The assignment `self.types[arg] = arg_type` is executed. This updates the `self.types` dictionary key `"age"` with the value corresponding to `int`.
3. The function execution completes. Since there is no explicit `return` statement, the function returns `None`.
