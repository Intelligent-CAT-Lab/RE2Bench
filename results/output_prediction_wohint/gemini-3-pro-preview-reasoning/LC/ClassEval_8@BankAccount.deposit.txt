The inputs specify an instance of `BankAccount` with `balance=0` and a call to the `deposit` method with `amount=300`.

1.  **Check Condition**: The `deposit` method starts by checking `if amount < 0`. Here, `amount` is 300, which is not less than 0, so the `ValueError` is not raised.
2.  **Update State**: The code executes `self.balance += amount`.
    *   `self.balance` starts at 0.
    *   `amount` is 300.
    *   New `self.balance` becomes `0 + 300 = 300`.
3.  **Return Value**: The method returns `self.balance`, which is now 300.
