To predict the output of the `__eq__` method, we simulate the execution step by step based on the provided input.

**Input Variables:**
*   `p1`: An instance of `PolyElement`. The input JSON `{"_hash": 1651261762238379522}` shows the object's state. Since `PolyElement` inherits from `dict`, and no dictionary items (monomial coefficients) are listed in the JSON, `p1` acts as an empty dictionary (representing the zero polynomial). The `_hash` is an attribute stored in `__dict__`.
*   `p2`: The integer `1`.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  **Method Call**: `p1.__eq__(p2)` is called. The parameters are `p1` (self) and `p2 = 1`.

2.  **Condition 1**: `if not p2:`
    *   `p2` is `1`.
    *   `not 1` is `False`.
    *   The condition evaluates to `False`.

3.  **Condition 2**: `elif isinstance(p2, PolyElement) and p2.ring == p1.ring:`
    *   `p2` is of type `int`, not `PolyElement`.
    *   The condition evaluates to `False`.

4.  **Condition 3**: `elif len(p1) > 1:`
    *   `p1` behaves as a dictionary. Based on the input, it has no items (monomials).
    *   `len(p1)` is `0`.
    *   `0 > 1` is `False`.
    *   The condition evaluates to `False`.

5.  **Else Block**:
    *   Code: `return p1.get(p1.ring.zero_monom) == p2`
    *   `p1` is an empty dictionary.
    *   Calling `get` on an empty dictionary with any key returns `None` (the default value).
    *   The expression evaluates `None == 1`.
    *   This results in `False`.

**Conclusion:**
The execution determines that the empty polynomial `p1` (Zero) is not equal to the scalar `1`.
