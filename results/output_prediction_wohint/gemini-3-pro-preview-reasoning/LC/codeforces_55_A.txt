Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer from the input. The provided input value is `"9"`. Converting this to an integer, `n` becomes `9`.
2.  **While Loop Condition**: The code checks the condition `n % 2 == 0`.
    *   Calculating modulo: `9 % 2` equals `1`.
    *   Comparison: `1 == 0` is `False`.
    *   Since the condition is false, the loop body (`n /= 2`) is skipped entirely. The value of `n` remains `9`.
3.  **If Condition**: The code checks `if n == 1`.
    *   Comparison: `9 == 1` is `False`.
4.  **Else Block**: Since the `if` condition was false, the code proceeds to the `else` block.
5.  **Output**: The command `print('NO')` is executed.
