[THOUGHT]
The function `_consumes_sample_weight` is called with an instance of `KNeighborsClassifier` as the `estimator`.

1.  **Check Metadata Routing Status**:
    The function first calls `_routing_enabled()`.
    Inside `_routing_enabled()`, it calls `get_config().get("enable_metadata_routing", False)`.
    Since no configuration context is provided in the input, the default value is returned, which is `False`.

2.  **Determine Parameter Consumption via Signature**:
    Since routing is disabled, the function proceeds to the `else` block:
    `consumes_sample_weight = has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight')`

3.  **Execute `has_fit_parameter`**:
    This function checks two things:
    -   `hasattr(estimator, "fit")`: `KNeighborsClassifier` has a `fit` method. This is True.
    -   `'sample_weight' in signature(estimator.fit).parameters`:
        The standard `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.fit` method has the signature `def fit(self, X, y)`. It constructs a nearest/ball tree index based on the spatial coordinates of X. It does not accept `sample_weight` (sample weights are sometimes used in `score` or calculation of weighted votes, but not in the indexing `fit` step for this estimator).
        Therefore, `'sample_weight'` is **not** in the parameter list.

4.  **Result**:
    `has_fit_parameter` returns `False`.
    Consequently, `_consumes_sample_weight` returns `False`.
