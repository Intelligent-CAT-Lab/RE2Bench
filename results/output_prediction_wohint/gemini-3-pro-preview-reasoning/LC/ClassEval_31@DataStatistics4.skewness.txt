Calculation of skewness for a uniform dataset.

1.  **Initialize**: The input data is `[1, 1, 1]`. length $n = 3$.
2.  **Calculate Mean**: The sum is 3, so the mean is $3 / 3 = 1.0$.
3.  **Calculate Variance**: Since all elements equal the mean ($1.0$), the sum of squared differences is 0. Variance becomes 0.
4.  **Calculate Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance 0 is 0.
5.  **Calculate Skewness**: The formula includes a check for `std_deviation != 0`. Since the standard deviation is 0, the code follows the `else` branch and returns 0.
