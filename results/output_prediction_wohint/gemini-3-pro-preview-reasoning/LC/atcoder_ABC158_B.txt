Let's execute the code step by step using the provided input.

1.  **Input Reading**: The code executes `N, A, B = map(int, input().split())`.
    The input string provided is `"1 0 1"`. When split by whitespace, we get `['1', '0', '1']`.
    Mapping these to integers assigns:
    `N = 1`
    `A = 0`
    `B = 1`

2.  **Calculate Initial Answer**:
    Code: `ans = N // (A + B) * A`
    Substitute values: `ans = 1 // (0 + 1) * 0`
    `A + B` is `1`.
    `1 // 1` is `1`.
    `1 * 0` is `0`.
    So, `ans` is `0`.

3.  **Calculate Remainder**:
    Code: `rem = N % (A + B)`
    Substitute values: `rem = 1 % (0 + 1)`
    `rem = 1 % 1` is `0`.

4.  **Update Answer**:
    Code: `ans += min(rem, A)`
    Substitute values: `ans += min(0, 0)`
    `min(0, 0)` is `0`.
    `ans` becomes `0 + 0`, which is `0`.

5.  **Print Output**:
    Code: `print(ans)`
    The value `0` is printed to the standard output.

[THOUGHT]
The code calculates the sum of 'A' items in a repeating sequence of 'A' items followed by 'B' items, up to a total length of 'N'.
1. Inputs are parsed: N=1, A=0, B=1.
2. The cycle length is A + B = 1.
3. Number of full cycles in N is N // (A+B) = 1 // 1 = 1.
4. Contribution from full cycles is 1 * A = 1 * 0 = 0.
5. Remainder is N % (A+B) = 1 % 1 = 0.
6. Contribution from remainder is min(rem, A) = min(0, 0) = 0.
7. Total ans = 0 + 0 = 0.
