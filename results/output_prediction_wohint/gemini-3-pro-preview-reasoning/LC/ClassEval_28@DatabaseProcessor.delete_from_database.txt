[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `delete_from_database` method in the `DatabaseProcessor` class.

1.  **Initialization**: An instance of `DatabaseProcessor` is created with `database_name="test.db"`.
2.  **Method Call**: `delete_from_database("test_table", "Alice")` is called.
3.  **Execution Steps**:
    *   `conn = sqlite3.connect("test.db")`: Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
    *   `cursor = conn.cursor()`: Creates a cursor object.
    *   `delete_query = 'DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?'`: Constructs the SQL query string.
    *   `cursor.execute(delete_query, ("Alice",))`: Executes the SQL command. This operation modifies the database file but produces no return value within the Python function scope.
    *   `conn.commit()`: Commits the transaction.
    *   `conn.close()`: Closes the database connection.
4.  **Return Value**: The function `delete_from_database` does not contain a `return` statement. In Python, functions without an explicit return statement return `None`.
5.  **JSON Mapping**: In the requested JSON output format, Python's `None` is represented as `null`.

Therefore, the output is `null`.
