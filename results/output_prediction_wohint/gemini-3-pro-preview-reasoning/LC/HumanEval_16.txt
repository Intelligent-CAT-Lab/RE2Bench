The user wants the output of the function `count_distinct_characters` when the input string is `"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY"`.

**Step 1: Analyze the input.**
The input argument `string` is `"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY"`.

**Step 2: Execute `string.lower()`.**
The function first converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
- "Jerry" becomes "jerry"
- " " remains " "
- "jERRY" becomes "jerry"
- " " remains " "
- "JeRRRY" becomes "jerrry"
Concatenating these, the lowercased string is `"jerry jerry jerrry"`.

**Step 3: Execute `set(string.lower())`.**
The `set()` function iterates over the string and stores only unique characters. Let's list the distinct characters found:
1.  `'j'` (from the start)
2.  `'e'`
3.  `'r'`
4.  `'y'`
5.  `' '` (the space character between words)

Subsequent characters in the string ("jerrry", etc.) are repetitions of these five characters.
- The set will be: `{'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', ' '}`. Note that order in a set is not guaranteed, but the elements are distinct.

**Step 4: Execute `len(...)`.**
Count the number of items in the set.
There are 5 distinct characters: 'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', and space.

**Step 5: Return result.**
The function returns the integer 5.
