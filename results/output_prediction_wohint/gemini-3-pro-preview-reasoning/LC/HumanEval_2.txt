The code defines a function `truncate_number` that performs a modulo operation on the input `number` with `1.0`. This mathematical operation effectively separates the fractional part of a floating-point number from its integer part. When `1.33` is processed, the integer `1.0` is removed, leaving the fractional remainder.
