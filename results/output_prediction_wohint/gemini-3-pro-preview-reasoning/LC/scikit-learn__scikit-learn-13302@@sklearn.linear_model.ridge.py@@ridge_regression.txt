The input `ridge_regression` function is a wrapper around Scikit-Learn's `_ridge_regression` (implied by the context and variable names). The arguments provided are a feature matrix `X` of shape (6, 5), a target vector `y` of shape (6,), an `alpha` of 1.0, and `solver='cholesky'`.

The function performs Ridge Regression, which solves the linear system $(X^T X + \alpha I) w = X^T y$ for the coefficients $w$. The intercept is not calculated (`return_intercept` is False and data is not centered by the function in this raw form).

Based on the simulated matrix operations:
1.  **Calculate $X^T y$ (Vector $b$):**
    Using the provided values for columns of $X$ and $y$:
    $b \approx [-4.15, -2.17, -5.47, -17.67, -16.63]$

2.  **Calculate $X^T X + I$ (Matrix $A$):**
    The diagonal elements (including $\alpha=1$) are approximately $[13.83, 6.80, 3.38, 9.03, 12.87]$.
    Off-diagonal elements show significant correlations, particularly between columns 3 and 4 (approx 4.5) and columns 0 and 4 (approx -5.3).

3.  **Solve $A w = b$:**
    Due to the correlations and magnitudes of $b$, $w_3$ and $w_4$ are the largest (negative) weights. Iteratively solving the system yields:
    *   $w_0 \approx -0.22$
    *   $w_1 \approx 0.13$
    *   $w_2 \approx -0.35$
    *   $w_3 \approx -1.43$
    *   $w_4 \approx -0.81$

The return value is a numpy array of the coefficients.
