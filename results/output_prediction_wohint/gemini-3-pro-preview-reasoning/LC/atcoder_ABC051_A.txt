The code reads a line of input and replaces all commas `,` with spaces ` `.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Read Input**: The input comes from the value associated with the "input" key in the provided JSON. The JSON value is `"\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\""`. When parsed as a string, this includes the double quotes at the start and end. Thus, result of `input()` is the string `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`.
2.  **Process**: The method `.replace(',', ' ')` is called on the string `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`.
3.  **Execute Replacement**: The method finds two commas in the string.
    -   The first comma is between `c` and `f`.
    -   The second comma is between `m` and `g`.
    -   Replacing these with spaces results in string `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`.
    -   The double quotes remain part of the string as they are not commas.
4.  **Result**: The final string `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"` is printed.
