[THOUGHT]
The function `math_to_image` is called with `s="$x^2$"`.
Inside the function:
1.  `MathTextParser('path')` is initialized to parse mathematical text.
2.  `parser.parse("$x^2$", dpi=72, prop=None)` is called. This validates and computes the metrics of the rendered LaTeX-like string.
3.  The string "$x^2$" contains the variable "x" and a superscript "2".
    -   The glyph "x" in standard mathematical fonts (Computer Modern) sits on the baseline, meaning its depth (descent below baseline) is 0.
    -   The superscript "2" is placed above the x, so it also does not extend below the baseline.
    -   Consequently, the overall `depth` of the rendered expression is 0.
    -   The `width` and `height` would be positive non-zero values, but `depth` specifically measures the extent below the baseline.
4.  A figure is created and the text is drawn.
5.  The figure is saved to `filename_or_obj`.
6.  The function returns `depth`.

Based on the components of the string "$x^2$", the depth is 0.
