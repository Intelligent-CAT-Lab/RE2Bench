Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with arguments `string="UppEr"` and `encryption=0`.
2. The code checks the condition `if encryption == 0:`.
3. The value of `encryption` is `0`, so the condition `0 == 0` evaluates to `True`.
4. The execution enters the `if` block: `return string`.
5. The function returns the original string `string`, which is "UppEr".
6. The `else` block (which contains `string.upper().encode('rot13')`) is skipped.

    "output": "UppEr"
