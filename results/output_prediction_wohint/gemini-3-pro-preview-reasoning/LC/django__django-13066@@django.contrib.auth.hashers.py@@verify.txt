[THOUGHT]
The `verify` method of `Argon2PasswordHasher` is called.
1.  `self._load_library()` is called. `self.library` resolves to the class attribute `'argon2'`. The `argon2` module is imported successfully.
2.  The `encoded` string `"argon2$argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$Y041dExhNkljRUUy$TMa6A8fPJhCAUXRhJXCXdw"` is split at the first `$`.
    *   `algorithm` = `"argon2"`
    *   `rest` = `"argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$Y041dExhNkljRUUy$TMa6A8fPJhCAUXRhJXCXdw"`
3.  `assert algorithm == self.algorithm` checks `"argon2" == "argon2"`, which is True.
4.  `argon2.PasswordHasher().verify('$' + rest, password)` is called.
    *   The constructed hash string passed to the library is `"$argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$Y041dExhNkljRUUy$TMa6A8fPJhCAUXRhJXCXdw"`.
    *   The `password` is `"secret"`.
    *   The `verify` method of the `argon2` library parses parameters (`m=102400`, `t=2`, `p=8`) from the hash string itself and verifies the password.
    *   The provided hash is a valid hash for the password "secret" with the given parameters and salt (standard Django test vector).
    *   The library's `verify` method returns `True` on success.
5.  No `argon2.exceptions.VerificationError` is raised.
6.  The function returns `True`.
