The function takes the input dictionary `d` and creates a shallow copy to prevent modifying the original structure. It then applies the `popitem()` method, which removes the last key-value pair added to the dictionary based on insertion order. Consequently, the entry `"x:": 3` is removed, and the remaining dictionary containing the first two items is returned.
