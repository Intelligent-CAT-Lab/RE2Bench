Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Parsing**: The program begins by reading an input from standard input. The provided input is `"99"` inside the JSON.
    `N = int(input())` takes the string `"99"` and converts it to the integer `99`. So, `N = 99`.

2.  **Conditional Check**: The code checks the condition `if N % 2 == 0`.
    *   `99 % 2` equals `1` because 99 is an odd number.
    *   The condition `1 == 0` evaluates to `False`.

3.  **Branching**: Since the condition is `False`, the code executes the `else` block.

4.  **Calculation**: The statement to execute is `print((N + 1) / N / 2)`.
    *   Substitute `N` with `99`: `(99 + 1) / 99 / 2`.
    *   Evaluated parenthesis first: `100 / 99 / 2`.
    *   In Python 3, division `/` is always floating-point division and is left-associative.
    *   First division: `100 / 99`. As a repeating decimal, this is $1.\overline{01}$. In standard double-precision floating point, this is approximately `1.0101010101010102`.
    *   Second division: Divide the result by `2`.
    *   `1.0101010101010102 / 2` results in `0.5050505050505051`.
    *   Mathematically, this is equivalent to $\frac{100}{99 \times 2} = \frac{100}{198} = \frac{50}{99}$.
    *   $\frac{50}{99} = 0.\overline{50}$. Python's float representation rounds this to `0.5050505050505051`.

5.  **Output**: The pure float value is printed to stdout.

[THOUGHT]
The input N is 99.
The condition `99 % 2 == 0` is False.
The else block executes `print((99 + 1) / 99 / 2)`.
The expression evaluates to `100 / 99 / 2`.
`100 / 99` is approximately `1.0101010101010102`.
Dividing by 2 gives `0.5050505050505051`.
The output is the string representation of this float.
