Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Initialization**: The function `f` is called with `text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx"` and `chars = "mk"`. Inside the function, `num_applies` is set to 2, and `extra_chars` is initialized as an empty string `''`.

2.  **Loop Iteration 1 (i = 0)**:
    *   `extra_chars` is updated: `extra_chars += chars` results in `'' + 'mk' = 'mk'`.
    *   The code executes `text.replace(extra_chars, '')`, which is `text.replace('mk', '')`.
    *   We inspect the string `text` ("zbzquiuqnmfkx") for the substring "mk".
    *   The string contains the sequence "...nmfkx...". Although it has 'm' and 'k', they are separated by 'f'. The specific substring "mk" never appears contiguously.
    *   Therefore, `text.replace` makes no changes. `text` remains `"zbzquiuqnmfkx"`.

3.  **Loop Iteration 2 (i = 1)**:
    *   `extra_chars` is updated: `extra_chars += chars`. The current value is "mk", so it becomes `"mk" + "mk" = "mkmk"`.
    *   The code executes `text.replace('mkmk', '')`.
    *   The string "zbzquiuqnmfkx" does not contain "mkmk".
    *   `text` remains `"zbzquiuqnmfkx"`.

4.  **Completion**: The loop finishes. The function returns `text`.
