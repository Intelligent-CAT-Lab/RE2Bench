[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` and extracts two items from it based on the sort order of their keys.

1.  **Input Dictionary**: The input `d` is `{'2': 3, '17': 3, '16': 6}`. Note that the keys are strings ("2", "17", "16").

2.  **First Extraction (`key1`, `val1`)**:
    *   The code executes `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)`.
    *   It sorts the items based on keys in descending order. Since the keys are strings, the comparison is lexicographical (character by character), not numerical.
        *   Comparing "2" vs "17": The first character '2' has a higher ASCII value than '1', so "2" > "17".
        *   Comparing "17" vs "16": The first characters are equal ('1'). The second character '7' is greater than '6', so "17" > "16".
    *   The sorted order of keys is `['2', '17', '16']`.
    *   The first element (`[0]`) is the tuple `('2', 3)`. Its key (`[0]`) is `"2"`.
    *   So, `key1` = "2".
    *   `val1` = `d.pop("2")` = 3.
    *   The dictionary `d` is now `{'17': 3, '16': 6}`.

3.  **Second Extraction (`key2`, `val2`)**:
    *   The code executes the sort again on the remaining items: `{'17': 3, '16': 6}`.
    *   Comparing keys "17" and "16": As established, "17" > "16".
    *   The sorted order is `['17', '16']`.
    *   The first element is the tuple `('17', 3)`. Its key is `"17"`.
    *   So, `key2` = "17".
    *   `val2` = `d.pop("17")` = 3.
    *   The dictionary `d` is now `{'16': 6}`.

4.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns a new dictionary created from `{key1: val1, key2: val2}`.
    *   Substituting values: `{"2": 3, "17": 3}`.

5.  **Output**: The resulting dictionary is `{'2': 3, '17': 3}`.
