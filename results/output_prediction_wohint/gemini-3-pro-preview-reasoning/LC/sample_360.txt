Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Analyze the inputs**: The function `f` is called with `text` = "g" and `n` = 15.

2.  **Evaluate the first condition**:
    The code checks `if len(text) <= 2:`.
    *   `text` is "g", so `len(text)` is 1.
    *   The condition `1 <= 2` is `True`.

3.  **Execute the conditional block**:
    Since the condition is true, the function executes `return text`.
    *   It returns the original string "g".

4.  **Skip remaining code**: The lines calculating `leading_chars` are never reached because the function has already returned.

5.  **Final Result**: The output is "g".
