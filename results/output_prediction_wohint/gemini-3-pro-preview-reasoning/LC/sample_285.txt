To predict the output, I will trace the execution of the function `f` with the provided inputs.

1.  **Identify Inputs**: The function `f` is called with:
    *   `text` = `"This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!"`
    *   `ch` = `" "` (a single space character)

2.  **Execute Logic**: The function executes the statement `return text.count(ch)`. This Python string method counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `ch` within `text`.

3.  **Process Counting**: I will scan `text` for spaces:
    *   "This` `be..." -> Found space (count: 1)
    *   "...be` `Pirate's..." -> Found space (count: 2)
    *   "...Pirate's` `Speak..." -> Found space (count: 3)
    *   "...Speak` `for..." -> Found space (count: 4)
    *   "...for` `'help'!" -> Found space (count: 5)
    *   The remaining part "'help'!" contains no spaces.

4.  **Final Result**: The total count is 5.
