I'll simulate the execution of the provided Python code with the given input.

[THOUGHT]
The code snippet performs simple arithmetic operations based on the input values.
1.  **Input Reading**: The execution starts with `input().split()`. The input provided in the JSON is `"\"1 1 1\""`. Interpreting standard JSON string escaping, the actual string passed to the standard input is likely `1 1 1` (if the quotes were part of the string content, the conversion to integer would fail with a `ValueError`).
    - The string `"1 1 1"` is split by whitespace into a list of strings: `['1', '1', '1']`.
    - `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers.
    - These are unpacked into variables: `A = 1`, `B = 1`, `T = 1`.

2.  **Calculation**: The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `T // A * B`.
    - Python evaluates operators with the same precedence (multiplication `*` and floor division `//`) from left to right.
    - First operation: `T // A` which is `1 // 1`. The result is `1`.
    - Second operation: `(Result) * B` which is `1 * 1`. The result is `1`.
    - So, `ans` becomes `1`.

3.  **Output**: The `print(ans)` statement prints the integer `1` to the standard output.
