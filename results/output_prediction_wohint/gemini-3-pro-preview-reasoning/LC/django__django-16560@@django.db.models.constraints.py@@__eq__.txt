The function `__eq__` compares the current instance (`self`) with another object (`other`) to determine if they are equal.

1.  **Type Check**: The first check is `isinstance(other, CheckConstraint)`. Based on the input structure provided for `other`, it matches the structure of `self` (a `CheckConstraint`), so we proceed with the assumption that it is the correct type.
2.  **Attribute Comparison**: The method checks equality for valid attributes:
    *   **`name`**: `self.name` is "price" and `other.name` is also "price". Result: **Equal**.
    *   **`check`**: `self.check` is `{'children': None, 'connector': 'AND', 'negated': False}` and `other.check` is identical. Result: **Equal**.
    *   **`violation_error_code`**: `self.violation_error_code` is "custom_code" and `other.violation_error_code` is "custom_code". Result: **Equal**.
    *   **`violation_error_message`**: Both `self` and `other` contain identical internal state for the lazy translation proxy (`_proxy____args` and `_proxy____kw` match). Result: **Equal**.
3.  **Result**: Since all compared attributes are equal, the conjunction (`and` operations) evaluates to `True`.

[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method compares `self` and `other` based on `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message`.
1. `self.name` ("price") == `other.name` ("price") is True.
2. `self.check` (dictionary with children=None, connector="AND", negated=False) == `other.check` (identical dictionary) is True.
3. `self.violation_error_code` ("custom_code") == `other.violation_error_code` ("custom_code") is True.
4. `self.violation_error_message` matches `other.violation_error_message` as their proxy arguments and keywords are identical.
All conditions are met.
