[THOUGHT]
The user wants the output of the `write_xml` method.

1.  **State Initialization**:
    - `self.root` is explicitly set to `None`.
    - The argument `file_name` is an empty string `""`.

2.  **Execution Trace**:
    - The code enters the `try` block.
    - `tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root)`: `ET.ElementTree(None)` is a valid call. It creates an `ElementTree` instance where the internal root element is `None`.
    - `tree.write(file_name)`: This calls `tree.write("")`.
    - The `write` method performs two main actions that could fail here:
        a. It attempts to open the file specified by `file_name` for writing. Opening a file with an empty string name (`""`) typically raises an `OSError` (specifically `FileNotFoundError` or `ENOENT` depending on the OS).
        b. Even if the file opening logic were bypassed or handled, the `ElementTree` has no root element. Attempting to serialize a `None` root usually results in an internal error (like `AttributeError` or a specific library error) because it expects an `Element` object.
    - Due to the invalid filename `""`, an exception is guaranteed to be raised immediately when trying to open the file.

3.  **Exception Handling**:
    - The raised exception is caught by the bare `except:` clause.
    - The `except` block executes `return False`.

4.  **Conclusion**:
    - The function returns `False`.
