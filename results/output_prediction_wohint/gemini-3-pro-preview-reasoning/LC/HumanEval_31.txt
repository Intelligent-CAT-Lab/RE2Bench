[THOUGHT]
The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` and checks if it is prime. The input provided is `n = 13441`.
1. The function first checks if `n < 2`. 13441 is not less than 2, so it proceeds.
2. It iterates through numbers `k` starting from 2 up to `n - 2`. It checks if `n` is divisible by `k` (i.e., `n % k == 0`).
3. To determine divisibility efficiently without iterating all the way, we can check prime factors up to the square root of 13441. The square root of 13441 is approximately 115.9.
4. Testing small primes:
   - Not divisible by 2 (odd).
   - Sum of digits is $1+3+4+4+1 = 13$, not divisible by 3.
   - Ends in 1, not divisible by 5.
   - For 7: 13441 / 7 = 1920.14...
   - For 11: $1-3+4-4+1 = -1$, not divisible by 11.
   - For 13: 13441 = 13000 + 441. 441 is not divisible by 13.
   - For 17: $17 \times 800 = 13600$. $13600 - 13441 = 159$. 159 is not divisible by 17.
   - For 19: $19 \times 700 = 13300$. $13441 - 13300 = 141$. $141 / 19 \approx 7.4$.
   - For 23, 29, 31, etc.
   - Actually, $19 \times 707 = 13433$. $13441 - 13433 = 8$.
5. We check divisibility by larger primes or simply check known prime factorizations. $13441$ is actually a prime number.
6. Since no divisor is found in the loop range, the function returns `True`.
