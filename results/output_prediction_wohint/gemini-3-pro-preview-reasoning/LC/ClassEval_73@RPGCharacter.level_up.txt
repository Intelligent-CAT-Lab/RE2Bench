[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to simulate the execution of the `level_up` method for an instance of `RPGCharacter` with specific initial state.

1.  **Initialize State**: The object `self` has the following attributes based on the input:
    *   `name`: "John"
    *   `hp`: 140
    *   `attack_power`: 30
    *   `defense`: 20
    *   `level`: 3
    *   `exp`: 0

2.  **Execute `level_up` method**:
    *   Check condition: `if self.level < 100:`
    *   Current level is 3. Since 3 < 100 is true, the code inside the `if` block executes.
    *   `self.level += 1`: Level becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
    *   `self.exp = 0`: Exp is set to 0.
    *   `self.hp += 20`: HP becomes 140 + 20 = 160.
    *   `self.attack_power += 5`: Attack power becomes 30 + 5 = 35.
    *   `self.defense += 5`: Defense becomes 20 + 5 = 25.

3.  **Return values**:
    *   The method returns a tuple: `(self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)`.
    *   Substituting the updated values: `(4, 160, 35, 25)`.

4.  **Format Output**:
    *   Python tuples are represented as JSON lists (arrays).
    *   Output should be `[4, 160, 35, 25]`.
