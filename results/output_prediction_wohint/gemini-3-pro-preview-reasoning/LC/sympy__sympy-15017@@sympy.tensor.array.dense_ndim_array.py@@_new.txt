The function `_new` is a classmethod responsible for creating instances of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`. It takes `iterable`, `shape`, and `kwargs` as arguments.

**Step-by-step Derivation:**

1.  **Input Analysis:**
    *   `iterable`: The input provides a dictionary: `{'rows': 2, 'cols': 2, '_mat': None}`. This dictionary resembles the internal structure of a SymPy `Matrix` but is passed as a raw dictionary object (not an instance of `Matrix`).
    *   `shape`: The input is `None`.

2.  **`_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)`:**
    *   This method is called to parse dimensions and data. It checks the type of `iterable`.
    *   `iterable` is a `dict`. It is **not** an instance of `MatrixBase` (which would trigger logic to copy matrix properties).
    *   `iterable` is **not** an instance of `list`, `tuple`, or `Tuple` (which would trigger flattening and shape inference).
    *   Since `iterable` matches neither of intended array types, `NDimArray` treats it as a scalar element for a 0-rank array (an array containing a single object).
    *   The method returns `shape=()` (empty tuple) and `flat_list=[iterable]` (a list containing the dictionary).

3.  **Sympification and Flattening:**
    *   `shape = Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))`: `shape` becomes `()`.
    *   `flat_list = flatten(flat_list)`: `flatten` (from `sympy.utilities.iterables`) is called on `[{...}]`. Since `dict` is not in the default list of types to flatten (list, tuple, set), `flatten` treats the dictionary as an atomic element. It returns `[{...}]`.
    *   `flat_list = Tuple(*flat_list)`: Converts the list to a SymPy `Tuple`. The dictionary element is sympified (likely to a SymPy `Dict` or kept as is depending on version, but logically contained). `flat_list` is now a tuple containing the valid dictionary.

4.  **Object Creation (`Basic.__new__`):**
    *   `self` is created with arguments `flat_list` and `shape`.

5.  **Attribute Assignment:**
    *   `self._shape` is set to `()`.
    *   `self._array` is set to `list(flat_list)`, which is `[{'rows': 2, 'cols': 2, '_mat': None}]`.
    *   `self._rank` is set to `len(shape)`, which is `0`.
    *   `self._loop_size` is calculated as the product of shape dimensions, which defaults to `1` for empty shape.

**Conclusion:**
The executable treats the input dictionary as a single object (scalar) inside a 0-rank array, rather than interpreting the dictionary keys/values as array dimensions or content.
