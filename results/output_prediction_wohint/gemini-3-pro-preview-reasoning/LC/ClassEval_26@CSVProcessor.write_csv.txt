The logic for the `write_csv` method is as follows:

1.  **Input Parsing**: The method receives `data` which is `[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ['ME']]` and `file_name` which is `"read_test_process.csv"`.
2.  **Try Block Execution**:
    *   `open(file_name, 'w', newline='')`: Attempts to open the file "read_test_process.csv" in write mode. Assuming a standard environment where file writing is permitted, this succeeds.
    *   `writer = csv.writer(file)`: Creates a CSV writer object associated with the file.
    *   `writer.writerows(data)`: Iterates through the `data` list.
        *   Row 1: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` is written.
        *   Row 2: `['ME']` is written.
    *   Since the input data is a valid list of lists containing strings, the `writerows` method executes without raising a `TypeError` or `ValueError`.
3.  **Return Value**: After the `with` block finishes (closing the file), the code proceeds to `return 1`.
4.  **Exception Handling**: Since no errors occurred during file opening or writing, the `except` block is skipped.
