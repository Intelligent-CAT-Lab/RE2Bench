Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `f` is called with `nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.

2.  **Initialization**:
    *   `count = len(nums)` is calculated. The length of the list is 5, so `count = 5`.

3.  **Loop Execution**:
    *   The loop is defined as `for num in range(2, count):`. Since `count` is 5, `range(2, 5)` produces the sequence `[2, 3, 4]`.
    *   **Iteration 1 (`num = 2`)**: Only the code `nums.sort()` is executed. The list `nums` is currently `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`. Sorting this list in ascending order results in `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`. The list is modified in-place (though it remains effectively unchanged because it was already sorted).
    *   **Iteration 2 (`num = 3`)**: `nums.sort()` is executed again. The list remains `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
    *   **Iteration 3 (`num = 4`)**: `nums.sort()` is executed again. The list remains `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.

4.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns the final state of `nums`.

5.  **Final Result**: The list provided in the input was already sorted. The function sorts it three times, resulting in the same list `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
