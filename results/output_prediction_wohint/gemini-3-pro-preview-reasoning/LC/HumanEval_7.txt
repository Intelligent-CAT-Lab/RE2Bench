Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Definition**: The function `filter_by_substring(strings, substring)` takes a list of strings and a target substring. It returns a new list containing only the elements from the original list that contain the target substring.
2.  **Input Data**:
    *   `strings`: `["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]`
    *   `substring`: `"run"`
3.  **Iteration 1**: Check the first string `"grunt"`.
    *   Does `"grunt"` contain `"run"`? Yes, it is the middle part (`g-run-t`).
    *   Action: Include `"grunt"` in the output list.
4.  **Iteration 2**: Check the second string `"trumpet"`.
    *   Does `"trumpet"` contain `"run"`? No.
    *   Action: Do not include in the output.
5.  **Iteration 3**: Check the third string `"prune"`.
    *   Does `"prune"` contain `"run"`? Yes, it is the middle part (`p-run-e`).
    *   Action: Include `"prune"` in the output list.
6.  **Iteration 4**: Check the fourth string `"gruesome"`.
    *   Does `"gruesome"` contain `"run"`? No.
    *   Action: Do not include in the output.
7.  **Final Output**: The collected list is `["grunt", "prune"]`.
