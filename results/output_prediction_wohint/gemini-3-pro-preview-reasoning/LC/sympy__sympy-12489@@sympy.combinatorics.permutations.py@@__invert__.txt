The `__invert__` method (which implements the `~` operator) is called on a `Permutation` object.

1.  **Analyze Input State**: The input `self` object has `_size` equal to 5 and `_array_form` as `null` (None in Python).
2.  **Determine `_array_form`**: The `__invert__` function calls `_af_invert(self._array_form)`. The helper function `_af_invert` typically requires a list representing the permutation array. Passing `None` would raise a `TypeError` in standard execution. However, in the context of `Permutation` objects, if `_array_form` is `None` but `_size` is defined, it most likely represents the Identity permutation (where the array form `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is implied or lazily loaded). Given `_size = 5`, the effective array form is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
3.  **Execute Inversion**: The function calls `_af_invert([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`. The inverse of the Identity permutation is the Identity permutation itself. The result is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4.  **Create New Object**: THe code then calls `self._af_new(...)` with the inverted array. This method creates a new `Permutation` instance, setting its `_array_form` to the passed list and updating its `_size`.
5.  **Construct Output**: The resulting object is a `Permutation` with `_array_form` `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` 5.

[THOUGHT]
The function `__invert__` is called on a `Permutation` object `self`. The input shows `_size` is 5 and `_array_form` is `null`.
The code executes `_af_invert(self._array_form)`. Since `_af_invert` operates on a list to produce an inverse permutation array, `_array_form` is expected to be a list.
In SymPy's `Permutation`, an `_array_form` of `None` combined with a valid `_size` (like 5) often implies the Identity permutation (or a state where the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is generated on demand, though the snippet accesses the attribute directly). We assume valid execution where `self` represents the Identity permutation of size 5.
The Identity permutation of size 5 is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
The inverse of the Identity permutation is itself: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
The method then calls `self._af_new([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`. This creates and returns a new `Permutation` instance with `_array_form` set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` set to 5.
