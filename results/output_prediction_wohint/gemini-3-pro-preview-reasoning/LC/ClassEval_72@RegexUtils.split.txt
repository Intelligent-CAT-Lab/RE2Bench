[THOUGHT]
The function `split` takes a regex pattern and a text string, and uses `re.split` to split the text by the matches of the pattern.

1.  **Pattern Analysis**: The provided pattern is `r"\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b"`.
    *   `\b`: Word boundary.
    *   `\d{3}`: Three digits.
    *   `-`: Hyphen.
    *   `\d{3}`: Three digits.
    *   `-`: Hyphen.
    *   `\d{4}`: Four digits.
    *   `\b`: Word boundary.
    *   Essentially, this matches standard US phone number formats that are distinct words.

2.  **Text Analysis**: The input text is `"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`.

3.  **Matching Process**:
    *   Scanning the text, we find three substrings that match the pattern:
        1.  `"123-456-7890"` (at the very beginning).
        2.  `"876-286-9876"` (in the middle).
        3.  `"987-762-9767"` (at the very end).

4.  **Splitting Process**: `re.split` returns the text *between* the matches.
    *   **Before Match 1**: The first match starts at index 0. Therefore, the first element in the split list is an empty string `""`.
    *   **Between Match 1 and Match 2**: The text between `123-456-7890` and `876-286-9876` is `" abiguygusu "`. Note the leading and trailing spaces.
    *   **Between Match 2 and Match 3**: The text between `876-286-9876` and `987-762-9767` is `" kjgufwycs "`.
    *   **After Match 3**: The last match ends at the end of the string. Therefore, the last element in the split list is an empty string `""`.

5.  **Result**: The resulting list is `["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]`.
