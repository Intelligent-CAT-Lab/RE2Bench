The function `__eq__` compares the current instance (`self`) with another object (`other`).

1.  **Type Check**: The first condition checks if `other.__class__ is self.__class__`.
    *   `self` is an instance of `IndirectReference`.
    *   The input `other` is given as `[1, 2]`, which is a Python `list`.
    *   Since `list` is not `IndirectReference`, `other.__class__ is self.__class__` evaluates to `False`.

2.  **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Since the first operand of the `and` operator is `False`, Python stops evaluating the rest of the expression (short-circuiting). It does not attempt to access `other.object_id` or `other.generation`.

3.  **Return Value**: The function returns `False`.
