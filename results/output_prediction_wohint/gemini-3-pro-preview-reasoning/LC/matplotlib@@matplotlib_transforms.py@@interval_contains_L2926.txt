The function `interval_contains(interval, val)` checks if the value `val` lies within the bounds specified by `interval`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Parse Inputs**:
    *   `interval`: The input string `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"` represents a sequence containing two floating-point numbers. It corresponds to `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]`.
    *   `val`: The value to check is `-80.0`.

2.  **Execution Step 1: Unpacking**:
    *   The line `a, b = interval` unpacks the sequence.
    *   `a` becomes `-107.73502692`.
    *   `b` becomes `-7.73502692`.

3.  **Execution Step 2: Normalization**:
    *   The code checks `if a > b`.
    *   Comparison: `-107.73502692 > -7.73502692`. Since -107 is less than -7, this condition is `False`.
    *   The code inside the `if` block (swapping a and b) is skipped. The interval is already sorted.

4.  **Execution Step 3: Range Check**:
    *   The code returns `a <= val <= b`.
    *   Substitute values: `-107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692`.
    *   First part: `-107.73502692 <= -80.0` is `True`.
    *   Second part: `-80.0 <= -7.73502692` is `True`.
    *   The total expression evaluates to `True`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The function returns the boolean value `True`.
    *   In JSON format, this is represented as `true`.
