[THOUGHT]
The function `setup` is called with a mocked `app` object.
2. The code within `setup` calls `app.add_post_transform` twice to register `ImageDownloader` and `DataURIExtractor`. These are side effects on the `app` object.
3. The function ends by returning a dictionary literal: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.
4. The prediction is simply the JSON representation of this returned dictionary.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
```
