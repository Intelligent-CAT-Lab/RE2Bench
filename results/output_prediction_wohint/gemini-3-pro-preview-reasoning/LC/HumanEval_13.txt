This is a simulation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function with the inputs `a=10` and `b=15`. This function implements the Euclidean algorithm.

1.  **Initialization**: The function is called with `a = 10` and `b = 15`.

2.  **First Iteration (`while b` is True because `15 != 0`)**:
    *   We calculate the tuple `(b, a % b)`.
    *   Current `b` is 15.
    *   Current `a % b` is `10 % 15`, which equals 10.
    *   We assign these values to `a` and `b` respectively.
    *   New state: `a = 15`, `b = 10`.

3.  **Second Iteration (`while b` is True because `10 != 0`)**:
    *   We calculate the tuple `(b, a % b)`.
    *   Current `b` is 10.
    *   Current `a % b` is `15 % 10`, which equals 5.
    *   We assign these values.
    *   New state: `a = 10`, `b = 5`.

4.  **Third Iteration (`while b` is True because `5 != 0`)**:
    *   We calculate the tuple `(b, a % b)`.
    *   Current `b` is 5.
    *   Current `a % b` is `10 % 5`, which equals 0.
    *   We assign these values.
    *   New state: `a = 5`, `b = 0`.

5.  **Loop Termination**:
    *   The condition `while b` is checked. Since `b` is now 0, the loop terminates.

6.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns `a`, which is 5.
