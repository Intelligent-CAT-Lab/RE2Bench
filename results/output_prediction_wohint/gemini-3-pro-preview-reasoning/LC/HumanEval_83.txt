Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `starts_one_ends` is called with the argument `n` set to 5.
2.  The code checks if `n == 1`. Since `5 == 1` is False, the code proceeds to the `return` statement.
3.  The expression to evaluate is `18 * 10 ** (n - 2)`.
4.  First, calculate the exponent: `n - 2` becomes `5 - 2`, which is `3`.
5.  Next, calculate the power: `10 ** 3` equals `1000`.
6.  Finally, perform the multiplication: `18 * 1000`.
7.  The result is `18000`.
