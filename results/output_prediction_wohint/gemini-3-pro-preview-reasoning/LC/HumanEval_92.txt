Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `any_int` is called with arguments `x=2`, `y=1`, and `z=1` extracted from the input JSON.

2.  **Type Checking**:
    *   The code checks `if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int):`.
    *   `x` is 2 (int).
    *   `y` is 1 (int).
    *   `z` is 1 (int).
    *   All are integers, so the condition is `True`, and execution enters the `if` block.

3.  **Value Comparison**:
    *   The code checks `if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x:`.
    *   First part: `x + y == z` => `2 + 1 == 1` => `3 == 1` (False).
    *   Second part: `x + z == y` => `2 + 1 == 1` => `3 == 1` (False).
    *   Third part: `y + z == x` => `1 + 1 == 2` => `2 == 2` (True).
    *   Since the conditions are connected with `or`, and one of them is `True`, the overall condition is `True`.

4.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns `True`.
