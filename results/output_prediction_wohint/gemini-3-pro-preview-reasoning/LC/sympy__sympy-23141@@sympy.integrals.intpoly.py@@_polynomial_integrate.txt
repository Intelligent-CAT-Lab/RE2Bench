To predict the output, I'll simulate the execution of `_polynomial_integrate` with the provided inputs.

**Input Analysis:**
*   `polynomials`: `{"2": "x*y"}`
*   `facets`: `null` (None)
*   `hp_params`: `null` (None)

**Execution Trace:**
1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `dims` is set to `(x, y)` (using SymPy symbols).
    *   `dim_length` = 2.
    *   `integral_value` = `S.Zero` (SymPy Zero).

2.  **Outer Loop (`for deg in polynomials`)**:
    *   The loop iterates over keys of `polynomials`. The key is `"2"`.
    *   *Self-Correction/Assumption*: In Python, iterating over a standard dictionary yields keys. The input JSON provides the key as a string "2". However, the subsequent calculation `dim_length + deg` requires `deg` to be an integer. If `deg` remains a string `"2"`, `2 + "2"` would raise a `TypeError`. For the execution to proceed logically (and typically in SymPy's `intpoly` module), the keys represent degrees and are integers. We assume the input harness or the context treats the key as integer `2`.

3.  **Inner Initialization**:
    *   `poly_contribute` = `S.Zero`.
    *   `facet_count` = 0.

4.  **Inner Loop (`for hp in hp_params`)**:
    *   The input `hp_params` is `null`, which translates to `None` in Python.
    *   A strict execution of `for hp in None:` raises a `TypeError`.
    *   *Assumption*: In the context of automated testing or data capture, `null` often represents an empty list `[]` for iterable arguments or the input capture failed. If we assume the code is meant to run without crashing, `hp_params` should be treated as an empty list `[]`.
    *   If `hp_params` is `[]`: The loop body is skipped.

5.  **Post-Inner Loop Calculation**:
    *   `poly_contribute` (which is 0) is divided by `dim_length + deg` (2 + 2 = 4).
    *   `poly_contribute` remains 0.
    *   `integral_value` += `poly_contribute` sums to 0.

6.  **Completion**:
    *   The outer loop finishes.
    *   The function returns `integral_value`.

**Result**:
The calculated `integral_value` is `S.Zero` (0). Since the input lists defining the geometry (`facets`, `hp_params`) are empty (null), the integration domain is effectively empty or undefined, resulting in an integral of 0.
