[THOUGHT]
The `total` method calculates the sum of the cost for each item in the cart by multiplying its quantity by its price. Iterate through the items in the input list: the first item contributes 200.0 (10 * 20.0) and the second item contributes 50.0 (5 * 10.0). Summing these values results in a total of 250.0.
