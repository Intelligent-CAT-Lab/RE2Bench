The user wants me to execute the Python function `is_equal_to_sum_even` with the argument `n=10`.

**Step 1: Parse the input.**
From the input JSON, the argument `n` is set to `10`.

**Step 2: Analyze the function logic.**
The function code is:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```
This function returns a boolean value based on two conditions combined with a logical `and` operator.

**Step 3: Evaluate the first condition `n % 2 == 0`.**
- `n` is 10.
- `10 % 2` calculates the remainder of 10 divided by 2.
- Since 10 is an even number, the remainder is `0`.
- The condition `0 == 0` is `True`.

**Step 4: Evaluate the second condition `n >= 8`.**
- `n` is 10.
- We check if 10 is greater than or equal to 8.
- 10 is indeed greater than 8.
- The condition is `True`.

**Step 5: Combine results.**
- The expression is `True and True`.
- The result is `True`.
