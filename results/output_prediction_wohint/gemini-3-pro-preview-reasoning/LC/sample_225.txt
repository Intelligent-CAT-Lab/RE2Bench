Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `f` is called with the argument `text` set to the string `"54882"`.
2.  The code checks the condition `if text.islower():`.
3.  The string method `islower()` returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character.
4.  The input string `"54882"` consists solely of numeric digits. It does not contain any cased characters (letters).
5.  Because there are no cased characters, the requirement "at least one cased character" is not met along with the casing check. Consequently, `"54882".islower()` evaluates to `False`.
6.  The `if` block is skipped.
7.  The execution reaches the statement `return False`.
