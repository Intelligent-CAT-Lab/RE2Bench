The user wants to predict the output of the static method `__format_line_feed` within the `HtmlUtil` class.

**Step-by-step execution:**

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    -   The function is `HtmlUtil.__format_line_feed`.
    -   The argument `text` is `"Some sentence here."`.

2.  **Function Logic**:
    -   The code executes `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)`.
    -   `re.compile('\\n+')`: This compiles a regular expression that matches one or more newline characters (`\n`). In Python string literals, `\\n` resolves to `\n`, which the regex engine interprets as the newline character.
    -   `re.sub(..., '\n', text)`: This replaces all sequences of one or more newlines with a single newline character.

3.  **Processing the Input**:
    -   The input string is `"Some sentence here."`.
    -   The string contains alphanumeric characters, spaces, and punctuation.
    -   It does **not** contain any newline characters (`\n`).

4.  **Result**:
    -   The regular expression does not find any matches in the string.
    -   Therefore, no substitutions are performed.
    -   The function returns the original string unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
