[THOUGHT]
The code performs a rounding operation based on specific rules or prints the integer part, with a special case for numbers where the integer part ends in 9.

1.  **Input Parsing**: The input string is `"2.4"`.
    The line `num = input().split('.')` splits the string at the decimal point.
    `num` becomes `['2', '4']`. `num[0]` is `'2'` and `num[1]` is `'4'`.

2.  **First Condition**: `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
    *   `num[0]` is `'2'`.
    *   `num[0][-1]` takes the last character of `'2'`, which is `'2'`.
    *   `int('2')` results in `2`.
    *   The condition `2 == 9` evaluates to `False`. The code moves to the `elif` block.

3.  **Second Condition**: `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
    *   `num[1]` is `'4'`.
    *   `num[1][0]` takes the first character of `'4'`, which is `'4'`.
    *   `int('4')` results in `4`.
    *   The condition `4 >= 5` evaluates to `False`. The code moves to the `else` block.

4.  **Else Block**:
    *   `print(num[0])` is executed.
    *   `num[0]` holds the value `'2'`.

5.  **Final Output**: The code prints `2`.
