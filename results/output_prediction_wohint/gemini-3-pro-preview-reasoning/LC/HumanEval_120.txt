I'll follow the execution of the `maximum` function with the provided inputs.

**1. Variable Initialization:**
The function is called with the following arguments:
- `arr`: `[-4, 4]`
- `k`: `2`

**2. Check Condition:**
The first line checks `if k == 0:`.
Since `k` is `2`, this condition is false, and execution moves to the next line.

**3. Sorting:**
The line `arr.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order.
The input list `[-4, 4]` is already in ascending order (-4 is less than 4).
After this step, `arr` remains `[-4, 4]`.

**4. Slicing:**
The line `ans = arr[-k:]` creates a slice of the list.
Here, `k` is `2`. So the operation is `arr[-2:]`.
Negative indexing in Python slices from the end of the list.
- `arr[-1]` is `4`.
- `arr[-2]` is `-4`.
Since the length of the list is 2, `arr[-2:]` essentially means taking the last 2 elements, which comprises the entire list starting from index 0.
Thus, `ans` evaluates to `[-4, 4]`.

**5. Return:**
The function returns `ans`.
Return value: `[-4, 4]`.

    "output": [
        -4,
        4
