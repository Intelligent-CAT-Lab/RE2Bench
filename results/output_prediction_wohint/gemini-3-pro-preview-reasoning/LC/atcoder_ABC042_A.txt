Based on the provided Python code and input, here is the step-by-step execution and predicted output:

[THOUGHT]
1. **Understand the Goal**: The code reads a line of input, expects space-separated integers, and checks specific conditions regarding the count of the number `5` and the sum of the numbers.
2. **Analyze the Input**: The input JSON provides the string `"\"7 5 5\""`. Although the JSON value includes escaped quotes (implying the string literal `"7 5 5"`), in the context of this logic (which performs arithmetic), it is assumed the input to the program is the sequence of identifiers `7 5 5`.
3. **Execution - Step 1 (Input & Parse)**:
    - `input().split()` reads the string `7 5 5` and splits it by whitespace into the list `['7', '5', '5']`.
    - `map(int, ...)` converts these string elements into integers `7`, `5`, and `5`.
    - `tuple(...)` creates the tuple `ABC = (7, 5, 5)`.
4. **Execution - Step 2 (First Condition)**:
    - The code checks `if ABC.count(5) == 2:`.
    - In the tuple `(7, 5, 5)`, the integer `5` appears twice.
    - The condition `2 == 2` is `True`.
5. **Execution - Step 3 (Second Condition)**:
    - Inside the `if` block, the code executes `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')`.
    - `sum(ABC)` calculates `7 + 5 + 5`, which equals `17`.
    - The condition `sum(ABC) == 17` checks `17 == 17`, which is `True`.
6. **Execution - Step 4 (Output)**:
    - Since the condition is true, the ternary operator selects `'YES'`.
    - The program prints `YES`.
