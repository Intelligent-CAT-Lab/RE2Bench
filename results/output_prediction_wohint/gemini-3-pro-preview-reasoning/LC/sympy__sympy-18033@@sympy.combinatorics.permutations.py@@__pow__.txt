[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `__pow__` method for the `Permutation` class.

1.  **Analyze the Input State**:
    *   The `self` object is a `Permutation`.
    *   Attributes provided: `_array_form` is `null`, `_cyclic_form` is `null`, `_size` is `7`.
    *   In the context of the SymPy logic (from which this code is derived), if a Permutation has `_size` set but both forms are `None`, it typically represents the Identity permutation of that size.
    *   Therefore, the property `self.array_form` (referenced in the code but not shown explicitly) will return `list(range(7))`, which is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
    *    The argument `n` is `-2`.

2.  **Execute `__pow__`**:
    *   `n = int(n)` results in `-2`.
    *   The code calls `_af_pow(self.array_form, n)`.
    *   `self.array_form` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (Identity).
    *   Mathematically, raising the Identity permutation to any power (including negative ones) results in the Identity permutation. $I^{-2} = (I^{-1})^2 = I^2 = I$.
    *   So, `_af_pow` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

3.  **Create Result Object**:
    *   The code calls `self._af_new(...)` with the result list.
    *   `_af_new` (aliased to `Perm._af_new`) is a constructor method. It creates a new `Permutation` instance, sets its `_array_form` to the provided list, and sets `_size` to the length of the list.
    *   Looking at standard behavior for such constructors, `_cyclic_form` remains `None` (null) until needed.

4.  **Construct Output JSON**:
    *   The function returns the new Permutation object.
    *   Its `_array_form` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
    *   Its `_size` is `7`.
    *   Its `_cyclic_form` is `null`.
