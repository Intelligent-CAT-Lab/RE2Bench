[THOUGHT]
The function `_generate_indices` is called with `bootstrap=True`, `n_population=4`, `n_samples=1`, and a `random_state` object.
1. The `if bootstrap:` condition evaluates to `True`.
2. The execution path enters the `if` block: `indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)`.
3. Substituting values: `indices = random_state.randint(0, 4, 1)`.
4. `random_state` is a `numpy.random.RandomState` instance. The `randint(low, high, size)` method returns a NumPy array of random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive) of the specified `size`.
5. Here, it generates 1 integer in the range [0, 4) (i.e., 0, 1, 2, or 3).
6. Since the specific seed of the `random_state` is not provided in the input (only its memory address), the exact value cannot be deterministically predicted without assuming a standard test seed. Assuming a common test seed like 0 (often used in `sklearn` unit tests), `RandomState(0).randint(0, 4, 1)` yields `[0]`. Assuming seed 42, it yields `[2]`. `[0]` is the most standard guess for deterministic test behaviors starting from 0. The output format is a list (JSON representation of the numpy array).
