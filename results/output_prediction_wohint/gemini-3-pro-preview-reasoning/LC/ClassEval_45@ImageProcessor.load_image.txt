The function `load_image` updates the internal state of the `ImageProcessor` instance by loading an image from the specified path into `self.image`. However, the function definition does not contain a `return` statement. In Python, if a function does not return a value explicitly, it implicitly returns `None`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `load_image` takes `image_path` as an argument.
It executes the line `self.image = Image.open(image_path)`. This opens the image file and assigns the resulting `Image` object to `self.image`.
The function does not have a `return` statement.
Therefore, the function returns `None` after execution.
In the expected JSON output format, `None` is represented as `null`.
