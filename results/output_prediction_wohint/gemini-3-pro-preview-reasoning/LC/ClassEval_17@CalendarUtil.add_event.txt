For this function, we need to determine the return value of the `add_event` method.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The input JSON specifies that the `CalendarUtil` instance (`self`) currently has an attribute `events` which is a list containing one dictionary:
    ```python
    self.events = [
        {
            "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
            ...
            "description": "New Year"
        }
    ]
    ```

2.  **Analyze the Execution**: The method `add_event` is called with an argument `event`:
    ```python
    event = {
        "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
        ...
        "description": "New Year"
    }
    ```
    The code for the method is:
    ```python
    def add_event(self, event):
        self.events.append(event)
    ```
    This appends the provided dictionary to the `self.events` list. The list will now contain two elements.

3.  **Determine the Return Value**: The `add_event` method does not have an explicit `return` statement. In Python, if a function reaches the end of its execution without hitting a `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None`.

4.  **Format the Output**: The requested output format is JSON. The Python value `None` corresponds to `null` in JSON.

Therefore, the output of the function execution is `null`.
