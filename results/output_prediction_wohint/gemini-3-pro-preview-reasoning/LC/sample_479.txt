Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `f` is called with `nums=[1, 2, 3]`, `pop1=2`, and `pop2=4`.
2.  **First Operation**: Execute `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)`.
    *   `pop1` is 2, so `pop1 - 1` is `1`.
    *   We call `nums.pop(1)`. The element at index 1 in `[1, 2, 3]` is `2`.
    *   `2` is removed from the list.
    *   The list `nums` becomes `[1, 3]`. The indices are now 0 (value 1) and 1 (value 3).
3.  **Second Operation**: Execute `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)`.
    *   `pop2` is 4, so `pop2 - 1` is `3`.
    *   We call `nums.pop(3)`.
    *   The current list `[1, 3]` has a length of 2. The valid indices are 0 and 1.
    *   Index 3 is strictly out of bounds.
4.  **Result**: The method raises an `IndexError` because the index to pop is out of the valid range of the list. The execution stops here, and no value is returned.
