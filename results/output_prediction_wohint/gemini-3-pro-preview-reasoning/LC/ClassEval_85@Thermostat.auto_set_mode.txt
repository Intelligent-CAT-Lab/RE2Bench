The execution of the `auto_set_mode` function is simulated as follows:

1.  **Initialization**: The `Thermostat` instance is initialized with:
    *   `current_temperature = 25`
    *   `target_temperature = 25`
    *   `mode = 'cool'`

2.  **Method Call**: `auto_set_mode()` is called.

3.  **Condition Check**: The code executes the `if` statement:
    ```python
    if self.current_temperature < self.target_temperature:
    ```
    Substituting the values: `25 < 25`. This expression evaluates to `False`.

4.  **Else Block**: Since the condition is `False`, the execution moves to the `else` block:
    ```python
    else:
        self.mode = 'cool'
    ```
    The attribute `self.mode` is set to `'cool'`. It was already `'cool'`, so the value remains the same.

5.  **Return**: The function reaches the end of execution. Since there is no `return` statement, Python implicitly returns `None`.
