The code filters the input list `[-1, -3, -5, -6, 0]` into separate lists for negative and positive integers. All negative numbers are collected, and their maximum value (`-1`) is determined. Since zero is neither strictly positive nor negative based on the conditions provided, the list of positive integers is empty, resulting in `None` for the second value.
