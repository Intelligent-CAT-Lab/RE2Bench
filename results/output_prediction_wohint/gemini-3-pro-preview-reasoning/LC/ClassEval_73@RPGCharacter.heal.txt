[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize State**: The object is initialized with attributes provided in the "self" dictionary of the input. Specifically, `self.hp` is 100.
2.  **Execute `heal` method**:
    *   `self.hp += 10`: The current `hp` is 100. Adding 10 results in `self.hp` becoming 110.
    *   `if self.hp > 100:`: Check the condition $110 > 100$. This evaluates to `True`.
    *   `self.hp = 100`: Since the condition is true, `self.hp` is reset to 100 (capping the health).
    *   `return self.hp`: The method returns the current value of `self.hp`, which is 100.
