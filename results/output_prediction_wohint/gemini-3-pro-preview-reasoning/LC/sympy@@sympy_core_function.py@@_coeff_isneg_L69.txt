[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the function `_coeff_isneg` with the input `a = "cos(2*phi)/2"`.

1.  **Input Interpretation**: The string "cos(2*phi)/2" represents a SymPy expression. In SymPy, division by a number is represented as multiplication by the reciprocal. So, the expression is equivalent to `(1/2) * cos(2*phi)`.

2.  **Object Structure**:
    *   The object `a` is an instance of `sympy.core.mul.Mul` because it involves multiplication of the scalar `1/2` and the function `cos(2*phi)`.
    *   The internal arguments of a `Mul` object in SymPy are sorted such that numeric coefficients come first. Thus, `a.args` is `(1/2, cos(2*phi))` (where `1/2` is a `Rational` or `Float` number).

3.  **Execution Trace**:
    *   The function `_coeff_isneg(a)` is called.
    *   `if a.is_MatMul:`: The expression is a scalar multiplication, not a matrix multiplication. This is `False`.
    *   `if a.is_Mul:`: The expression is a `Mul`. This is `True`.
    *   Inside the `if` block: `a = a.args[0]`.
        *   Accessing `args[0]` of `(1/2, cos(2*phi))` yields `1/2`.
        *   Now, `a` is the number `1/2`.
    *   `return a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative`:
        *   `a.is_Number`: `1/2` is a symbolic number (Rational). This is `True`.
        *   `a.is_extended_negative`: This checks if the number is strictly less than zero. `1/2` is positive. This is `False`.
    *   The boolean expression evaluates to `True and False`, which is `False`.

4.  **Conclusion**: The function returns `False`.
