Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Initialization**: The function `f` is called with the argument `array = []` (an empty list).

2.  **First Loop Execution**: `while -1 in array:`
    *   The condition checks if the value `-1` exists in the list `[]`.
    *   Since the list is empty, `-1` is not found.
    *   The loop condition evaluates to `False`, so the loop body (`array.pop(-3)`) is skipped.

3.  **Second Loop Execution**: `while 0 in array:`
    *   The condition checks if the value `0` exists in the list `[]`.
    *   Since the list is empty, `0` is not found.
    *   The loop condition evaluates to `False`, so the loop body (`array.pop()`) is skipped.

4.  **Third Loop Execution**: `while 1 in array:`
    *   The condition checks if the value `1` exists in the list `[]`.
    *   Since the list is empty, `1` is not found.
    *   The loop condition evaluates to `False`, so the loop body (`array.pop(0)`) is skipped.

5.  **Return Statement**: `return array`
    *   The variable `array` has not been modified and remains `[]`.
    *   The function returns `[]`.
