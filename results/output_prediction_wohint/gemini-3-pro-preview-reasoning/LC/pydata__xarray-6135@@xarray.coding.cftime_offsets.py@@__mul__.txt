The function `__mul__` is called on an instance of `QuarterOffset`.

1.  **Initial State**:
    *   `self` is a `QuarterOffset` object with attributes `n=1` and `month=2`.
    *   The argument `other` is passed as `-1`.

2.  **Execution of `__mul__`**:
    *   The code checks `if isinstance(other, float):`. Since `other` is `-1` (an integer), this condition evaluates to `False`.
    *   The code proceeds to the return statement: `return type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)`.

3.  **Calculation**:
    *   `other * self.n` is calculated: `-1 * 1` equals `-1`.
    *   `self.month` is retrieved: `2`.
    *   `type(self)` is `QuarterOffset`.
    *   A new instance of `QuarterOffset` is initialized with `n=-1` and `month=2`.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The method returns this new object.

[THOUGHT]
The `__mul__` method is triggered with `self` having `n=1`, `month=2` and `other` being `-1`.
The check `isinstance(other, float)` is false.
To construct the return value, `type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)` is executed.
`n` becomes `-1 * 1 = -1`.
`month` remains `2`.
A new object of the same type is returned with these attributes.

    "n": -1,
