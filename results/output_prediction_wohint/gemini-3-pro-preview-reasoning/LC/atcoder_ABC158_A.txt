Let's simulate the execution of the code step by step.

1.  **Input Reading**: The code executes `stdin = input()`. The provided input in the JSON structure is `\"BBA\"`. In JSON format, the escaped quotes `\"` indicate that the double quote character is part of the string value. Therefore, the string read from input is literally `"BBA"` (including the double quotes).
    
2.  **Variable Assignment**: The variable `s` is assigned the value `"BBA"`.

3.  **Condition Check**: The code executes the conditional expression: `'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'`.
    *   It checks `'A' in s`. The string `"BBA"` contains the character 'A' (at the end). This evaluates to `True`.
    *   It checks `'B' in s`. The string `"BBA"` contains the character 'B'. This evaluates to `True`.
    *   Since both conditions are `True`, the expression evaluates to `True`.

4.  **Result Evaluation**: Because the condition is true, `result` is assigned the value `'Yes'`.

5.  **Output**: The processing ends with `print(result)`, which outputs `Yes`.
