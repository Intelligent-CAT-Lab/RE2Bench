[THOUGHT]
The function `gf_rem` is called with arguments `f=[2, 0]`, `g=[1, 0, 1]`, `p=3`, and `K="ZZ"`.
`gf_rem` delegates to `gf_div(f, g, p, K)` and returns the remainder (the second element of the returned tuple).

Inside `gf_div`:
1.  **Calculate Degrees**:
    *   `df = gf_degree(f)`: `f` is `[2, 0]`. The leading coefficient is 2 (non-zero). The degree is `len(f) - 1` = 1.
    *   `dg = gf_degree(g)`: `g` is `[1, 0, 1]`. The leading coefficient is 1 (non-zero). The degree is `len(g) - 1` = 2.
2.  **Check Degrees Condition**:
    *   The code checks `elif df < dg:`.
    *   Here, $1 < 2$ is True.
3.  **Return**:
    *   The function executes `return [], f`. The quotient is empty (0), and the remainder is the dividend itself `f`.

The `gf_rem` function receives the tuple `([], [2, 0])` and returns index 1, which is `[2, 0]`.
