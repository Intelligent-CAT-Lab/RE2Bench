The user wants the output of the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class.

1.  **Initialization**: An instance of `SQLGenerator` is created with `table_name="table1"`.
2.  **Method Call**: The `select` method is called.
    *   `args` is empty.
    *   `kwargs` contains `condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
    *   Based on the signature `def select(self, fields=None, condition=None)`, `fields` is `None` (default) and `condition` is `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.

3.  **Execution Trace**:
    *   **Fields Handling**:
        *   The code checks `if fields is None:`. Since `fields` is passed as `None` (default), this block is executed.
        *   `fields` is set to `'*'`.
    *   **Base SQL Construction**:
        *   `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
        *   Substituting the values: `fields='*'`, `self.table_name='table1'`.
        *   `sql` becomes `"SELECT * FROM table1"`.
    *   **Condition Handling**:
        *   The code checks `if condition is not None:`. The `condition` is `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
        *   `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
        *   `sql` becomes `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
    *   **Return**:
        *   `return sql + ';'`
        *   The final string is `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`.

4.  **Final Output Formulation**: The output is a JSON object containing the result string.
