[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
1. The input `nums` is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
2. The function calculates the length of `nums`, which is 7.
3. The loop `for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):` iterates `7 - 1 = 6` times.
4. Inside the loop, `nums.reverse()` reverses the list in place.
5. Reversing a list acts as a toggle:
   - Reversing it once changes the order.
   - Reversing it a second time restores the original order.
6. Since the loop runs 6 times (an even number), the list will be reversed and then restored 3 times (pairs of reversals cancel each other out).
   - Iteration 1 starts with Original -> Ends with Reversed.
   - Iteration 2 starts with Reversed -> Ends with Original.
   - ...
   - Iteration 6 (Even) starts with Reversed -> Ends with Original.
7. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `nums` is in its original order: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
8. The function returns `nums`.
