The user wants to predict the output of the `subtract` method in the `ComplexCalculator` class.

**1. Analyze the Input and Context:**
- The input JSON specifies arguments for the method `subtract`.
- `c1` is given as `"(-1+2j)"`.
- `c2` is given as `"(-3+4j)"`.
- These inputs are strings in the JSON, but the method logic, specifically accessing `.real` and `.imag`, implies that these arguments are treated as Python `complex` objects during execution.
- We interpret `c1` as the complex number $-1 + 2i$ and `c2` as $-3 + 4i$.

**2. Step-by-Step Execution:**
- **Retrieve properties of `c1`**:
  - `c1.real` = $-1.0$
  - `c1.imag` = $2.0$
- **Retrieve properties of `c2`**:
  - `c2.real` = $-3.0$
  - `c2.imag` = $4.0$
- **Calculate `real` variable**:
  - The code executes: `real = c1.real - c2.real`
  - Substitution: `real = -1.0 - (-3.0)`
  - Calculation: `real = -1.0 + 3.0 = 2.0`
- **Calculate `imaginary` variable**:
  - The code executes: `imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag`
  - Substitution: `imaginary = 2.0 - 4.0`
  - Calculation: `imaginary = -2.0`
- **Return result**:
  - The code returns: `complex(real, imaginary)`
  - Substitution: `complex(2.0, -2.0)`
  - This results in the complex number object representing $2 - 2i$.

**3. Format the Output:**
- Python's string representation of the complex number `complex(2, -2)` is `(2-2j)`. Since the input was provided as a string representation of a complex number (likely due to JSON limitations), the output should be presented similarly.

[THOUGHT]
1. The `subtract` method is a static method taking two arguments `c1` and `c2`.
2. The input JSON provides `c1` as `"(-1+2j)"` and `c2` as `"(-3+4j)"`. Since the code accesses `c1.real` and `c1.imag`, these inputs are treated as Python complex number objects: `c1 = complex(-1, 2)` and `c2 = complex(-3, 4)`.
3. Evaluate `c1.real - c2.real`: `-1.0 - (-3.0) = 2.0`.
4. Evaluate `c1.imag - c2.imag`: `2.0 - 4.0 = -2.0`.
5. The function returns `complex(2.0, -2.0)`.
6. The string representation of this complex number is `(2-2j)`.
