Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `x = int(input())`: The code reads the input value "1" from the standard input. The `int()` function converts this string into the integer `1`. So, `x` becomes `1`.
2. `if x == 1:`: The code checks if the value of `x` is equal to 1. Since `x` is 1, this condition evaluates to `True`.
3. `print(0)`: Because the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed. It prints `0` to the standard output.
