The function `restify` is called with the argument `cls` set to `None` (parsed from the JSON input `null`).

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Function Entry**: The function `restify(cls)` is called with `cls = None`.
2.  **Imports**: `from sphinx.util import inspect` is executed. This is a local import and is assumed to succeed.
3.  **Condition Check**: The code enters the `try` block and evaluates the first condition: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`.
    *   `cls` is `None`.
    *   `NoneType` is defined in the global scope as `type(None)`.
    *   The expression `cls is None` evaluates to `True`.
4.  **Return**: The function executes the return statement inside the `if` block: `return ':py:obj:`None`'`.
5.  **Result**: The function returns the string literal `':py:obj:`None`'`. The execution terminates here, ignoring the rest of the logic.
