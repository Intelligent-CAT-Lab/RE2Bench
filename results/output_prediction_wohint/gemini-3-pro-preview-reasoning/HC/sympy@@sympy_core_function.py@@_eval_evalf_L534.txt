The execution of `_eval_evalf` with `prec=30` proceeds as follows:

1.  **Determine Function to Call (`func`)**:
    The code checks for `_eval_mpmath` on `self`. The provided "Functions called during the execution" list includes `sympy.sympy.functions.special.beta_functions._eval_mpmath`. This implies that `self` is an instance of a class that has this method (likely `betainc` from `beta_functions.py`), or `_eval_mpmath` was successfully retrieved.
    The `_eval_mpmath` method returns a tuple: `(betainc_mpmath_fix, (*self.args, S(1)))`.
    Thus, `func` is `betainc_mpmath_fix`.

2.  **Determine Arguments (`args`)**:
    The `args` variable becomes `tuple(self.args) + (S(1),)`. `S(1)` corresponds to `Integer(1)`, which acts as the `reg` (regularized) argument for `betainc_mpmath_fix` (since it accepts `a, b, x1, x2, reg=0`).
    Although `self.args` is not explicitly shown in the JSON `self` dictionary (which only shows `nargs`), the execution trace involving `betainc_mpmath_fix` and `_from_mpmath` (creating a Float) implies that the function call succeeds.
    The function `betainc_mpmath_fix` (provided in the code snippets) has specific logic: `if x1 == x2: return mpf(0)`. This handles the singularity/definition where the integration range is zero. Given that `nargs` is shown as `{1}` (which is anomalous for `betainc` which requires 4 arguments), but the trace highlights the "fix" function, this strongly suggests the test case targets the `x1 == x2` path (e.g., `betainc(a, b, x, x)`) which returns 0. If `x1 != x2`, it would call `mpmath.betainc`, which isn't explicitly listed as a separate Python function definition block (only imported). The presence of the "fix" wrapper implies its logic is relevant.
    Thus, `func(*args)` returns `mpmath.mpf(0)`.

3.  **Evaluate and Return**:
    The result `v` (which is `mpf(0)`) is passed to `Expr._from_mpmath(v, prec)`.
    `expr._from_mpmath` calls `Float._new(v._mpf_, prec)`.
    With `prec=30` (binary precision), a new `Float` is created with `_mpf_=(0, 0, 0, 0)` and `_prec=30`.

The output is the JSON representation of this `Float` object.
