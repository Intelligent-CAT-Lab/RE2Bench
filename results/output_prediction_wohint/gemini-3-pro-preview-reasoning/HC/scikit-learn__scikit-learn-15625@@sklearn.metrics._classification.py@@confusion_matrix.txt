[THOUGHT]
1.  **Parse Inputs**:
    The input `y_true` and `y_pred` are provided as strings representing numpy arrays: `"[0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]"`.
    Parsing this sequence into a list/array:
    Values: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
    Length: 20.
    Counting the values:
    - Zeros (`0`): 9 occurrences.
    - Ones (`1`): 11 occurrences.
    Both `y_true` and `y_pred` are identical.

2.  **Function Call - `confusion_matrix`**:
    -   `labels` is `None`.
    -   `sample_weight` is `None`.
    -   `normalize` is `None`.

3.  **Trace Constraints and Validation (`_check_targets`)**:
    -   `check_consistent_length`: Both inputs have length 20. Pass.
    -   `type_of_target`: Both arrays contain integers `0` and `1`. The number of unique values is 2. The type is determined as `'binary'`.
    -   Combined type check: `{'binary'}`. Supported.
    -   Returns `y_type='binary'`, and the arrays.

4.  **Label Processing**:
    -   Since `labels` is `None`, `unique_labels` is called.
    -   It finds sorted unique values from `y_true` and `y_pred`: `[0, 1]`.
    -   `n_labels` = 2.
    -   `label_to_ind` mapping: `{0: 0, 1: 1}`.
    -   `y_true` and `y_pred` are mapped to indices. Since they are already 0 and 1, they remain unchanged: `[0, 1, 1, ...]` and `[0, 1, 1, ...]`.

5.  **Sample Weight**:
    -   defaults to an array of ones with length 20 and dtype `int64`.

6.  **Matrix Construction**:
    -   The code builds a coordinate matrix (COO) from the weights at coordinates `(y_true, y_pred)`.
    -   Since `y_true` is identical to `y_pred`:
        -   All entries where values are `0` map to coordinate `(0, 0)`.
        -   All entries where values are `1` map to coordinate `(1, 1)`.
        -   No entries map to `(0, 1)` or `(1, 0)`.
    -   Accumulated weights for `(0, 0)`: The count of zeros in the input (9).
    -   Accumulated weights for `(1, 1)`: The count of ones in the input (11).
    -   The result `cm` is a 2x2 dense array:
        ```python
        [[9, 0],
         [0, 11]]
        ```

7.  **Finalization**:
    -   `normalize` is `None`, so `cm` is returned as integers.
