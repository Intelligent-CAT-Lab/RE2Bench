The function `get_integer_part` calculates the integer part of a symbolic expression, potentially acting as `floor` or `ceiling` operations depending on the `no` parameter (1 typically for ceiling-like behavior with `round_nearest`, -1 for floor-like behavior).

1.  **Expression Analysis**: The input expression is `expr = 5*sqrt(42949673)`.
    *   Let $N = 5 \sqrt{42949673} = \sqrt{25 \times 42949673} = \sqrt{1073741825}$.
    *   We observe that $32768^2 = (2^{15})^2 = 2^{30} = 1073741824$.
    *   Therefore, the expression represents $\sqrt{1073741824 + 1}$.
    *   Since $\sqrt{x^2 + 1} > x$ for $x > 0$, the value is strictly greater than 32768.
    *   Since it is the square root of $(32768^2 + 1)$, it is very close to 32768, certainly much less than 32769 ($32769^2 \approx 1073807361$).
    *   So, $32768 < \text{expr} < 32769$.

2.  **`get_integer_part` Execution**:
    *   `evalf(expr, 30, options)` is called. With 30 bits of precision (which is roughly 9 decimal digits, and $32768$ requires 15 bits, leaving 15 bits for fractional part), the value $\approx 32768.000015$ is computed.
    *   The `calc_part` internal function is called for the real part.
    *   `to_int(nexpr, rnd)` uses `round_nearest`.
    *   $32768.000015...$ rounds to nearest integer $32768$. So `nint` = 32768.
    *   The code calculates the residuum: `expr - nint`. In symbolic arithmetic, this is $5\sqrt{42949673} - 32768$.
    *   It evaluates this residuum with `evalf` again (checking against 0). Since the expression is strictly slightly larger than 32768, the residuum `x` is positive ($> 0$).
    *   The comparison `mpf_cmp(x, fzero)` returns `1` (positive).
    *   The adjustment line is `nint += int(no * (mpf_cmp(x, fzero) == no))`.
    *   The input parameter `no` is 1.
    *   The condition is `1 == 1`, which is True (1).
    *   `nint` is incremented by `1 * 1`.
    *   `nint` becomes $32768 + 1 = 32769$.

3.  **Imaginary Part**:
    *   The expression is purely real, so the imaginary part loop handles `None`/Zero and results in 0.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The function returns `(32769, 0)`.
