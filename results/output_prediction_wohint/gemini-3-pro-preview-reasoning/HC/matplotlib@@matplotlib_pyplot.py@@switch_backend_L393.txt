To predict the output of `switch_backend("Agg")`, we simulate the execution step by step:

1.  **Function Call**: `switch_backend(newbackend="Agg")` is called.
2.  **Sentinel Check**: The code checks `if newbackend is rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel`. The input string "Agg" is not the sentinel object. This block is skipped.
3.  **Load Backend**: 
    - `old_backend` is retrieved (though unused in the subsequent logic provided).
    - `backend_registry.load_backend_module("Agg")` is called. This imports the module for the Agg backend (typically `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg`).
4.  **Backend Validation**:
    - `canvas_class` is retrieved from the module.
    - `required_framework` for Agg is typically `None` (it's non-interactive). The check `if required_framework is not None` is skipped.
5.  **Proxy Module Creation**:
    - `new_figure_manager` and `show` are looked up in the module. For Agg, `show` is often `None` or a no-op, and modern backends use `FigureCanvas.new_manager`.
    - A `backend_mod` class is defined, populating its locals with the module's dictionary.
6.  **Function Definition**:
    - Since `new_figure_manager` is likely `None` in the raw module (relying on canvas), the code defines shim functions (`new_figure_manager`, `draw_if_interactive`, etc.) and attaches them to `backend_mod`.
    - Returns logic handles `show`: If `show` is missing, it looks up `manager_class.pyplot_show`. Agg's manager class supports this. `backend_mod.show` is set.
7.  **Global Updates**:
    - `rcParams['backend']` and `rcParamsDefault['backend']` are updated to "Agg".
    - The global `_backend_mod` is updated.
    - Global functions (`new_figure_manager`, `draw_if_interactive`, `show`) in the current module scope have their signatures updated to match the backend's implementation.
    - `matplotlib.backends.backend` is set to "Agg".
8.  **Hooks**: `install_repl_displayhook()` is called. It attempts to register IPython hooks. Assuming a standard environment or simulation where this succeeds or returns (no exception raised).
9.  **Return**: The function reaches the end of execution without a return statement, implicitly returning `None`.
