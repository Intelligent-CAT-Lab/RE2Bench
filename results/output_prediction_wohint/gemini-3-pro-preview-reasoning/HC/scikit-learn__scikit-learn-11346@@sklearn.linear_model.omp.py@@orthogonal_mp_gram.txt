The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` performs Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) using a precomputed Gram matrix and the target vector (or covariance vector) `Xy`.

**Trace:**
1.  **Initialization**:
    -   `Gram` is a 12x12 matrix (correlations between dictionary atoms). The diagonal elements are 1.0 (normalized).
    -   `Xy` is a 12x1 vector (correlations between dictionary atoms and the signal).
    -   `n_nonzero_coefs` is set to 1. This means the algorithm will run for exactly 1 iteration (selecting 1 atom).
    -   `tol` is `None`, so tolerance-based stopping is disabled.
    -   `coef` is initialized as a zero matrix of shape (12, 1).

2.  **Iteration LOOP (k=0)**:
    -   We call `_gram_omp` for the single target column `Xy[:, 0]`.

3.  **Inside `_gram_omp`**:
    -   `n_active` = 0.
    -   We find the index `lam` that maximizes `abs(alpha)`, where `alpha` starts as `Xy`.
    -   Let's check the absolute values of `Xy`:
        -   Index 0: 0.8899
        -   Index 1: **2.3325** (Maximum)
        -   Index 2: 0.1396
        -   ...
        -   Index 9: 1.6836 (2nd highest magnitude)
        -   ...
    -   The maximum is at index 1 with value `2.33249979`. So `lam = 1`.
    -   Premature stop checks pass.
    -   **Cholesky Update**: Since `n_active` is 0, we compute `L[0, 0] = sqrt(Gram[lam, lam])`.
        -   `Gram[1, 1]` is 1.0.
        -   `L[0, 0] = 1.0`.
    -   **Swapping**: The function swaps index 0 and index 1 in `Gram`, `indices`, and `Xy`. `indices` now starts with `[1, 0, ...]`. `Xy[0]` is now `2.33249979`.
    -   **Solve for gamma**: Solve `L * L.T * gamma = Xy_active`.
        -   `1.0 * 1.0 * gamma = 2.33249979`.
        -   `gamma = [2.33249979]`.
    -   **Update Residual**: `beta = Gram[:, :1] * gamma`. `alpha = Xy - beta`. (Used for next iteration selection).
    -   `n_active` becomes 1.
    -   **Stopping Condition**: `n_active == max_features` (which is `n_nonzero_coefs` = 1). The loop breaks.

4.  **Return from `_gram_omp`**:
    -   Returns `gamma` (coefficient values), `indices` (active indices), `n_active`.
    -   `gamma` = `[2.33249979]`.
    -   `indices[:1]` = `[1]`.

5.  **Constructing Result**:
    -   Back in `orthogonal_mp_gram`, `coef` (12x1 zeros) is updated.
    -   `coef[indices[0], 0] = gamma[0]` => `coef[1, 0] = 2.33249979`.
    -   The function returns `np.squeeze(coef)`.
    -   The result is a 1D numpy array of size 12. All elements are 0.0 except index 1 which is ~2.3325.

6.  **Output Format**:
    -   The inputs were provided as strings representing numpy arrays. The output will likely be the string representation of the resulting numpy array.
