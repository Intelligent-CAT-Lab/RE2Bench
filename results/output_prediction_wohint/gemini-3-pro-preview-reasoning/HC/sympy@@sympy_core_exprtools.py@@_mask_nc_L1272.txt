The function to be executed is `_mask_nc`, defined in the second Python code block.

**Input Analysis:**
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `eq`: "2 - 2*cos(phi)"
    *   `name`: `null` (which translates to `None` in Python)
*   **Context:** `_mask_nc` is designed to process SymPy expressions, specifically to handle non-commutative parts. The input "2 - 2*cos(phi)" represents a SymPy expression: $2 - 2\cos(\phi)$.

**Execution Trace:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `name` is passed as `None`, so `name` is set to `'mask'` (Line 6).
    *   Helper functions `numbered_names` and `Dummy` are defined (Lines 8-16).
    *   `expr` is assigned the value of `eq`, which is the expression $2 - 2\cos(\phi)$ (Line 17).

2.  **Commutativity Check:**
    *   The code checks `if expr.is_commutative:` (Line 18).
    *   The expression consists of:
        *   Integers ($2$, $-2$): Commutative.
        *   Symbol $\phi$: In SymPy, symbols are commutative by default (unless defined with `commutative=False`). The input does not specify otherwise.
        *   Function `cos`: Standard trigonometric functions of commutative arguments are commutative.
    *   Since all components are commutative, `expr.is_commutative` returns `True`.

3.  **Early Return:**
    *   The condition is met, so the function executes the return statement (Line 19): `return (eq, {}, [])`.
    *   It returns the original expression, an empty dictionary (for replacements), and an empty list (for non-commutative symbols).

4.  **Skipped Logic:**
    *   The code block handling non-commutative traversals (`preorder_traversal`, `subs`, etc.) is skipped entirely.

**Output Construction:**
The function returns a tuple `(expr, dict, list)`. In JSON format, this corresponds to a list containing the string representation of the expression, an empty object, and an empty array.
