The function `Equivalent.__new__` constructs a new `Equivalent` object. This class represents the logical equivalence of its arguments.

**Execution Simulation:**

1.  **Inputs**:
    *   `cls`: `Equivalent`
    *   `evaluate`: `None` (which defaults to `global_parameters.evaluate`, typically `True`).
    *   `args`: Two symbolic expressions representing predicates.
        *   `A`: `"Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)"` (Logical OR of two predicates)
        *   `B`: `"Q.even(X*Z)"` (Predicate applied to a product)

2.  **Steps in `__new__`**:
    *   The arguments are sympified using `_sympify`. Assuming standard SymPy environment, these become:
        *   `A`: `Or(Q.even(X), Q.even(Z))`
        *   `B`: `Q.even(X*Z)`
    *   `argset = set(args)`: The set containing both expressions is created.
    *   The code iterates through `argset` to check for `Relational` objects. Neither `A` nor `B` are instances of `Relational` (they are `OR` and `AppliedPredicate` respectively). Thus, the simplification logic involving `.canonical` and `.negated` is skipped.
    *   The loop for `remove` (simplification of pairs) is skipped.
    *   The cleanup loops (removing `True`/`False`) are skipped as neither argument is a boolean constant.
    *   `len(argset)` is 2, so the check `len(argset) <= 1` fails.
    *   Checks for `True`/`False` in `argset` fail.
    *   The function calls `super().__new__(cls, *ordered(argset))`. This constructs the `Equivalent` object with the arguments sorted.

3.  **Sorting with `ordered`**:
    *   `ordered` sorts based on `_nodes` (complexity/size of the expression tree) and then `default_sort_key`.
    *   `B` (`Q.even(X*Z)`):
        *   Tree: `AppliedPredicate` -> `Mul` -> `(Symbol(X), Symbol(Z))`.
        *   Approximate node count: 1 (Predicate) + 1 (Mul) + 2 (Symbols) = 4.
    *   `A` (`Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`):
        *   Tree: `Or` -> `(AppliedPredicate -> Symbol(X), AppliedPredicate -> Symbol(Z))`.
        *   Approximate node count: 1 (Or) + 2 (Predicates) + 2 (Symbols) = 5.
    *   Since 4 < 5, `Q.even(X*Z)` is considered "smaller" and comes first.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The function returns an instance of `Equivalent` with arguments `[Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)]`.
    *   We predict the output as a JSON object describing the returned SymPy object.
