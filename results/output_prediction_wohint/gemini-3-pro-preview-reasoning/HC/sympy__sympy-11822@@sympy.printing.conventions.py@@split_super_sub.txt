The function `split_super_sub` is designed to parse a string `text` into a main name, superscripts (preceded by `^` or `__`), and subscripts (preceded by `_`). It also moves trailing digits from the main name into the subscripts list.

**Execution Simulation:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `text` is `"Fvec"`.
    *   `len(text)` is 4, which is not 0.
    *   `pos` = 0, `name` = None, `supers` = [], `subs` = [].

2.  **Parsing Loop (`while pos < len(text)`):**
    *   **Iteration 1**:
        *   `pos` is 0.
        *   `start` = `pos + 1` = 1.
        *   `text[0:2]` is `"Fv"`, not `"__"`.
        *   `pos_hat` (location of `^` starting from index 1) -> Not found (-1), set to `len(text)` (4).
        *   `pos_usc` (location of `_` starting from index 1) -> Not found (-1), set to `len(text)` (4).
        *   `pos_next` = `min(4, 4)` = 4.
        *   `part` = `text[0:4]` = `"Fvec"`.
        *   `pos` is updated to 4.
        *   `name` is `None`, so `name` becomes `"Fvec"`.

3.  **Check Condition**: `pos` (4) is not less than `len(text)` (4). The loop terminates.

4.  **Trailing Digits Check**:
    *   `_name_with_digits_p` is compiled with regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`.
    *   `m = _name_with_digits_p.match("Fvec")`.
    *   The regex expects letters followed immediately by one or more digits. Since `"Fvec"` contains no digits, the match fails (`m` is None).

5.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns the tuple `(name, supers, subs)`.
    *   Values: `("Fvec", [], [])`.

[THOUGHT]
The function iterates through the input string "Fvec" to identify separators `_` (subscript) or `^`/`__` (superscript).
1. Initializing variables: `pos=0`, `name=None`, lists are empty.
2. In the loop, searching for `^` or `_` starting from index 1. None are found in "Fvec", so `pos_next` becomes the length of the string (4).
3. The chunk "Fvec" is extracted. Since `name` is None, `name` is set to "Fvec". `pos` becomes 4, loop terminates.
4. The code checks if `name` matches the regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`. This regex requires trailing digits. "Fvec" has no digits, so no match found. No changes to `name` or `subs`.
5. Returns `("Fvec", [], [])`.
