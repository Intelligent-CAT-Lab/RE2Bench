The execution of `world_to_pixel_values` proceeds as follows:

[THOUGHT]
1.  **State Analysis**:
    *   The `self` object is an instance of `SlicedLowLevelWCS`.
    *   Its attribute `_slices_pixel` is set to `null` (`None`) in the input.
    *   Its underlying WCS `_wcs` has `naxis` = 3.
    *   The method is called with no arguments (`args` is empty `{}`).

2.  **Step-by-Step Execution**:
    *   The method `world_to_pixel_values` is entered.
    *   The first line calls `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`.
    *   `self._pixel_keep` is `[0, 1]`, so the length is 2. The call becomes `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`.
    *   Inside `_pixel_to_world_values_all`:
        *   `pixel_arrays` is converted to numpy arrays of `0`.
        *   It iterates `ipix` over `range(self._wcs.pixel_n_dim)`.
        *   `self._wcs.pixel_n_dim` corresponds to `naxis`, which is 3.
        *   The loop starts with `ipix = 0`.
        *   The code attempts to access `self._slices_pixel[ipix]`: `if isinstance(self._slices_pixel[ipix], numbers.Integral):`.
        *   Since `self._slices_pixel` is `None`, the subscription `[0]` fails.

3.  **Result**:
    *   A `TypeError` is raised: `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`.

    *(Note: If `_slices_pixel` were populated, the function would subsequently fail with an `IndexError` because `args` implies empty `world_arrays`, but the method expects arrays for the kept world dimensions (0 and 1). However, the `TypeError` occurs first.)*
