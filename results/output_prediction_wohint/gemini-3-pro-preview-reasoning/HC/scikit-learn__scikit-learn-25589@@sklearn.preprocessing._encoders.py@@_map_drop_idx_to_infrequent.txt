The execution of the `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` method in the `OneHotEncoder` class is simulated as follows:

1.  **Initialize State (`self`):**
    The `self` object is populated from the input JSON. Key attributes are:
    *   `_infrequent_enabled`: `False` (from `"_infrequent_enabled": false`)
    *   `param`: `categories`='auto', `drop`=None, etc.

2.  **Identify Arguments (`args`):**
    The method is called with:
    *   `feature_idx`: `1` (integer)
    *   `drop_idx`: `"0"` (string, as provided in the input JSON)

3.  **Execute Method Logic (`_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent`):**
    *   Code: `if not self._infrequent_enabled:`
    *   Evaluation: `self._infrequent_enabled` is `False`. So `not self._infrequent_enabled` is `True`.
    *   Code: `return drop_idx`
    *   Action: The method returns the `drop_idx` argument exactly as received.

4.  **Determine Return Value:**
    *   The input `drop_idx` is the string `"0"`.
    *   Therefore, the return value is the string `"0"`.
