The function `create_method` creates a wrapper function `manager_method` around the passed `method` using `functools.wraps(method)`.

The `functools.wraps` decorator (via `update_wrapper`) sets the `__wrapped__` attribute on the wrapper function to point to the original `method`. This attribute is stored in the function's `__dict__`.

Based on the previous example where a `Path` object was serialized to `{"strpath": ...}` (reflecting its `__dict__` content), the serializer likely outputs the `__dict__` of the returned object.

For the returned `manager_method` function:
1.  Its `__dict__` contains `{'__wrapped__': method}`.
2.  The input `method` is represented as `{}` in the JSON format.
3.  Therefore, the output representation will be `{"__wrapped__": {}}`.

    "__wrapped__": {}
