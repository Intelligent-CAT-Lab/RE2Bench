The `fit_predict` method in the `DBSCAN` class performs clustering on the provided data `X` given `eps=0.5` and `min_samples=5`. Since `sample_weight` is provided, the `min_samples` threshold applies to the sum of weights of the neighbors (including the point itself).

**Step-by-step Execution:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `eps` = 0.5
    *   `min_samples` = 5
    *   `metric` = 'euclidean'
    *   `p` = None (Euclidean implies p=2)
    *   `sample_weight`: Provided array.

2.  **Fitting (`fit` method implied call)**:
    *   **Neighbors Search**: Calculate all neighbors within distance 0.5 for each point in `X`.
    *   **Core Point Identification**: For each point, calculate the `weighted_n_neighbors` by summing the `sample_weight` of all points in its neighborhood (including itself).
    *   If `weighted_n_neighbors >= 5`, the point is a **Core Point**.
    *   **Clustering (DBSCAN inner loop)**:
        *   Iterate through points. If a point is a Core Point and not yet visited, start a new cluster.
        *   Expand the cluster by visiting all reachable neighbors.

3.  **Trace on Data**:
    *   **Group 1 (Indices 0-19)**: Visually centered around (11.0-11.7, 10.6-11.9).
        *   Most points are dense and have sufficient cumulative weight.
        *   **Cluster ID: 0**.
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 10 `[9.97, 11.26]`: Far from the main group (nearest is > 1.0 away). Weight 3 < 5. **Noise (-1)**.
            *   Index 16 `[10.64, 10.21]`: Far from main group. Weight 3 < 5. **Noise (-1)**.
    *   **Group 2 (Indices 20-39)**: Visually centered around (8.7, 8.8).
        *   Dense cluster.
        *   **Cluster ID: 1** (Found after Cluster 0).
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 21 `[8.31, 9.78]`: Distance to nearest (Index 23) is ~0.503 > 0.5. Isolated. Weight 4 < 5. **Noise (-1)**.
        *   Note: Points like 23 and 33 have weight 0, but they are neighbors of core points (like 25 and 24), so they belong to the cluster.
    *   **Group 3 (Indices 40-59)**: Visually centered around (11.0, 9.3).
        *   Most points are dense.
        *   **Cluster ID: 2** (Found after Cluster 1).
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 41 `[11.18, 8.38]` and Index 53 `[10.83, 8.70]` are close to each other (~0.47 dist) but far from others. Sum of their weights (0 + 4) = 4 < 5. They do not form a core. **Noise (-1)**.
            *   Index 50 `[11.75, 8.46]`: Isolated from the main group. Weight 3 < 5. **Noise (-1)**.

4.  **Result Construction**:
    *   Construct the labels array based on the indices identified above.
    *   Indices 0-9: `0`
    *   Index 10: `-1`
    *   Indices 11-15: `0`
    *   Index 16: `-1`
    *   Indices 17-19: `0`
    *   Index 20: `1`
    *   Index 21: `-1`
    *   Indices 22-39: `1`
    *   Index 40: `2`
    *   Index 41: `-1`
    *   Indices 42-49: `2`
    *   Index 50: `-1`
    *   Indices 51-52: `2`
    *   Index 53: `-1`
    *   Indices 54-59: `2`
