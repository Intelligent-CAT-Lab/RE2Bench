The function `exptrigsimp` is designed to simplify expressions involving exponentials and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions by trying various rewrites and selecting the one with the fewest operations (`count_ops`).

1.  **Input Parsing**: The input expression is `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`.
2.  **Step 1: `bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)`**:
    *   The `bottom_up` function applies `exp_trig` to the expression tree from leaves to root.
    *   For the leaf `x`, `exp_trig` returns `x`.
    *   For the nodes `sinh(x)` and `cosh(x)`:
        *   Rewriting `sinh(x)` to exponentials yields `(exp(x) - exp(-x))/2`. `count_ops` for `sinh(x)` is 1, while for the exponential form it is significantly higher (5 ops: Div, Sub, Exp, Exp, Neg). Thus, `sinh(x)` is retained. Similarly, `cosh(x)` is retained.
    *   For the root node `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`:
        *   `exp_trig` compares the original expression with its rewrites.
        *   `rewrite(exp)` is called.
            *   `sinh(x)` becomes `exp(x)/2 - exp(-x)/2`.
            *   `cosh(x)` becomes `exp(x)/2 + exp(-x)/2`.
            *   The sum is `(exp(x)/2 - exp(-x)/2) + (exp(x)/2 + exp(-x)/2)`. The `exp(-x)/2` terms cancel out, and `exp(x)/2 + exp(x)/2` simplifies to `exp(x)`.
        *   `count_ops(exp(x))` is **1** (just the `exp` function).
        *   `count_ops(sinh(x) + cosh(x))` is **3** (`sinh`, `cosh`, `Add`).
        *   Since 1 < 3, `exp_trig` selects `exp(x)`.
    *   The expression `newexpr` becomes `exp(x)`.
3.  **Step 2: `bottom_up(newexpr, f)`**:
    *   The function `f` performs simplifications on `Mul` objects (products).
    *   `newexpr` is `exp(x)`, which is an instance of `exp` (or `Pow`), not `Mul`.
    *   Therefore, `f` returns `exp(x)` unchanged.
4.  **Step 3: Post-processing**:
    *   `newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction)` is False (`exp` is not hyperbolic).
    *   `newexpr.has(TrigonometricFunction)` is False.
    *   `newexpr` does not contain `I` (imaginary unit), so the final check passes.
5.  **Return**: The function returns `exp(x)`.
