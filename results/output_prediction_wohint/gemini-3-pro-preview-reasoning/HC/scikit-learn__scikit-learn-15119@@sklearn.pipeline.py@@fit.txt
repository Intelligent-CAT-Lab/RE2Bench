The execution of the `fit` method on the `FeatureUnion` instance proceeds as follows:

1.  **Method Call**: The `fit` method is called on a `FeatureUnion` object. The input state (`self`) specifies `"transformer_list": null`, which translates to `None` in Python. The method receives `X` (a 2D array) and `y` (a 1D array) along with a keyword argument `a=0` in `kwargs`.

2.  **Inside `fit`**:
    *   The method calls `self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one)` (Line 56). `fit_params` contains `{'a': 0}`.

3.  **Inside `_parallel_func`**:
    *   The first operation (Line 81) is `self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)`.
    *   The specific instance attribute `self.transformer_list` is `None` (derived from the input JSON `null`).
    *   The builtin function `list()` is called with `None` as the argument.
    *   `list(None)` raises a `TypeError` because `NoneType` is not iterable.

4.  **Termination**: The program raises an unhandled `TypeError` at this point and terminates execution. It does not return `self` or any calculated value. 

    *Note: Even if `transformer_list` were interpreted as an empty list `[]`, the subsequent call to `self._validate_transformers()` would fail on `names, transformers = zip(*self.transformer_list)` because `zip(*[])` yields nothing, causing a `ValueError` when attempting to unpack into two variables. However, the `TypeError` happens first.*
