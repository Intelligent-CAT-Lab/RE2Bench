The function `match_submerged_margins(layoutgrids, fig)` is designed to adjust margins in a constrained layout such that subplots spanning multiple rows or columns have consistent internal margins with those that do not.

Here is the step-by-step execution analysis:

1.  **Inputs**:
    *   `layoutgrids`: A dictionary containing layout information. It includes keys for distinct grids. One key is `"GridSpec(1, 2)"`.
    *   `fig`: A Figure object, described as `"<Figure size 1000x500 with 2 Axes>"`. This implies a figure containing 2 axes. The associated GridSpec is `(1, 2)` (1 row, 2 columns).

2.  **Function Initialization**:
    *   `axsdone = []`
    *   The code iterates over `fig.subfigs`. The input description does not indicate subfigures (it mentions axes directly on the figure), so this loop is skipped (or effectively empty recursion).
    *   The code collects `axs`. It retrieves axes from the figure that have a `subplotspec`, are in the layout, and are not in `axsdone`. The input indicates 2 Axes exist. Let's call them `ax1` and `ax2`. `axs = [ax1, ax2]`.

3.  **Processing Loop**:
    The code iterates through each axis in `axs`.

    *   **Processing `ax1`**:
        *   It retrieves the subplotspec `ss1`. Assuming standard layout on a `GridSpec(1, 2)`, `ax1` occupies the first cell (row 0, col 0).
        *   Check: `ss1.get_gridspec()` corresponds to `GridSpec(1, 2)`, which exists in `layoutgrids`.
        *   **Colspan Check**: `ss1.colspan` refers to the columns spanned. For a single cell in a 2-column grid, the span covers 1 column (e.g., column index 0). The length of `ss1.colspan` is 1.
        *   Condition `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1:` evaluates to `False`. The logic to match submerged left/right margins is skipped.
        *   **Rowspan Check**: `ss1.rowspan` refers to rows spanned. The grid has only 1 row. `ax1` spans row 0. The length is 1.
        *   Condition `if len(ss1.rowspan) > 1:` evaluates to `False`. The logic to match submerged top/bottom margins is skipped.

    *   **Processing `ax2`**:
        *   Subplotspec `ss1` likely corresponds to the second cell (row 0, col 1).
        *   Check: GridSpec matches.
        *   **Colspan Check**: Spans column 1. Length is 1. `if len > 1`: `False`.
        *   **Rowspan Check**: Spans row 0. Length is 1. `if len > 1`: `False`.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The loop finishes.
    *   The function returns the list `axs`.
    *   The value of `axs` is the list `[ax1, ax2]`.

The function performs checks but assumes no modifications are needed because no axis spans multiple columns or rows in this configuration. The output is the list of axes processed. As the input simulates the objects, the output will represent the list of `AxesSubplot` objects.
