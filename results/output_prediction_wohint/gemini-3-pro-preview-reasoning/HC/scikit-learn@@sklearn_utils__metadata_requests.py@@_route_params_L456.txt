The `MethodMetadataRequest._route_params` method processes input parameters (`params`) based on the requested metadata configuration (`self._requests`) to separate validated/requested parameters from unrequested ones, checking for warnings or errors along the way.

**Step-by-step Execution:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   The method is called with `params = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}`, `parent`, and `caller`.
    *   `self._requests` is `{"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}`.

2.  **`_check_warnings`**:
    *   This method iterates over `params` and checks if any parameter corresponds to an entry in `self._requests` with a value of `WARN`.
    *   In `self._requests`, both values are `True`. `True` is not equal to `WARN`.
    *   No warnings are issued.

3.  **Argument Filtering**:
    *   `unrequested` is initialized as an empty dict.
    *   `args` is created by filtering `params` for non-None values. Both `"sample_weight"` and `"metadata"` are not None.
        `args = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}`.
    *   `res` (a `Bunch` object, acting as a dictionary) is initialized.

4.  **Routing Logic (Loop over `_requests`)**:
    The code iterates through `self._requests` items:
    *   **Item 1**: `prop = "sample_weight"`, `alias = True`.
        *   Checks `alias is False or alias == WARN` -> False.
        *   Checks `alias is True and prop in args`: `True` is True, and `"sample_weight"` is in `args`.
        *   **Action**: `res["sample_weight"]` is set to `args["sample_weight"]` (which is `[1]`).

    *   **Item 2**: `prop = "metadata"`, `alias = True`.
        *   Checks `alias is True and prop in args`: `True` is True, and `"metadata"` is in `args`.
        *   **Action**: `res["metadata"]` is set to `args["metadata"]` (which is `"a"`).

5.  **Unrequested Check**:
    *   Wait, the loop iterates *only* over `self._requests`. It places matching items into `res` or `unrequested`.
    *   Wait, `unrequested` logic within the loop:
        ```python
        elif alias is None and prop in args:
             unrequested[prop] = args[prop]
        ```
    *   Since `alias` is `True` for both, nothing goes into `unrequested` via the loop.
    *   The code snippet provided handles `unrequested` items if they are in `_requests` with `alias=None`.
    *   What if a param is in `params` but NOT in `_requests`? The loop iterates over `_requests`. Parameters in `params` that are not in `_requests` are ignored by this specific loop. However, usually, `_route_params` is designed to handle parameters known to the metadata routing system. If `params` contains extra keys not in `_requests`, they are effectively dropped in this implementation of `_route_params` shown (since the loop is driven by `_requests`). However, looking at the provided snippet:
        `args` contains all params.
        The loop only iterates `_requests`.
        If there were keys in `args` not in `_requests`, they wouldn't be processed here.
        With the given input, every key in `params` is in `_requests`.

6.  **Return**:
    *   `unrequested` is empty, so no error is raised.
    *   The method returns `res`.

**Final Result**:
`res` is a Bunch containing:
`sample_weight`: `[1]`
`metadata`: `"a"`
