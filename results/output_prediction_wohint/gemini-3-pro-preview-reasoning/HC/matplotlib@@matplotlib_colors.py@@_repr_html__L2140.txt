[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `_repr_html_` method for a `BivarColormap` object initialized with specific state.

1.  **Analyze the Input State**:
    The input JSON defines the instance (`self`) state:
    *   `_isinit`: `false`
    *   `patch`: A numpy array-like string of shape (65, 65, 3). (Note: `patch` is not a standard attribute referenced in the provided code, but might be suspended state or data intended for initialization).
    *   `name`: "BiCone"
    *   `N`, `M`: 256
    *   `_rgba_bad`, `_rgba_outside`: Colors defined.
    *   `_shape`: "circle"

2.  **Trace Execution of `_repr_html_`**:
    *   The method `_repr_html_` is called.
    *   Line 80: `png_bytes = self._repr_png_()` is called.

3.  **Trace Execution of `_repr_png_`**:
    *   Line 54: `def _repr_png_(self):`
    *   Line 56: `if not self._isinit: self._init()` is NOT present in `_repr_png_` in the provided [PYTHON] block for the class (it is present in the "Functions called" snippet, but that snippet shows `_repr_png_` logic matching the class method mostly? Wait, the "Functions called" snippet shows:
      ```python
      def _repr_png_(self):
          if not self._isinit:
              self._init()
          pixels = self.lut
      ```
      The [PYTHON] block implementation for the class `BivarColormap`:
      ```python
      def _repr_png_(self):
          if not self._isinit:
              self._init()
          pixels = self.lut
      ```
      So `_repr_png_` checks `_isinit` first.
    *   Input `_isinit` is `false`.
    *   Execution enters the `if` block: called `self._init()`.

4.  **Trace Execution of `_init`**:
    *   The method is defined as:
        ```python
        def _init(self):
            raise NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')
        ```
    *   The method raises `NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')`.

5.  **Conclusion**:
    The execution flow hits an exception immediately because the object is not initialized (`_isinit` is False) and the base class implementation of `_init` raises `NotImplementedError`. There is no provided subclass code to override `_init`, and no exception handling in `_repr_png_` or `_repr_html_` to catch it.
    
    (Self-Correction/Verification): Even if `_repr_png_` skipped the explicit `_init` check (as the property `lut` also has it), accessing `self.lut` would trigger the same check and result in the same error. Trying to predict the HTML string is impossible anyway because `_repr_png_` generates a PNG image (binary data compressed with zlib), and its base64 representation cannot be mentally calculated from a raw pixel array. This strongly suggests the expected result is the exception that occurs before any image processing logic.
