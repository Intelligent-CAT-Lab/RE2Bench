The `resolve_gui_or_backend` method is called with `gui_or_backend="no-such-name"`.

1.  **Normalization**: The input string `"no-such-name"` does not satisfy `startswith('module://')`, so it is converted to lowercase (it is already lowercase).
2.  **Check as GUI Identifier**: The method `backend_for_gui_framework("no-such-name")` is called.
    *   This method looks up `"no-such-name"` in `self._GUI_FRAMEWORK_TO_BACKEND`.
    *   The provided keys are 'gtk3', 'gtk4', 'headless', 'macosx', 'qt', 'st5', 'qt6', 'tk', 'wx'.
    *   `"no-such-name"` is not found, so it returns `None`.
3.  **Check as Backend Identifier**: Since the GUI check failed (`backend` is `None`), the code enters the `try` block and calls `self.resolve_backend("no-such-name")`.
    *   Inside `resolve_backend`:
        *   It normalizes input to lowercase.
        *   It checks `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (standard backends like 'agg', 'qt5agg', etc.). `"no-such-name"` is not found.
        *   It checks `_backend_to_gui_framework` (currently empty via input). `"no-such-name"` is not found.
        *   `gui` is `None`.
        *   Variable `_loaded_entry_points` is `False`, so it calls `_ensure_entry_points_loaded()`. This would scan for installed packages via `importlib`. Assuming standard environment behavior where no package named "no-such-name" is installed, no new entry is added for it.
        *   It checks `_backend_to_gui_framework` again. `"no-such-name"` is still not found.
        *   `gui` remains `None`.
        *   It raises `RuntimeError("'no-such-name' is not a recognised backend name")`.
4.  **Exception Handling**: The `RuntimeError` raised by `resolve_backend` is caught by the `except Exception:` block in `resolve_gui_or_backend`.
5.  **Re-raising**: The `except` block raises a new `RuntimeError` with the message `f"'{gui_or_backend}' is not a recognised GUI loop or backend name"`.
