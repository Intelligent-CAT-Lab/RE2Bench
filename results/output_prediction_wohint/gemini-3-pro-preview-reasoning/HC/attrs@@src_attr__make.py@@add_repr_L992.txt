To determine the output of the function `add_repr`, we simulate the execution of the method `_ClassBuilder.add_repr` with the provided inputs.

**Step-by-step Derivation:**

1.  **Understand the Inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `_ClassBuilder`, represented in the input as `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`. This string representation likely serves as an identifier or a serialized form of the object for this test case.
    *   `ns`: The value is `None`.

2.  **Function Logic (`add_repr`):**
    ```python
    def add_repr(self, ns):
        script, globs = _make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns)

        def _attach_repr(cls_dict, globs):
            cls_dict['__repr__'] = self._add_method_dunders(globs['__repr__'])
        self._script_snippets.append((script, globs, _attach_repr))
        self._repr_added = True
        return self
    ```

3.  **Trace Execution:**
    *   **Snippet Generation:** The method calls `_make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns)`. `ns` is `None`. This function (provided in the context) generates the Python source code for a `__repr__` method based on the class attributes (`self._attrs`). While we don't know the specific content of `self._attrs` from the input string `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`, this step calculates the `script` and `globs` required for generating the method.
    *   **Define Attachment:** A closure `_attach_repr` is defined to add the generated `__repr__` to the class dictionary later.
    *   **Update State (`self`):**
        *   The tuple `(script, globs, _attach_repr)` is appended to `self._script_snippets`.
        *   The flag `self._repr_added` is set to `True`.
    *   **Return:** The method returns `self`. This is a common pattern in builder classes to allow method chaining (e.g., `builder.add_repr().add_slots()`).

4.  **Determine Output:**
    *   The return value is the `self` object instance.
    *   The input represented `self` as `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`.
    *   Since the function returns the exact same object instance, and the input representation is a simplified string rather than a state dictionary, the output representation should match the input representation.

[THOUGHT]
The function `add_repr` is called on a `_ClassBuilder` object.
The inputs are:
- `self`: `<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>`
- `ns`: `None`

Inside `add_repr`:
1. `_make_repr_script` is called to generate the code for `__repr__`.
2. A new tuple is appended to `self._script_snippets`.
3. `self._repr_added` is set to `True`.
4. The method returns `self`.

The method returns the `self` object itself (fluent interface). Since the input represents `self` as the string `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"` and the return value is that same object, the output should be that string.
