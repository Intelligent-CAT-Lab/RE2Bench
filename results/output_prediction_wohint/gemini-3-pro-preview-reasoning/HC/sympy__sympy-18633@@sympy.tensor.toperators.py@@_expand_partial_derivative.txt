The execution of `_expand_partial_derivative` involves the following steps:
1.  **Contract Indices**: It calls `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`.
    *   This function prepares the arguments for differentiation. It calculates `indices`, `free` indices, and `dummy` indices.
    *   The trace shows calls to `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices`, `TensorIndex` creation (`Symbol.__new__`), and `Tensor` creation. This indicates that the method successfully processes tensors and indices, likely contracting indices between the expression and the derivation variables (e.g., matching a covariant index in the variable with a contravariant index in the expression).
    *   This step creates a new `PartialDerivative` object `obj` with these contracted/standardized properties.

2.  **Check for Zero Result**: It checks `if not args[0].free_symbols:`.
    *   `args[0]` corresponds to the expression being differentiated (`self.expr`).
    *   The trace shows usage of `Symbol.free_symbols` and `Basic.free_symbols`, implying that `free_symbols` was accessed.
    *   If `args[0]` contained a complicated tensor expression that survived the check, we would expect to see further logic for `TensMul` or `TensAdd` if expansion was required, or simply returning `obj` if not.
    *   However, the trace specifically shows the setup infrastructure (`Tensor`, `Index`, `Symbol` creation) but lacks the extensive calls associated with expanding a `TensMul` (product rule) or `TensAdd` (sum rule) or handling the result recursively.
    *   The absence of `TensMul` or `TensAdd` expansion methods suggests two possibilities: either the expression is a single term (and returned as is), or it evaluates the base case where the derivative is `S.Zero` (derivative of a constant).
    *   Given the ambiguity of the input values (missing `_args`) and the robustness of "derivative of a constant is 0" as a test case that exercises the setup code (hence the trace) but exits early, `S.Zero` is the most probable prediction. A derivative of a term with no free symbols relative to the differentiation variables is 0.

3.  **Output Generation**:
    *   If the result is `S.Zero`, the output representation is typically `0`.
