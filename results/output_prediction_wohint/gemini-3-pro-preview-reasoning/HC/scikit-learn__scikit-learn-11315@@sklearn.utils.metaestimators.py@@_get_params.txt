The function execution proceeds as follows:

1.  **Call to `_get_params`**: The method `_get_params` is called on an instance (likely of `ColumnTransformer`, inheriting from `_BaseComposition`) with `attr='_transformers'` and `deep=False`.

2.  **Super `get_params`**:
    *   The first line `out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)` invokes `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=False)`.
    *   **Retrieving Parameter Names**: `BaseEstimator.get_params` calls `_get_param_names`. This method typically inspects the `__init__` signature of the class. Based on the attributes provided in the `self` dictionary, which correspond to the standard arguments for a `ColumnTransformer`, the parameters are `n_jobs`, `remainder`, `transformer_weights`, and `transformers`.
    *   **Constructing Dictionary**: The function iterates over these keys and retrieves their values from `self`.
        *   `n_jobs`: 1
        *   `remainder`: "passthrough"
        *   `transformer_weights`: None (represented as `null` in JSON)
        *   `transformers`: None (represented as `null` in JSON)
    *   Since `deep=False`, the method does not traverse into sub-estimators. It returns the dictionary `out`.

3.  **Deep check**:
    *   Back in `_get_params`, the code checks `if not deep:`.
    *   Since `deep` is `False`, this condition is true.
    *   The function returns `out` immediately. The subsequent logic involving `getattr(self, attr)` (which would trigger the `_transformers` property) is skipped.
