The function `args_cnc(self, **kwargs)` is called on a `MatMul` instance `self` with `kwargs={'cset': True}`.

1.  **Analyze Input State**:
    The input defines `"self": {}`. In the context of SymPy objects (which store arguments in `_args` via `__slots__`), an empty dictionary representation typically implies either a missing state or an empty state. Assuming the valid object state compatible with the provided `self` is a `MatMul` with no arguments (which effectively represents an Identity matrix, though usually flattened to `1` by `__new__`, we treat it as an instance of `MatMul` with `self.args = ()` for the purpose of method execution if checking against `MatMul` class).

2.  **Execute `as_coeff_matrices`**:
    The method `self.as_coeff_matrices()` is called.
    -   `scalars = [x for x in self.args if not x.is_Matrix]` -> `[]` (since args is empty).
    -   `matrices = [x for x in self.args if x.is_Matrix]` -> `[]`.
    -   `coeff = Mul(*scalars)` -> `Mul(*[])` evaluates to `S.One` (1).
    -   Returns `(1, [])`.

3.  **Execute `coeff.args_cnc`**:
    The code calls `coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)` where `coeff` is `1` and `kwargs` is `{'cset': True}`.
    -   `Expr.args_cnc` (inherited by `Integer`/`Mul`) is executed for `1`.
    -   `1` is not a `Mul`. `args` is `[1]`.
    -   `1` is commutative. The commutative part `c` initialized as `[1]`.
    -   `split_1` is True (default), but `1` is positive, so it remains `[1]`.
    -   `cset` is True, so `c` is converted to a set: `{1}`.
    -   Method returns `({1}, [])`.

4.  **Process Result in `MatMul.args_cnc`**:
    -   `coeff_c` is `{1}`.
    -   `coeff_nc` is `[]`.
    -   The condition `if coeff_c == [1]:` is False (set vs list).
    -   The condition `elif coeff_c == set([1]):` is checked. `{1} == {1}` is **True**.
    -   `coeff_c` is updated to `set()`.
    -   The return statement is `(coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)`.
    -   `coeff_nc + matrices` -> `[] + []` -> `[]`.
    -   Returns `(set(), [])`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    The return value is a tuple containing an empty set and an empty list. In JSON, an empty set is represented as an empty list (or similarly empty collection).
    Output: `[[], []]`.
