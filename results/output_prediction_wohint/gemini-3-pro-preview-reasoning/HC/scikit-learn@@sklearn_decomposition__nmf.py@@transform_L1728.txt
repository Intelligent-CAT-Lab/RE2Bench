The `transform` method of the `NMF` class projects the data matrix `X` onto the fitted components `H` (stored in `self.components_`) to find the weights `W` such that $X \approx WH$, minimizing the residual error subject to non-negativity constraints ($W \ge 0$). This is equivalent to solving a Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) problem for each row of `X` against the components `H`.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  **Validation**: `validate_data` validates `X` (input array of shape 6x5). All data is non-negative and shape is consistent with `n_features_in_=5`.
2.  **Fitting (Transform)**: `_fit_transform` is called with `update_H=False` and `H=self.components_`.
    *   `W` is initialized (typically to zeros or using a small initialization, but in the Convex NNLS case with Coordinate Descent, it converges to the global optimum determined by the geometry).
    *   The solver is Coordinate Descent ('cd').
    *   The problem decomposes into finding optimal row vectors $w_i$ for each $x_i$ (row of $X$) such that $||x_i - w_i H||^2$ is minimized and $w_i \ge 0$.

**Calculated Results (Values for W):**
Based on the provided `X` and `components_` values, solving the NNLS system $w H \approx x$ for each row yields:

*   **Row 0**: Target $x_0 \approx [0.50, 0.14, 0.65, 1.52, 0.23]$. Solution weights $w_0 \approx [0.840, 0.028, 0.295]$.
*   **Row 1**: Target $x_1 \approx [0.23, 1.58, 0.77, 0.47, 0.54]$. Solution weights $w_1 \approx [0.162, 0.411, 1.679]$.
*   **Row 2**: Target $x_2 \approx [0.46, 0.47, 0.24, 1.91, 1.72]$. Solution weights $w_2 \approx [0.630, 1.502, 0.000]$.
*   **Row 3**: Target $x_3 \approx [0.56, 1.01, 0.31, 0.91, 1.41]$. Solution weights $w_3 \approx [0.289, 1.156, 0.704]$.
*   **Row 4**: Target $x_4 \approx [1.47, 0.23, 0.07, 1.42, 0.54]$. Solution weights $w_4 \approx [1.050, 0.098, 0.100]$.
*   **Row 5**: Target $x_5 \approx [0.11, 1.15, 0.38, 0.60, 0.29]$. Solution weights $w_5 \approx [0.201, 0.271, 1.145]$.

The method returns the computed matrix `W`.
