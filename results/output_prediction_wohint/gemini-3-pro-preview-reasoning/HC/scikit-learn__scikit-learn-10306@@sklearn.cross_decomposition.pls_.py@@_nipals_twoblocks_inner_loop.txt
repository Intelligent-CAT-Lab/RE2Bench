The function `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` implements the inner loop of the NIPALS (Non-linear Iterative Partial Least Squares) algorithm. It calculates the first pair of weight vectors (loadings), `x_weights` and `y_weights`, for the given data blocks `X` and `Y`.

**Trace of the Execution:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `X` is a $4 \times 3$ matrix.
    *   `Y` is a $4 \times 2$ matrix.
    *   `y_score` is initialized to the first column of `Y`.
    *   `mode` is 'A', so standard PLS regression formulas are used (covariance maximization).
    *   `ite` = 1.

2.  **Covariance Matrix Analysis (Mental Shortcut)**:
    *   NIPALS iteratively finds the vectors $w$ (`x_weights`) and $c$ (`y_weights`) such that they are the first left and right singular vectors of the covariance matrix $C = X^T Y$.
    *   Let's compute $C = X^T Y$:
        *   Row 0 of $X^T Y$: Dot products of $X_{col0}$ with $Y_{col0}$ and $Y_{col1}$.
            $(-1.16 \times -0.86) + \dots \approx 2.882$, $(-1.16 \times -0.88) + \dots \approx 2.893$.
        *   Row 1 of $X^T Y$: $X_{col1}$ with $Y$. $\approx 2.978$, $\approx 2.981$.
        *   Row 2 of $X^T Y$: $X_{col2}$ with $Y$. $\approx 2.857$, $\approx 2.831$.
    *   $C \approx \begin{pmatrix} 2.882 & 2.893 \\ 2.978 & 2.981 \\ 2.857 & 2.831 \end{pmatrix}$.
    *   Since the columns of $Y$ (and thus columns of $C$) are very similar positive vectors, the first singular vectors will correspond to the "average" direction.
    *   The algorithm should converge to the normalized singular vectors of $C$.

3.  **Iteration 1**:
    *   `x_weights` $\approx X^T y_{score} / (y^T y)$. This aligns with the first column of $C$ (scaled). Normalized, `x_weights` $\approx [0.5727, 0.5916, 0.5675]^T$.
    *   `x_score` = $X w$.
    *   `y_weights` $\approx Y^T x_{score} / (x^T x)$. This captures the correlation of individual $Y$ columns with the $X$-projection. Since $Y$ columns are highly correlated, `y_weights` will be close to equal weights.
    *   `norm_y_weights` is True, so `y_weights` is normalized. $\approx [0.707, 0.707]^T$.
    *   `y_score` updated.
    *   `x_weights` changed from 0, so diff is large. `ite` becomes 2.

4.  **Iteration 2**:
    *   `x_weights` is recalculated based on the new `y_score` (which is now effectively an average of $Y$ columns).
    *   The weights shift from aligning with $Y_0$ to aligning with $(Y_0 + Y_1)$.
    *   Calculated shift in `x_weights` is roughly $0.0025$ in norm.
    *   Check convergence: $0.0025 > 10^{-6}$. Continue. `ite` becomes 3.

5.  **Iteration 3**:
    *   Weights refine further. The convergence of NIPALS on this rank-1 dominant covariance structure is very fast (error reduces by factor of $\sim 10^{-5}$).
    *   Change in weights will be $\sim 10^{-8}$.
    *   Check convergence: $< 10^{-6}$. Break.

6.  **Final Values**:
    *   `ite` = 3.
    *   `x_weights`: First left singular vector of $C$. $\approx [0.5740, 0.5923, 0.5654]^T$.
    *   `y_weights`: First right singular vector of $C$. $\approx [0.7076, 0.7066]^T$.
