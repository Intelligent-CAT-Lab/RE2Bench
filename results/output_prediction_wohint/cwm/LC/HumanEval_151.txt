Step 1: We start by analyzing the input. The function `double_the_difference` is called with an empty list `lst = []`.

Step 2: The function's return statement uses a list comprehension to filter and process elements in the list `lst`. The conditions for each element are:
- It must be greater than 0 (`i > 0`)
- It must be odd (`i % 2 != 0`)
- It must not contain a decimal point (`'.' not in str(i)`)

Step 3: Since the list `lst` is empty, the list comprehension will generate an empty list.

Step 4: The `sum()` function is then called on this empty list. The sum of an empty list is 0.

Step 5: Therefore, the function returns 0.
