Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The input is `"14 15"`, so `vamshi` is set to 14 and `z` is set to 15.

2. The expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z` is evaluated:
   - `vamshi // z` is `14 // 15`, which equals 0 (integer division).
   - Adding 1 to the result gives `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Multiplying by `z` (15) gives `1 * 15 = 15`.

So the result of the print statement is 15.
