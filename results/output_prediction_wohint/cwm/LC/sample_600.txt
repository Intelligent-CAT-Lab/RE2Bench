Let's break down the code step by step.

The function `f` takes an input `array`. 

1. The line `just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array))` applies a lambda function to each element in the input `array`. The lambda function converts each number into a string of 'n's repeated that number of times. Since the input `array` is empty, `just_ns` will also be an empty list.

2. The line `final_output = []` initializes an empty list called `final_output`.

3. The loop `for wipe in just_ns:` will not execute because `just_ns` is empty. As a result, no elements are appended to `final_output`.

4. The function returns `final_output`, which remains an empty list since no elements were added during the loop.

Therefore, the output of the function `f` will be an empty list.
