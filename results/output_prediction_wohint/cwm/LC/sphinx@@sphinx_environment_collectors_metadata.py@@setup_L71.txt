I need to determine the output of the `setup` function given the input provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the function `setup` is defined to take an argument `app` of type `Sphinx`. Inside this function, the line `app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector)` is called. This method adds an environment collector to the Sphinx application. 

Looking at the implementation of `add_env_collector`, it logs a debug message and then enables the collector by calling `collector().enable(self)`. However, for the purpose of predicting the output, the exact implementation details of `MetadataCollector` and its `enable` method are not necessary because the `setup` function doesn't return any value based on these operations.

The `setup` function returns a dictionary with the keys `'version'`, `'parallel_read_safe'`, and `'parallel_write_safe'`. The values are `'builtin'`, `True`, and `True` respectively. These values are hardcoded in the function and do not depend on the input `app` or any other variables. 

Therefore, regardless of the input provided, the output of the `setup` function will always be the same dictionary.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
