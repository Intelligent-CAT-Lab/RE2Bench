The function `f` takes a single argument `title` and returns its lowercase version.

The input argument `title` is "   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ", which is passed to the function.

Inside the function, `title.lower()` is called, which converts all characters in the string to lowercase. This results in "   rock   paper   scissors  ".

Therefore, the function returns "   rock   paper   scissors  ".

[OUTPUT]

    "output": "   rock   paper   scissors  "
