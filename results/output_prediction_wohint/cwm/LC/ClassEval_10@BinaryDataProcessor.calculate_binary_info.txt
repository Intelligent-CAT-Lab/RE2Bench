Let's go through the execution step by step.

1. The method `calculate_binary_info` is called on an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` where `self.binary_string` is "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111".

2. `zeroes_count = self.binary_string.count('0')`:
   - This counts the number of '0' characters in the binary string.
   - Looking at the string: "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111", there are 19 '0's.
   - So, `zeroes_count` is 19.

3. `ones_count = self.binary_string.count('1')`:
   - This counts the number of '1' characters in the binary string.
   - Looking at the string, there are 17 '1's.
   - So, `ones_count` is 17.

4. `total_length = len(self.binary_string)`:
   - This gets the total length of the binary string.
   - The string has 36 characters.
   - So, `total_length` is 36.

5. `zeroes_percentage = zeroes_count / total_length`:
   - This calculates the percentage of '0's in the string.
   - 19 / 36 = 0.5277777777777778.

6. `ones_percentage = ones_count / total_length`:
   - This calculates the percentage of '1's in the string.
   - 17 / 36 = 0.4722222222222222.

7. The method returns a dictionary with these values:
   - {'Zeroes': 0.5277777777777778, 'Ones': 0.4722222222222222, 'Bit length': 36}.
