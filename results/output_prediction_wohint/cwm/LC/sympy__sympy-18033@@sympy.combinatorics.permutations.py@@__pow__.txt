1. `__pow__` function is called on a Permutation instance with `n=-2`.
2. `n` is checked to see if it's a Permutation, which it's not. So it proceeds.
3. `n` is converted to an integer: `n = int(n)`, resulting in `n = -2`.
4. The function then returns `self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`.
5. `self.array_form` is `None`, which implies that the actual array form of the permutation is not stored. However, since `_size` is 7, it's likely that the permutation operates on 7 elements.
6. `_af_pow` is a function that likely computes the power of a permutation's array form. Since the array form is not directly provided, we need to infer how `_af_pow` works.
7. Given that `n` is -2, it suggests that we need to compute the inverse of the permutation squared.
8. However, without the actual array form or more details on how `_af_pow` handles negative exponents, we can't compute the exact result. But we know that the result will be another Permutation instance created by `_af_new`.

Given the lack of specific details about the permutation's array form and the exact behavior of `_af_pow`, the most accurate prediction is that the function will return a new Permutation instance representing the result of raising the original permutation to the power of -2.
