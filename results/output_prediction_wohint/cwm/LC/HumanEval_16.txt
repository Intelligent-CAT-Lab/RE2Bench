Let's go through the function execution step by step.

The function is `count_distinct_characters` and it takes a string as input. The goal is to count the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case.

1. The input string is `"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY"`.
2. The function converts the string to lowercase using `.lower()`, resulting in `"jerry jerry jerry"`.
3. It then converts this string into a set, which removes any duplicate characters. The set will contain the characters `{'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', ' '}` (note the space is included).
4. The length of this set is calculated, which is `5`.

Therefore, the output of the function will be the integer `5`.
