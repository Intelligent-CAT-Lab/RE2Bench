I'll go through the code step by step to determine the output.

The function `convert_to_ascii` takes a binary string and converts it into ASCII characters. The input binary string is "01101000011001010110001001101111".

1. A bytearray is initialized to store the decimal values of each 8-bit binary segment.
2. The binary string is processed in chunks of 8 bits:
   - First 8 bits: "01101000" -> 104 in decimal, which corresponds to 'h' in ASCII.
   - Next 8 bits: "01100101" -> 101 in decimal, which corresponds to 'e' in ASCII.
   - Next 8 bits: "01100010" -> 98 in decimal, which corresponds to 'b' in ASCII.
   - Next 8 bits: "01101111" -> 111 in decimal, which corresponds to 'o' in ASCII.
3. The bytearray now contains the bytes for 'h', 'e', 'b', 'o'.
4. The bytearray is decoded using ASCII decoding, resulting in the string "hebo".

Therefore, the output of the function is "hebo".
