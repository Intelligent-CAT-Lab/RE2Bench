Let's walk through the code execution step by step with the given input:

1. The code reads the input string "3 4 7 8" and splits it into four integers: anti = 3, b = 4, c = 7, d = 8.

2. It calculates l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4.

3. It calculates m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4.

4. The code checks the conditions:
   - anti == c? 3 == 7? No.
   - b == d? 4 == 8? No.
   - l != m? 4 != 4? No.

5. Since none of the previous conditions are met, it executes the else clause.

6. The else clause prints the values: anti, d, c, b.
   So it will print: 3, 8, 7, 4.

Therefore, the output is:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "3 8 7 4"
}
```
