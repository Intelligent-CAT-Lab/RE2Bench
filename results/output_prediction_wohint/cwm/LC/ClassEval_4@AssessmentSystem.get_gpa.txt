Now, let's run through the step-by-step execution of the `get_gpa` function with the given input. 

We begin by initializing the `AssessmentSystem` object with the provided `students` dictionary. In this dictionary, there are entries for "Alice," "Bob," and "Charlie," each having a `name`, `grade`, `major`, and `courses`. For "Charlie," the `courses` dictionary contains two entries: "Chemistry" with a value of 70 and "Physics" with a value of 80.

Next, we call the `get_gpa` function with the argument `name="Charlie"`. The first step in the function is checking if "Charlie" exists in the `students` dictionary and if their `courses` dictionary is not empty. Since both conditions are true (Charlie is a student, and he has courses), we proceed to calculate the GPA.

The GPA is computed by summing the values of Charlie's courses (70 + 80) and then dividing by the number of courses (2). This calculation results in (70 + 80) / 2, which equals 75. Thus, the function returns 75 as Charlie's GPA.
