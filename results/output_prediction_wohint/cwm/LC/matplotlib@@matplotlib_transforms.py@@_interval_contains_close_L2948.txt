We are given the function `_interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10)`. Let's analyze its execution step by step with the given inputs.

1. The function starts by unpacking the `interval` into two variables, `a` and `b`. Given that `interval = "array([0.001, 1.   ])"`, we can assume `a = 0.001` and `b = 1.0`. However, note that arrays are not directly unpackable into individual variables in Python. Assuming a conversion or extraction of values from the array, we proceed with these numerical values.

2. The function checks if `a > b`. Since `0.001 < 1.0`, this condition is false, and the values remain `a = 0.001` and `b = 1.0`.

3. The function calculates `rtol` as `(b - a) * rtol`. Substituting the values:
   - `b - a = 1.0 - 0.001 = 0.999`
   - `rtol = 0.999 * 1e-10 = 9.99e-11`

4. The final step is to check if `val` lies within the interval `[a - rtol, b + rtol]`. Given `val = "array(0.2)"`, assuming the numerical value `0.2`, we calculate the bounds:
   - Lower bound: `a - rtol = 0.001 - 9.99e-11 ≈ 0.001` (since `9.99e-11` is negligible compared to `0.001`)
   - Upper bound: `b + rtol = 1.0 + 9.99e-11 ≈ 1.0`

   Since `0.001 ≤ 0.2 ≤ 1.0`, the condition is true.
