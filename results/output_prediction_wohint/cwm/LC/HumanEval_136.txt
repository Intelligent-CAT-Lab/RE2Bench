Okay, let's walk through the function step by step.

First, the function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list called `lst` as input. The input list here is `[-1, -3, -5, -6, 0]`.

Next, the code defines `smallest` by using a filter with a lambda function. The lambda checks if `x < 0`. This means it's looking for all negative numbers in the list. Looking at the input list, the negative numbers are `-1`, `-3`, `-5`, and `-6`. So `smallest` will be `[-1, -3, -5, -6]`.

Then, the code defines `largest` by using another filter with a lambda function that checks if `x > 0`. This is for finding all positive numbers. However, the input list only has negative numbers and `0`, and `0` is not greater than `0`, so `largest` will be an empty list.

Now, the return statement is `(max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None)`. 

For the first part, `max(smallest)`, since `smallest` is `[-1, -3, -5, -6]`, the maximum (closest to zero) is `-1`.

For the second part, `min(largest)` is evaluated. But `largest` is an empty list, so the condition `if largest else None` kicks in, resulting in `None`.

So the final return value should be `(-1, None)`.
