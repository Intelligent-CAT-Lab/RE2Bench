Let's walk through the execution of the function step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, `idx = 2`, and `added = 3`.
2. The line `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` is executed. 
   - `nums[idx:idx]` creates a slice from index 2 to index 2, which is an empty slice.
   - Inserting `(added,)` into this empty slice effectively inserts the value `3` at index 2 in the list.
   - After this operation, the list `nums` becomes `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.
3. The function returns the modified list `nums`.
