Let's go through the execution step by step.

1. The function `any_int` is called with the arguments `x = 2`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`.

2. The first condition checks if all three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are instances of `int`. Since `x = 2`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1` are all integers, this condition evaluates to `True`.

3. Now, the code enters the nested `if` statement. It checks whether any two of the numbers add up to the third. The condition is:
   `x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x`

   Let's evaluate each part:
   - `x + y == z`: 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
   - `x + z == y`: 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
   - `y + z == x`: 1 + 1 == 2 → 2 == 2 → True

   Since at least one of these conditions is `True`, the overall condition is `True`.

4. Because the condition is `True`, the function returns `True` immediately.

So, the function will return `True`.
