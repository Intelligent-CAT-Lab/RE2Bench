Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `dic` as an empty dictionary `{}`.
2. Inside the function, a new empty dictionary `d` is created.
3. The code enters the loop `for key in dic:`. Since `dic` is empty, the loop body is never executed.
4. The function returns `d`, which remains an empty dictionary.

Therefore, the output of the function will be an empty dictionary.
