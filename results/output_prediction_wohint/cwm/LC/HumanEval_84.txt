Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. The input value for N is 147.
2. The function converts N to a string, resulting in "147".
3. It then iterates over each character in the string, converting them back to integers. This gives us the integers 1, 4, and 7.
4. The sum of these integers is calculated: 1 + 4 + 7 = 12.
5. The binary representation of 12 is obtained using bin(12), which returns '0b1100'.
6. The [2:] slicing removes the '0b' prefix, leaving '1100' as the final result.
