Step 1: The function `TR111` is called with the argument `rv` set to "cos(phi)**2".
Step 2: Inside `TR111`, a nested function `f` is defined, which will be used in the `bottom_up` function.
Step 3: The `bottom_up` function is called with `rv` and the function `f` as arguments. This function applies `f` to all expressions in the expression tree of `rv` from the bottom up.
Step 4: The `f` function checks if the input `rv` is an instance of `Pow` and if its base is a trigonometric function with a positive or negative integer exponent. If not, it returns `rv` as is.
Step 5: In this case, `rv` is "cos(phi)**2", which is an instance of `Pow` with a base of `cos(phi)` and an exponent of 2. Since the base is a trigonometric function and the exponent is a positive integer, the function proceeds.
Step 6: The function checks the type of the base of the power expression. Since the base is `cos`, it returns `sec(phi) ** (-2)`.
Step 7: The `bottom_up` function applies `f` to the expression tree of `rv` and returns the result.
Step 8: The result of the `bottom_up` function is returned as the output of `TR111`.
