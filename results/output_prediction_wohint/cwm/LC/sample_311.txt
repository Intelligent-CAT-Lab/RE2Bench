Let's break down the execution of the function step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with the argument `text="A"`.
2. Inside the function, the line `text = text.replace('#', '1').replace('$', '5')` is executed. This replaces any occurrence of `#` with `1` and `$` with `5`. Since the input is `"A"`, there are no `#` or `$` characters, so this line has no effect and `text` remains `"A"`.
3. The next line checks if the modified `text` is numeric using the `isnumeric()` method. Since `"A"` is not a numeric character, `isnumeric()` returns `False`.
4. Therefore, the function returns `'no'`.
