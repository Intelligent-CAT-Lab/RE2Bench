I'll go step by step through the function f with the given input array [1, 2, 1].

1. First, the function receives the input array [1, 2, 1].
2. It creates a copy of this array into new_array, so new_array initially contains [1, 2, 1].
3. The new_array is then reversed, which doesn't actually create a new list but returns an iterator object that will traverse the elements in reverse order. So when we iterate over new_array now, it will give us 1, 2, 1 in that order (from last to first).
4. The function then creates a list comprehension where each element from new_array (now in reverse order) is squared.

Let me actually perform the calculations now:

The original array is [1, 2, 1]. When reversed, the elements we process are 1, 2, 1. Squaring these gives us 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, and 1^2 = 1. So the resulting list should be [1, 4, 1].
