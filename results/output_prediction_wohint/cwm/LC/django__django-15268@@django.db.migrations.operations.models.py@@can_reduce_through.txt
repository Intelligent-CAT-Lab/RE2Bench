The `can_reduce_through` method checks if an operation can be reduced through another operation, based on their types and app labels. Here, the method is called on an instance of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` with the `operation` parameter being another `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instance (but from a different class, "index_together" vs. "unique_together") and the `app_label` being "otherapp".

1. The method first calls `super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label)`. Since `operation` and `self` are instances of different classes (but both subclasses of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`), and assuming the superclass's `can_reduce_through` doesn't return True, this part likely returns False.

2. Then, it checks if `operation` is an instance of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` and if the type of `operation` is not the same as the type of `self`. In this case, since both are instances of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` but likely from different subclasses (e.g., `AlterUniqueTogetherOptionOperation` vs. `AlterIndexTogetherOptionOperation`), this condition evaluates to True.

Therefore, the method returns True.
