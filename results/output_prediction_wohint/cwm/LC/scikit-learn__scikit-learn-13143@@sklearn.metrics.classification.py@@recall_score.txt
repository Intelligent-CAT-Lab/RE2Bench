The function `recall_score` is called with `y_true` and `y_pred` both being `null`. In Python, when a function receives `null` as an argument, it is interpreted as `None`. Therefore, the function `precision_recall_fscore_support` is invoked with `y_true=None` and `y_pred=None`.

Inside `precision_recall_fscore_support`, the first step is to check the type of the targets using `_check_targets(y_true, y_pred)`. Since both `y_true` and `y_pred` are `None`, this function will raise a `ValueError` because it expects array-like inputs, not `None`. However, the error handling in `_check_targets` does not explicitly check for `None`, so it will proceed to call `type_of_target` on `None`, which will also raise a `ValueError` because `type_of_target` expects an array-like input.

Given the input provided, the execution of `recall_score` will result in an error due to the `None` values passed for `y_true` and `y_pred`. The exact error message would be something like "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None".
