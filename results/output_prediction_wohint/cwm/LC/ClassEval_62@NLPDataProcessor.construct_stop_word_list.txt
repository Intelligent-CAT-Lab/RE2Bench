The task is to determine the output of the `construct_stop_word_list` method given the inputs. Let's walk through the function step by step.

1. The function is called as `construct_stop_word_list`, and there are no arguments passed (since both `args` and `kwargs` are empty dictionaries).
2. Inside the method, a variable named `stop_word_list` is assigned a list of strings: `['a', 'an', 'the']`.
3. The function then returns the `stop_word_list`.

Since there are no loops, conditionals, or modifications to the list, the returned value is exactly the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`.
