Let's break down how the `match` function works with the given inputs.

The `match` function uses `re.match`, which attempts to match a pattern at the beginning of the string. The provided pattern is an email regex that looks for strings starting with word boundary (`\b`), followed by letters, numbers, or certain special characters, an `@` symbol, a domain name, and a valid top-level domain (2 or more letters).

Given:
- `pattern` = `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
- `text` = "iustd87t2euhifg.com"

The string "iustd87t2euhifg.com" does not have an `@` symbol, which is required by the regex for matching an email address. Since the entire string must match the pattern from the beginning, and it lacks the `@` symbol, the regex will not find a match.

Therefore, `re.match` will return `None`, and the function will return `False`.
