1. The function `getmodetype` is called with the argument `mode="RGB"`.
2. It calls `ImageMode.getmode("RGB")`, which retrieves the image mode corresponding to "RGB".
3. The `basetype` attribute of the retrieved image mode is then returned. For "RGB", this would be "RGB" itself, as it is already a base type.

```
{
    "return_value": "RGB"
}
