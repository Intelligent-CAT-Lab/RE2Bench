Now we must determine what the __invert__ function of the Permutation class returns. The __invert__ method returns an instance of the class Permutation with the array form set to the inversion of the current array form. 

Looking at the given input, the _array_form attribute of the permutation object is null. So, _af_invert is called with the _array_form, which is null. The _af_new function is then called with this inverted array form to create and return a new Permutation object. Therefore, the output will be a Permutation object where _array_form is the inversion of the _array_form of the input object.
