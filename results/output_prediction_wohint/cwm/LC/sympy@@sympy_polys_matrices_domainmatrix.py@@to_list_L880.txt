1. The `to_list` method is called on the provided `self` object, which is an instance of `DomainMatrix`. This method returns `self.rep.to_list()`.

2. The `rep` attribute of `self` is a dictionary representing a sparse matrix, where keys are row indices and values are dictionaries mapping column indices to matrix elements. The `to_list` method is called on this `rep` object.

3. Since `rep` is a sparse matrix (specifically, an `SDM` or Sparse Distributed Matrix), the `to_list` method for `SDM` is executed.

4. Inside `sdm.to_list`, the method initializes a dense matrix `ddm` filled with zeros, with the same shape as the sparse matrix.

5. It then iterates over the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix and places them into their corresponding positions in the dense matrix `ddm`.

6. For the given input, the sparse matrix has the following non-zero elements:
   - At position (0, 0): Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
   - At position (0, 1): Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])
   - At position (1, 0): Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])
   - At position (1, 1): Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])

7. These elements are placed into the dense matrix `ddm`, resulting in a 2x2 matrix where each element is a matrix itself.

8. The final `ddm` matrix is returned as the output of `to_list`.
