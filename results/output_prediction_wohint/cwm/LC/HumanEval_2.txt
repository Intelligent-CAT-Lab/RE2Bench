Okay, I need to figure out what the `truncate_number` function does and then apply it to the given input. Let's start by looking at the function definition. The function is called `truncate_number` and takes a single argument, `number`, which is a float. It returns the result of `number % 1.0`.

Hmm, what does the modulo operator (%) do with floats? I remember that for positive numbers, `x % 1.0` gives the fractional part of x. For example, if x is 1.33, then 1.33 % 1.0 would be 0.33. But wait, what if the number is negative? Let's not worry about that right now since the input is positive.

So, the input here is `number = 1.33`. Let's apply the function. The function returns `1.33 % 1.0`. Let me calculate that. The integer part of 1.33 is 1, and the fractional part is 0.33. So 1.33 minus 1 (which is 1.0 times 1) equals 0.33. Therefore, the result should be 0.33.

Wait, but let me double-check. The modulo operation with 1.0 effectively subtracts the largest multiple of 1.0 that is less than or equal to the number. Since 1.0 * 1 = 1.0, which is less than 1.33, subtracting that gives 0.33. Yes, that makes sense.

So, the output of the function should be 0.33. I should present this in the required JSON format inside [OUTPUT] tags.
