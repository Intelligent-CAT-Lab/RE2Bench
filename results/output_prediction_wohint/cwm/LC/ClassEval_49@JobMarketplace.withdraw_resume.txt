Let's break down the execution of the withdraw_resume method step by step.

First, the method is called with the argument resume, which is a dictionary representing a resume with name, skills, and experience. 

Looking at the code for withdraw_resume:
def withdraw_resume(self, resume):
    self.resumes.remove(resume)

This method attempts to remove the provided resume from the self.resumes list. 

Now, let's examine the state of self.resumes before the method is called. According to the input, self.resumes is an empty list. 

The method tries to remove the resume from self.resumes, but since the list is empty, the resume is not present in the list. 

In Python, if you try to remove an item from a list that doesn't contain the item, it raises a ValueError. 

Therefore, when this method is executed, it will raise a ValueError because it's trying to remove an item that doesn't exist in the list.
