<think>
We are going to execute the `update_product_quantity` method step by step. The object `self` has an inventory that includes a product with ID "1" (note: as a string), and the method is called with `product_id=1` (an integer) and `quantity=-3`.

1. The method starts by checking if `product_id` is in `self.inventory`. However, since `self.inventory` uses string keys ("1") and `product_id` is an integer (1), this condition evaluates to false.
2. Because the condition is false, the code inside the `if` block is not executed. The inventory remains unchanged.
3. The method does not return anything explicitly, so it implicitly returns `None`.
