Let's think step by step. The task is to convert the given octal number "51427" into a decimal number using the provided Python code.

1. The input octal number is "51427". In Python, the function `int()` can convert a string representation of a number in a given base to its decimal equivalent. The second argument to `int()` specifies the base of the number in the string. Since the number is octal (base 8), we use 8 as the second argument.

2. The code uses `int(octal_num, 8)`, where `octal_num` is "51427". This line will convert "51427" (base 8) to its decimal equivalent.

3. To verify the conversion, let's break down the octal number "51427":
   - The rightmost digit is 7 (8^0 * 7 = 7)
   - Next is 2 (8^1 * 2 = 16)
   - Then is 4 (8^2 * 4 = 256)
   - Next is 1 (8^3 * 1 = 512)
   - The leftmost digit is 5 (8^4 * 5 = 5120)

4. Adding all these values together: 5120 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7 = 5911.

So, the octal number "51427" converts to the decimal number 5911.
