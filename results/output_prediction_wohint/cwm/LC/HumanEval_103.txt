Okay, let's go step by step through the execution of the `rounded_avg` function with the given inputs.

The inputs are `n = 185` and `m = 546`. 

1. The function first checks if `m < n`. Here, `546` is not less than `185`, so this condition is false. The function skips returning `-1`.

2. A variable `summation` is initialized to `0`. This will hold the sum of all numbers from `n` to `m` (inclusive).

3. The function enters a loop using `range(n, m + 1)`. This means the loop runs for all integers starting from `185` up to and including `546`.

4. For each `i` in this range, the function adds `i` to `summation`. So after the loop completes, `summation` is the total sum of all integers from `185` to `546`.

5. After the loop, the function calculates the average by dividing `summation` by the number of elements, which is `(m - n + 1)`. Then it rounds this average and converts the result to a binary string using the `bin()` function.

Let's calculate the average step by step:

- The sum of integers from `185` to `546` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (number_of_terms) * (first_term + last_term) / 2`.
  
  Here, the first term is `185`, the last term is `546`, and the number of terms is `(546 - 185 + 1) = 362`.
  
  So, `sum = 362 * (185 + 546) / 2 = 362 * 731 / 2 = 362 * 365.5 = 132,103`.

- The average is `sum / number_of_terms = 132,103 / 362 ≈ 364.747`.

- Rounding this gives `365`.

- Converting `365` to binary using `bin(365)` results in `'0b101101101'`.

So the final output of the function should be the binary representation of the rounded average.
