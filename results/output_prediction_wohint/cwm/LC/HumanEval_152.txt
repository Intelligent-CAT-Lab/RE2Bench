To find the output of the `compare` function given the provided input, let's analyze the code step by step.

The `compare` function takes two arguments: `game` and `guess`. It uses a list comprehension to create a list of the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `game` and `guess`. The `zip` function is used to pair elements from `game` and `guess` based on their positions.

Given the input:
- `game = [1, 2, 3, 5]`
- `guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]`

Let's calculate the absolute differences for each pair:
1. First pair: `1` from `game` and `-1` from `guess` -> `abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(1 + 1) = abs(2) = 2`
2. Second pair: `2` from `game` and `2` from `guess` -> `abs(2 - 2) = abs(0) = 0`
3. Third pair: `3` from `game` and `3` from `guess` -> `abs(3 - 3) = abs(0) = 0`
4. Fourth pair: `5` from `game` and `4` from `guess` -> `abs(5 - 4) = abs(1) = 1`

Putting it all together, the list of absolute differences will be `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.
