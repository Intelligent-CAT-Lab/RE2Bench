1. The `check` function starts by checking if the given feature ("freetype2") is in the `modules` dictionary. Since this is not true, it continues to the next condition.
2. The next condition checks if the feature is in the `codecs` dictionary. Since this is also not true, it continues further.
3. The third condition checks if the feature is in the `features` dictionary. Assuming that the feature is present here, it proceeds to call the `check_feature` function with the feature name as the argument.
4. The `check_feature` function retrieves the corresponding module name, flag, and version from the `features` dictionary for the feature "freetype2".
5. The function attempts to import the module (PIL) and returns the value of the specified flag, which likely indicates whether the feature is available.
