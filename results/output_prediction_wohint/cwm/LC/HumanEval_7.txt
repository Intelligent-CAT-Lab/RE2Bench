The function `filter_by_substring` is being called with the following parameters:
- `strings`: a list of strings ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- `substring`: the string "run"

The function iterates over each string in the `strings` list and checks if the `substring` "run" is present in the string.

1. Checking "grunt": "run" is not in "grunt".
2. Checking "trumpet": "run" is in "trumpet".
3. Checking "prune": "run" is in "prune".
4. Checking "gruesome": "run" is not in "gruesome".

So, the filtered list will contain ["trumpet", "prune"].
