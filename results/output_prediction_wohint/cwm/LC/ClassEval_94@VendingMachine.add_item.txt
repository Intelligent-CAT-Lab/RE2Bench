Let's go through the function `add_item` step-by-step with the given input:

We are calling `add_item("Coke", 1.25, 10)` on a `VendingMachine` instance where the inventory already contains "Coke" with a price of $1.25 and a quantity of 20.

**Step 1:** The function starts by checking `if not self.restock_item(item_name, quantity):`.  
In this case, `item_name` is "Coke", and `quantity` is 10.

**Step 2:** Since "Coke" already exists in the inventory (as seen in the input), the `restock_item` function is called. It increments the quantity of "Coke" by 10, making the new quantity 30.  
The function `restock_item` then returns `True`, meaning that the item was successfully restocked.

**Step 3:** Since `restock_item` returned `True`, the condition `if not self.restock_item(...)` becomes `if not True`, which is `False`.  
This means that the code inside the `if` block is **not executed**, and the function ends without modifying the price of "Coke" or doing anything else.

**Conclusion:**  
The `add_item` function successfully restocks the "Coke" by adding 10 more units to its quantity. However, it does not attempt to add a new item (which it would only do if "Coke" wasn't already in the inventory). The price remains unchanged at $1.25, and the quantity is now 30.

Since the function does not return any value explicitly, it implicitly returns `None`.  
So the output is:

    "output": null
