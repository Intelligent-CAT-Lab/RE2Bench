Let's go through the execution of the `remove_vowels` function step by step with the given input.

The input to the function is the string "abcdef\nghijklm". The function's purpose is to remove all vowels from this string. Vowels are defined as the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in both lowercase and uppercase forms.

1. The function starts by iterating over each character `s` in the input string "abcdef\nghijklm".
2. For each character, it checks if the lowercase version of `s` is not in the list ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'].
3. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the resulting list.
4. Finally, the list of non-vowel characters is joined back into a string and returned.

Now, let's apply this to the input string:

- 'a' is a vowel, so it is removed.
- 'b' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'c' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'd' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'e' is a vowel, so it is removed.
- 'f' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- '\n' is a newline character, not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'g' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'h' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'i' is a vowel, so it is removed.
- 'j' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'k' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'l' is not a vowel, so it is kept.
- 'm' is not a vowel, so it is kept.

Putting it all together, the resulting string after removing vowels is "bcd\nfghjklm".
