I will go through the provided function `interval_contains` step by step with the given inputs to determine the output.

1. The function `interval_contains` is called with two arguments:
   - `interval` is given as "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])". It's assumed that this is a string representation of an array or a list containing two floating-point numbers.
   - `val` is given as -80.0, which is a float.

2. Inside the function, the first line is `a, b = interval`. This line attempts to unpack the `interval` into two variables `a` and `b`. However, since `interval` is a string, this will cause a `TypeError` because strings are not iterable in this context.

3. Even if the interval was properly formatted as a list or array (e.g., [-107.73502692, -7.73502692]), the rest of the function would proceed as follows:
   - The function checks if `a > b`. If true, it swaps `a` and `b` to ensure `a` is the smaller value.
   - Then, it checks if `val` is between `a` and `b` (inclusive) and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise.

Given the current inputs, the function will fail at the unpacking step due to the `interval` being a string instead of an iterable. However, assuming the input was intended to be a proper list or array (e.g., `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]`), let's continue with the logic:

- `a = -107.73502692`, `b = -7.73502692`
- Since `a < b`, no swap is needed.
- The function then checks if `-80.0` is between `-107.73502692` and `-7.73502692`.
- `-80.0` is indeed within this range, so the function would return `True`.

But again, the actual execution will fail because `interval` is a string. For the sake of providing an answer based on the intended input, let's assume the input was correctly formatted as a list.
