1. The function `read_manifest` is being called.
2. The method calls `self.open(self.manifest_name)` which is `self.open("staticfiles.json")`.
3. In `open`, `self._open(name, mode)` is called, which eventually returns `File(open(self.path(name), mode))`.
4. The `path` method is called to construct the full path to "staticfiles.json" by joining the `location` with "staticfiles.json".
5. If the file "staticfiles.json" exists at the location, its contents are read, decoded, and returned.
6. However, if the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is caught, and `None` is returned.
7. Since there's no indication that "staticfiles.json" exists at the specified location, it will likely return `None`.
