Step 1: The input to the function is a list [3, 2, 1, 0, 4].
Step 2: We start by creating a list using the list comprehension [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)].
Step 3: Enumerate(xs) will pair each element in xs with its index. So, it will produce (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 4).
Step 4: The list comprehension multiplies each element by its index: 0*3=0, 1*2=2, 2*1=2, 3*0=0, 4*4=16. So the list is [0, 2, 2, 0, 16].
Step 5: The function then returns this list but with the first element removed by using [1:]. So the returned list is [2, 2, 0, 16].
