Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output.

The code is as follows:
```python
import math
n = int(input())
x = 1
while math.log2(n) % 1:
    x += 1
    n -= 2 ** int(math.log2(n))
print(x)
```

Input:
```
{
    "input": "536870912"
}
```

Step-by-step execution:

1. `n = int(input())` sets `n` to `536870912`.

2. `x = 1` initializes `x` to 1.

3. The while loop condition is `math.log2(n) % 1`. This checks if the base-2 logarithm of `n` is an integer. If it is not (i.e., `math.log2(n) % 1` is not zero), the loop body executes.

Let's calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n` (536870912):
- `math.log2(536870912) = 29.0`, which is an integer.

Since the base-2 logarithm of `n` is an integer, the loop condition is false, and the loop body is never executed.

Therefore, `x` remains 1, and the code prints `x`, which is 1.
