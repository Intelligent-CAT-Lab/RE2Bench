1. The `__lt__` method is called with `self = 3` and `other = 1`.
2. Inside the `__lt__` method, `_sympify(other)` is called to convert `other` to a SymPy object. Here, `other = 1` is a Python integer, so `_sympify(1)` returns `Integer(1)`.
3. Since `other.is_Integer` is `True`, the method compares `self.p < other.p` using `_sympify(self.p < other.p)`.
4. `self.p` is 3 (as `self` is `Integer(3)`), and `other.p` is 1. The comparison `3 < 1` is `False`, so `_sympify(False)` returns `False`.
5. Therefore, the result of `__lt__` is `False`.
