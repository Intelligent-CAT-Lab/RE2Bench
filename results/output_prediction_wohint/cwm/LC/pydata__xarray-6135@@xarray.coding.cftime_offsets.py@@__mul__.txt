Step 1: The function QuarterOffset is a class that defines a time offset, specifically for quarters with a given month. 
Step 2: The `__mul__` method is called on an instance of QuarterOffset with `other=-1`. 
Step 3: Inside the `__mul__` method, `other` is checked if it is an instance of float. Since `-1` is not a float, it proceeds.
Step 4: The method returns a new instance of `QuarterOffset` with `n=-1 * 1` (since the original `n` is 1) and the same `month` value (2).
