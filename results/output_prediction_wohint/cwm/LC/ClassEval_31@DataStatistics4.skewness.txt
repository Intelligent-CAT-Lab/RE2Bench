We are given a static method `skewness(data)` and asked to compute its output for the input data [1, 1, 1]. Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `n = len(data)`: The length of the data array is 3.
   - `mean = sum(data) / n`: The sum of [1, 1, 1] is 3, so the mean is 3 / 3 = 1.0.

2. **Calculate Variance**:
   - The formula used is `sum(((x - mean)^2 for x in data)) / n`.
   - Since the mean is 1.0, each `(x - mean)` is 0 (1 - 1 = 0). Therefore, each squared term is 0.
   - The sum of squared terms is 0, so variance = 0 / 3 = 0.0.

3. **Calculate Standard Deviation**:
   - `std_deviation = sqrt(variance)` = sqrt(0.0) = 0.0.

4. **Calculate Skewness**:
   - The formula for skewness is `sum(((x - mean)^3 for x in data)) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation^3)` if `std_deviation != 0`, else 0.
   - Here, `std_deviation` is 0.0, so we use the else clause and set skewness = 0.

Therefore, the skewness of the dataset [1, 1, 1] is 0.
