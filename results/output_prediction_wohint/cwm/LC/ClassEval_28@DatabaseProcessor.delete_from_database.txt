Let's go through the execution of the `delete_from_database` method step by step.

1. The function is called with `table_name` as "test_table" and `name` as "Alice". The instance has `database_name` set to "test.db".
2. It connects to the SQLite database file "test.db" using `sqlite3.connect`.
3. A cursor object is created to interact with the database.
4. A SQL `DELETE` query is constructed with a placeholder (`?`) for safe substitution to prevent SQL injection. The query becomes "DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?".
5. The query is executed with the `name` parameter ("Alice") passed as a tuple, ensuring safe substitution.
6. The database changes are committed using `conn.commit()` to save the deletion.
7. The database connection is closed using `conn.close()`.

At this point, the function has completed the process of deleting the entry with name "Alice" from the "test_table" in the "test.db" database. Since the function does not return any value, the output is `None`.
