Let's break down the execution of the `same_chars` function with the given inputs.

1. The function takes two strings, `s0` and `s1`, as inputs. For this case, `s0` is "eabcdzzzz" and `s1` is "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc".

2. The function converts each string into a set of its characters. A set automatically removes duplicate characters, so each character in the string will only appear once in the resulting set.

3. For `s0 = "eabcdzzzz"`:
   - The characters are `e`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `z` (with multiple `z`s).
   - The set will be `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`.

4. For `s1 = "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc"`:
   - The characters are `d`, `z`, `e`, `a`, `b`, `c` (with multiple `d`s and `z`s).
   - The set will be `{'d', 'z', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

5. Now, the function compares the two sets. Since sets are unordered and only check for membership, the order and number of occurrences of characters in the original strings do not matter. As long as both sets contain exactly the same unique characters, they are considered equal.

6. Comparing `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}` and `{'d', 'z', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c'}`, we see they are identical. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
