We need to simulate the execution of the function `f` with the given input. Let's proceed step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `array` and `elem`. From the input, we know that `array` is [6, 2, 7, 1] and `elem` is 6.

2. The first line of the function checks if `elem` is present in `array`. Since 6 is indeed in the array, this condition evaluates to True.

3. When the condition is True, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in `array`. The index of 6 in the array [6, 2, 7, 1] is 0.

4. Therefore, the function will return 0.
