The code reads three integers from input: r, D, and x. It then enters a loop that runs 10 times. In each iteration, it updates x using the formula x = r * x - D, and prints the new value of x.

1. The input "2 100 105" is split into three integers: r = 2, D = 100, x = 105.
2. The loop runs 10 times. In each iteration, x is updated and printed.

Let's calculate the values of x in each iteration:

- Iteration 1: x = 2 * 105 - 100 = 210 - 100 = 110
- Iteration 2: x = 2 * 110 - 100 = 220 - 100 = 120
- Iteration 3: x = 2 * 120 - 100 = 240 - 100 = 140
- Iteration 4: x = 2 * 140 - 100 = 280 - 100 = 180
- Iteration 5: x = 2 * 180 - 100 = 360 - 100 = 260
- Iteration 6: x = 2 * 260 - 100 = 520 - 100 = 420
- Iteration 7: x = 2 * 420 - 100 = 840 - 100 = 740
- Iteration 8: x = 2 * 740 - 100 = 1480 - 100 = 1380
- Iteration 9: x = 2 * 1380 - 100 = 2760 - 100 = 2660
- Iteration 10: x = 2 * 2660 - 100 = 5320 - 100 = 5220

So, the output will be the values of x printed in each iteration, separated by newlines.
