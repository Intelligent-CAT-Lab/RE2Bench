The function `check_in` is called with the arguments `room_type="single"`, `room_number=2`, and `name="guest 1"`. The first step is to check if `room_type` exists in `self.booked_rooms`. The `booked_rooms` dictionary currently contains the key `"single"` with an empty dictionary as its value. Therefore, the condition `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():` evaluates to `False`, and the function does not return `False` at this point.

Next, the function checks if the `name` exists in the `booked_rooms[room_type]` dictionary. Since the `booked_rooms` for `"single"` is an empty dictionary, the name `"guest 1"` is not present. This causes the conditional block `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:` to be skipped, and the function does not execute any further code.

As a result, the function reaches its end without returning any value. In Python, when a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`.
