Let's step through the execution of the `create_order` function with the provided input.

1. The function `create_order` is called with arguments: `order_id=1`, `product_id=1`, `quantity=10`.

2. The function checks if the product quantity is sufficient by calling `get_product_quantity(product_id=1)`.

3. The `get_product_quantity` method checks if `product_id=1` exists in `self.inventory`. Since it does (from the input, `self.inventory` has key `"1"`), it returns the quantity `90`.

4. Since `90 >= 10`, the condition is true, and the function proceeds to update the product quantity and create the order.

5. `update_product_quantity(product_id=1, quantity=-10)` is called. This subtracts 10 from the quantity of product `1`, changing it from `90` to `80`.

6. The order is added to `self.orders` with `order_id=1`, `product_id=1`, `quantity=10`, and `status='Shipped'`.

7. Since the order was successfully created, the function does not return `False`. It implicitly returns `None` as there is no explicit return statement in the `create_order` method when the order is successfully created.

Therefore, the output of the `create_order` function is `None`.
