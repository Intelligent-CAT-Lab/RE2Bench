Let's walk through the execution of the function `f(string, encryption)` step by step with the given input.

The input to the function is:
- `string = "UppEr"`
- `encryption = 0`

Step 1: The function checks if `encryption` is equal to 0.
- `encryption` is indeed 0, so the condition `if encryption == 0` evaluates to `True`.

Step 2: Because the condition is true, the function returns the value of `string` directly.
- The `string` variable holds the value "UppEr".

Since the function returns the `string` without any modification, the output is simply "UppEr".

{
    "output": "UppEr"
