Let's walk through the execution of the `sum_squares` function step by step.

1. The function starts by initializing the variable `squared` to 0.

2. It then enters a loop where it processes each element in the input list `lst`. The list contains the numbers [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9].

3. For each element in the list, the function applies `math.ceil(i)`, which rounds the number up to the nearest integer:
   - `math.ceil(-1.4)` results in -1.
   - `math.ceil(17.9)` results in 18.
   - `math.ceil(18.9)` results in 19.
   - `math.ceil(19.9)` results in 20.

4. The function then squares the result of `math.ceil(i)` and adds it to `squared`:
   - For the first element, `(-1) ** 2 = 1`, so `squared` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
   - For the second element, `(18) ** 2 = 324`, so `squared` becomes 1 + 324 = 325.
   - For the third element, `(19) ** 2 = 361`, so `squared` becomes 325 + 361 = 686.
   - For the fourth element, `(20) ** 2 = 400`, so `squared` becomes 686 + 400 = 1086.

5. After all elements are processed, the function returns the final value of `squared`.
