Let's break down the execution of the function step by step.

1. The function `add` is called with `x=852` and `y=371`.
2. The function definition says it returns `x + y`.
3. Therefore, the result should be `852 + 371`, which equals `1223`.

So, the output of the function should be the sum of the two numbers provided as input.
