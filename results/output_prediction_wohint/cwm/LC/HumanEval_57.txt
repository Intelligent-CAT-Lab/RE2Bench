Let's go step by step through the execution of the `monotonic` function.

1. The function is called with the argument `l` which is a list containing four 9s: `[9, 9, 9, 9]`.
2. Inside the function, it first checks if `l == sorted(l)` or `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)`. 
   - Since `l` is already in non-decreasing order, `sorted(l)` will also be `[9, 9, 9, 9]`. So the condition `l == sorted(l)` evaluates to `True`.
   - Because the first part of the condition is `True`, the second condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` doesn't need to be checked due to short-circuiting in logical OR (`or`).
3. As a result, the function returns `True`.
