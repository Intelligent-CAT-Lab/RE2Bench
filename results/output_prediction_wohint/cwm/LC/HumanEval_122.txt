1. The function `add_elements` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of numbers) and `k` (an integer).
2. The function processes the first `k` elements of `arr`, which in this case is 4 elements.
3. It converts each element to a string and checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2. If so, it includes that element in the sum.
4. Let's break down the elements in `arr` up to the 4th index (0-based index):
   - `arr[0] = 111` --> string is "111" (length 3) --> not included.
   - `arr[1] = 21` --> string is "21" (length 2) --> included.
   - `arr[2] = 3` --> string is "3" (length 1) --> included.
   - `arr[3] = 4000` --> string is "4000" (length 4) --> not included.
5. The sum of the included elements is `21 + 3 = 24`.
