The `math_to_image` function is used to convert a mathematical expression into an image. The input is the mathematical expression "$x^2$" and the output is an image file named "example.png" saved in the "/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/" directory.

Step 1: The function starts by importing the `MathTextParser` from `matplotlib`. This parser is used to parse the mathematical expression.

Step 2: The parser is then used to parse the mathematical expression "$x^2$" with a DPI of 72. This gives the width, height, depth, and other properties of the parsed expression.

Step 3: A figure is created with the width and height of the parsed expression divided by 72. This is because the DPI is 72, so the figure size is in inches.

Step 4: The mathematical expression is then added to the figure as text at the position (0, depth/height). The font properties and color are set to the default values.

Step 5: The figure is then saved to the specified file path with the default DPI and format.

Step 6: Finally, the depth of the parsed expression is returned as the output of the function.
