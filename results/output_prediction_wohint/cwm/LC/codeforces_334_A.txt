The input is "8", so n = 8. Then, i is initialized to 1 and j is initialized to n * n, which is 64. 

The code enters a while loop that runs as long as i < j. Inside the loop, the code prints i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.

Let's track the values of i and j through each iteration:

Iteration 1: i = 1, j = 64. Print 1 64. i becomes 2, j becomes 63.
Iteration 2: i = 2, j = 63. Print 2 63. i becomes 3, j becomes 62.
Iteration 3: i = 3, j = 62. Print 3 62. i becomes 4, j becomes 61.
Iteration 4: i = 4, j = 61. Print 4 61. i becomes 5, j becomes 60.
Iteration 5: i = 5, j = 60. Print 5 60. i becomes 6, j becomes 59.
Iteration 6: i = 6, j = 59. Print 6 59. i becomes 7, j becomes 58.
Iteration 7: i = 7, j = 58. Print 7 58. i becomes 8, j becomes 57.
Iteration 8: i = 8, j = 57. Print 8 57. i becomes 9, j becomes 56.
Iteration 9: i = 9, j = 56. Print 9 56. i becomes 10, j becomes 55.
Iteration 10: i = 10, j = 55. Print 10 55. i becomes 11, j becomes 54.
Iteration 11: i = 11, j = 54. Print 11 54. i becomes 12, j becomes 53.
Iteration 12: i = 12, j = 53. Print 12 53. i becomes 13, j becomes 52.
Iteration 13: i = 13, j = 52. Print 13 52. i becomes 14, j becomes 51.
Iteration 14: i = 14, j = 51. Print 14 51. i becomes 15, j becomes 50.
Iteration 15: i = 15, j = 50. Print 15 50. i becomes 16, j becomes 49.
Iteration 16: i = 16, j = 49. Print 16 49. i becomes 17, j becomes 48.
Iteration 17: i = 17, j = 48. Print 17 48. i becomes 18, j becomes 47.
Iteration 18: i = 18, j = 47. Print 18 47. i becomes 19, j becomes 46.
Iteration 19: i = 19, j = 46. Print 19 46. i becomes 20, j becomes 45.
Iteration 20: i = 20, j = 45. Print 20 45. i becomes 21, j becomes 44.
Iteration 21: i = 21, j = 44. Print 21 44. i becomes 22, j becomes 43.
Iteration 22: i = 22, j = 43. Print 22 43. i becomes 23, j becomes 42.
Iteration 23: i = 23, j = 42. Print 23 42. i becomes 24, j becomes 41.
Iteration 24: i = 24, j = 41. Print 24 41. i becomes 25, j becomes 40.
Iteration 25: i = 25, j = 40. Print 25 40. i becomes 26, j becomes 39.
Iteration 26: i = 26, j = 39. Print 26 39. i becomes 27, j becomes 38.
Iteration 27: i = 27, j = 38. Print 27 38. i becomes 28, j becomes 37.
Iteration 28: i = 28, j = 37. Print 28 37. i becomes 29, j becomes 36.
Iteration 29: i = 29, j = 36. Print 29 36. i becomes 30, j becomes 35.
Iteration 30: i = 30, j = 35. Print 30 35. i becomes 31, j becomes 34.
Iteration 31: i = 31, j = 34. Print 31 34. i becomes 32, j becomes 33.
Iteration 32: i = 32, j = 33. Print 32 33. i becomes 33, j becomes 32.

At this point, i is no longer less than j, so the loop exits. The total number of iterations is 32, and each iteration printed a pair of numbers. The final output will be 32 lines of paired numbers, starting with 1 and 64, and ending with 32 and 33.
