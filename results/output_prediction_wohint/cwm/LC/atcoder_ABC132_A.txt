The code first takes the input string "FFEE" and sorts it character by character, which results in ["E", "E", "F", "F"]. The code checks if the first and second characters are equal ("E" == "E"), and if the third and fourth characters are equal ("F" == "F"). Additionally, it checks if the first and third characters are different ("E" != "F"). All conditions are met, so the output is "Yes".
