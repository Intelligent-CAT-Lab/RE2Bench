Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `extract_all` method is called on an instance of `ZipFileProcessor` where `file_name` is an empty string (`""`), and `output_path` is also an empty string (`""`).

2. The method enters a try block, attempting to create a `ZipFile` object by opening the file specified by `self.file_name`. Since `self.file_name` is an empty string, `zipfile.ZipFile` will raise a `FileNotFoundError` because it cannot find an empty file name.

3. When the `FileNotFoundError` occurs, the code jumps to the except block and returns `False`.

Therefore, the function will return `False` because the empty file name is invalid.
