Let's walk through the function call step by step with the given input:

1. The function `simplify` is called with `x = "7/2"` and `n = "4/2"`.
2. Inside the function, `a, b = x.split('/')` splits the string `"7/2"` into `a = "7"` and `b = "2"`.
3. Then, `c, d = n.split('/')` splits the string `"4/2"` into `c = "4"` and `d = "2"`.
4. The numerator is calculated as `int(a) * int(c)`, which is `7 * 4 = 28`.
5. The denominator is calculated as `int(b) * int(d)`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`.
6. The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` checks whether the result of dividing the numerator by the denominator is an integer. 
   - `numerator / denom` is `28 / 4 = 7.0`.
   - `int(numerator / denom)` is `int(7.0) = 7`.
   - Since `7.0 == 7` is `True`, the condition is satisfied.
7. The function returns `True` because the condition is met.
