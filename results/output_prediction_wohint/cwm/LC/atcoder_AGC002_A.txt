Let's break down the code step by step.

1. The input is "1 1000000000". The first line `a, b = map(int, input().split())` splits this string by whitespace into two parts and converts them to integers. So, `a` becomes 1 and `b` becomes 1000000000.

2. The next line `if a <= 0 and 0 <= b:` checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `a` is 1 (which is not <= 0), this condition is False.

3. The next line `elif a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0:` checks if `a` is less than 0 and if the minimum of `(b - a)` and `(-a)` is even. Since `a` is 1 (which is not < 0), this condition is also False.

4. Since the first two conditions are False, the code executes the else block and prints 'Positive'.
