In the given function `_eval_expand_trig`, the code calls `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)`. Since the `hints` parameter is an empty dictionary (`**kwargs` where `kwargs={}`), it simply passes `_eval_expand_trig` to `_calculate_reciprocal`. 

The function `_calculate_reciprocal` is not provided in the given code snippet, but based on the structure, it likely computes the reciprocal of a hyperbolic function's expansion using trigonometric identities. 

Assuming `_calculate_reciprocal` is implemented correctly, the output will be the reciprocal of the hyperbolic function's expansion. Since the exact implementation of `_calculate_reciprocal` is not given, the output would depend on how it processes the input.

However, based on the provided context, the `self` object has `nargs` with `_args_set` containing `'1'`, indicating a single argument is expected. Without additional details on how `_calculate_reciprocal` processes this, the output is likely a reciprocal hyperbolic expression.

Given the input parameters and the assumption that `_calculate_reciprocal` works as intended, the output should be the result of applying the reciprocal transformation to the hyperbolic function's expansion.
