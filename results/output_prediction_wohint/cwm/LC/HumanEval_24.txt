Let's go through the execution of the function step by step.

The function `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and aims to find its largest divisor. The function loops through the numbers from `n-1` down to 1 using `reversed(range(n))`. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If it finds such an `i`, it immediately returns that value as the largest divisor.

In this case, the input is `n = 3`.

1. The loop starts with `i = 2` (since `reversed(range(3))` produces the sequence 2, 1).
2. The condition `3 % 2 == 0` is evaluated. Since 3 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1, the condition is false.
3. The loop continues to the next value, `i = 1`.
4. The condition `3 % 1 == 0` is evaluated. Since 3 divided by 1 leaves no remainder, the condition is true.
5. The function returns `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the largest divisor of 3 (other than 3 itself) is 1.
