Let's go through the execution of the `heal` method step by step with the given input.

1. The `heal` method is called on an instance of the `RPGCharacter` class. The instance has the following attributes:
   - `name`: "John"
   - `hp`: 100
   - `attack_power`: 20
   - `defense`: 10
   - `level`: 1
   - `exp`: 0

2. The method starts by executing `self.hp += 10`. Since `self.hp` is 100, adding 10 makes it 110.

3. The next line checks if `self.hp` is greater than 100. Since 110 is greater than 100, the condition is true, and the code inside the if block is executed.

4. Inside the if block, `self.hp = 100` sets the `hp` back to 100 to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value of 100.

5. Finally, the method returns the value of `self.hp`, which is now 100.
