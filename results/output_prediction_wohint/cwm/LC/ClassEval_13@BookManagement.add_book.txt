Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `add_book` is called with the title "book2". 

1. The function checks if "book2" is already in the `inventory` dictionary.
2. Since "book2" is already present (with a quantity of 1), the function adds 1 to the existing quantity.
3. The quantity of "book2" in the inventory is now 2.

```
{
    "output": null
}
```
