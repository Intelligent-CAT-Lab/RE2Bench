Let's walk through the code step by step with the given input.

1. `N, A, B = map(int, input().split())`: The input string is `"1 0 1"`. Using `split()` divides it into `["1", "0", "1"]`. Converting each part to an integer results in `N = 1`, `A = 0`, and `B = 1`.

2. `ans = N // (A + B) * A`: First, calculate `A + B`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. Then compute `N // (A + B)` as `1 // 1 = 1`. Multiply this by `A` (which is `0`), so `ans` becomes `1 * 0 = 0`.

3. `rem = N % (A + B)`: Calculate the remainder of `N` divided by `A + B`. Since `N = 1` and `A + B = 1`, `rem` is `1 % 1 = 0`.

4. `ans += min(rem, A)`: Now, `rem` is `0` and `A` is `0`. The minimum of these two values is `0`. Adding this to `ans` (which is `0`) keeps `ans` as `0`.

5. `print(ans)`: The final value of `ans` is `0`, so this line outputs `0`.
