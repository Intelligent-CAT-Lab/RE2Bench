Let's go through the function execution step by step. 

The function `parse_music` is called with the input string ".| .| .| .|" (note the spaces between each part). 

1. First, the function defines a dictionary called `note_map` that maps music symbols to specific integer values. The mappings are:
   - 'o' maps to 4
   - 'o|' maps to 2
   - '.|' maps to 1

2. The next line uses a list comprehension to process the `music_string`. It splits the string by spaces using `split(' ')`, which gives a list of substrings: ['.|', '.|', '.|', '.|'].

3. The list comprehension then checks each element `x` in this list. Since all elements are non-empty (they are all '.|'), the condition `if x` is always true.

4. For each element `x`, it looks up the corresponding value in `note_map`. Since all elements are '.|', it retrieves the value 1 from the dictionary each time.

5. As a result, the list comprehension returns [1, 1, 1, 1], which is the final output of the function.
