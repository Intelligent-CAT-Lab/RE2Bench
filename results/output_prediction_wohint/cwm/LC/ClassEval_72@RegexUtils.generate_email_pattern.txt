The generate_email_pattern method in the RegexUtils class is responsible for creating a regular expression pattern to match email addresses. Let's break down what happens step-by-step when this method is called.

1. Inside the generate_email_pattern method, a string variable named pattern is assigned a value. This value is a raw string that represents the regular expression pattern for matching email addresses.
   
   The pattern consists of several parts:
   - \b: Word boundary, ensuring the pattern matches the entire email and not part of another word.
   - [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+: Matches one or more characters that are letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, or special characters like dot (.), underscore (_), percent (%), plus (+), or hyphen (-).
   - @: Matches the @ symbol which separates the local part from the domain of the email.
   - [A-Za-z0-9.-]+: Matches one or more characters for the domain name part, including letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.
   - \.: Matches a literal dot before the top-level domain.
   - [A-Z|a-z]{2,}: Matches the top-level domain, which must be at least two characters long and can be any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters. Note that the | character inside the character class is treated as a literal and not as an OR operator, which might be a mistake in the pattern.
   - \b: Another word boundary to ensure the entire email is matched.

2. The pattern string is then returned by the method.

Given this explanation, the output of the generate_email_pattern method would be the regular expression pattern string as defined.
