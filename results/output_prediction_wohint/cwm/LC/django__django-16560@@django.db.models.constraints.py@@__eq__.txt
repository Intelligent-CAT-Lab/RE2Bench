The `__eq__` method is being called on an instance of `CheckConstraint`. The method checks if the `other` object is also an instance of `CheckConstraint`. If it is, then it compares the `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message` attributes of both instances. 

In this case, the `other` object is an instance of `CheckConstraint` and all the attributes match exactly with the current instance. Therefore, the method should return `True`.
