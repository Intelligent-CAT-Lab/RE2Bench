<think>
I am given an AST node representing a BinOp, specifically a union type `int | None` in a type annotation. The visit_BinOp function is designed to unparse the BinOp node into a string. Since the operator is not a power operator, it joins the left operand, operator, and right operand with spaces. The left operand is the name 'int', the operator is the union symbol '|', and the right operand is 'None'. Therefore, the output should be the string 'int | None'.

[OUTPUT]
```
"int | None"
```
