Let's walk through the execution of the function step by step:

1. The function `next_smallest` is called with the list `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.
2. The first line inside the function assigns `lst` to the sorted version of the set created from the input list. 
   - The `set(lst)` call removes duplicates, but since all elements in the list are unique, this gives `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
   - The `sorted()` function then sorts this set in ascending order, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. The next line checks if the length of `lst` is less than 2. Since the length is 5, this condition is false.
4. Therefore, the function returns the element at index 1 of the sorted list, which is `2`.
