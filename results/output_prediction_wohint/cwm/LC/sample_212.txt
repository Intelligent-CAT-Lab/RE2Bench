Let's step through the function execution.

The function `f` takes a list `nums` and reverses it `len(nums) - 1` times. 

The input list is: [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]

The length of the list is 7. So, the loop will run 6 times.

1. First iteration: Reverse the list → [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]
2. Second iteration: Reverse again → [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]
3. Third iteration: Reverse → [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]
4. Fourth iteration: Reverse → [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]
5. Fifth iteration: Reverse → [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]
6. Sixth iteration: Reverse → [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]

After 6 reversals, the final list is [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3].
