The function `_convert_type_spec` is called with the arguments `_type="str"` and `translations={}`.

1. The function first checks if `_type` is in the `translations` dictionary. Since `translations` is empty, this condition is false.
2. Next, it checks if `_type` is equal to `'None'`. Since `_type` is `"str"`, this condition is also false.
3. The function then returns `:class:`%s`` % _type, where `%s` is replaced with the value of `_type`, which is `"str"`. Therefore, the returned value is `:class:`str``.
