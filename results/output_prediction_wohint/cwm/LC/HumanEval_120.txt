Let's walk through the code execution step by step.

1. The function `maximum` is called with arguments `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.
2. The first condition checks if `k == 0`. Since `k` is 2, this condition is false, so the code skips the `return []` statement.
3. The next line sorts the array `arr` in ascending order. The original array is `[-4, 4]`, which is already sorted, so it remains `[-4, 4]`.
4. The variable `ans` is assigned the slice of the array starting from the index `-k` to the end. Since `k` is 2, `-k` is `-2`, so `arr[-2:]` gives the entire array `[-4, 4]`.
5. The function returns the value of `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.
