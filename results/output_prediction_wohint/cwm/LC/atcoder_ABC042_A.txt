The code starts by reading the input, which is "7 5 5". This input is split into individual numbers and then converted into integers. The resulting tuple `ABC` is (7, 5, 5). The code then checks how many times 5 appears in `ABC`. Since 5 appears twice, the condition `ABC.count(5) == 2` is true. Next, the code checks if the sum of the elements in `ABC` equals 17. The sum of 7, 5, and 5 is 17, so the condition `sum(ABC) == 17` is also true. Since both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES'.
