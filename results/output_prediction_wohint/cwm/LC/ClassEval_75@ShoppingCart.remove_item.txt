The code to be executed is the `remove_item` method of the `ShoppingCart` class. Let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The `remove_item` method is called with `self` having an `items` dictionary where the key "apple" has a value of `{"price": 1, "quantity": 4}`, and the argument `item` is "apple" with the default `quantity` of 1.

2. The method checks if `item` is in `self.items`. Since "apple" exists in the `items` dictionary, it enters the `if` block.

3. Inside the `if` block, it subtracts the given `quantity` (which is 1) from `self.items[item]['quantity']`. This changes the quantity of "apple" from 4 to 3.

4. The method does not return anything, so it implicitly returns `None`.

After the execution of the `remove_item` method, the `items` dictionary will have the quantity of "apple" changed to 3.
