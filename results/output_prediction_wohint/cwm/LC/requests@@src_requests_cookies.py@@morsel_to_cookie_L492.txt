<think>
Since the `max-age` field in the morsel is an empty string, which is falsy, the `if morsel['max-age']:` condition evaluates to False. The code then proceeds to check the `elif morsel['expires']:` condition. The `expires` field in the morsel is "woops", which is truthy, so this condition evaluates to True.

The code then attempts to parse the `expires` value using `calendar.timegm(time.strptime(morsel['expires'], time_template))`. However, "woops" is not a valid date string in the specified format, so `time.strptime` raises a `ValueError`. This exception is not caught in the current function, so it propagates up and causes the function to fail.

Therefore, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception and not return a valid cookie.

The function raises a ValueError exception.
