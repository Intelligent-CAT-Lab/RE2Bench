Let's go through the function step by step with the given input.

1. The function `get_display_profile` is called with `handle=None`.
2. The first line checks if the platform is not 'win32'. Since the input doesn't specify the platform, we assume it's not 'win32' (as per the function's logic, it returns None for non-Windows platforms).
3. Because `sys.platform != 'win32'` evaluates to True, the function immediately returns `None` without executing any further lines.

Therefore, the output of the function is None.
