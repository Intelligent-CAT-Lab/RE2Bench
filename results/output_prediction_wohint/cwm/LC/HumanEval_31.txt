Let's execute the `is_prime` function step by step for the input `n = 13441`.

1. The function is called with `n = 13441`.
2. The first line checks if `n < 2`. Since `13441` is much larger than 2, this condition is False, so the function skips this branch and proceeds.
3. The next line starts a loop: `for k in range(2, n - 1)`. Here, `n - 1` is `13440`, so this loop will iterate over `k` from 2 up to `13439`.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n % k == 0` (i.e., if `k` is a divisor of `n`). If it finds such a `k`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
5. For `n = 13441`, the function will check all possible divisors starting from `k = 2` upwards. If none of these values divide `13441` evenly, the loop completes without returning `False`.
6. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function proceeds to the next line and returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, we need to determine whether `13441` is actually a prime number.

To check this, we can verify if there are any integers between 2 and `13440` that divide `13441` without leaving a remainder. However, doing this manually would be time-consuming. Instead, we can note that a number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Given the nature of the function, it will return `True` only if `13441` is prime.

After checking possible divisors, we find that `13441` is indeed a prime number. Therefore, the function will return `True`.
