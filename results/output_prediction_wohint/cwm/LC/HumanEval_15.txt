I need to determine the output of the function `string_sequence` when given an input of `n = 10`.

First, I should look at how the function is defined. It's a function named `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` and returns a string. The function's body creates a list of strings by converting each number in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to a string. Then, it joins these strings together with spaces in between.

Let me break down the key steps:

1. `range(n + 1)`: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to and including `n`. Since `n` is 10, this range will be 0 through 10.
2. `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]`: This list comprehension converts each number in the range to a string. So, the list will be `['0', '1', '2', ..., '10']`.
3. `' '.join(...)`: This joins all the string elements in the list with a single space character between each pair of elements. The result will be a single string where each number from 0 to 10 is separated by a space.

Putting this together, when `n = 10`, the function should return the string "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".

{
    "output": "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
