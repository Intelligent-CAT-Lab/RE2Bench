Step 1: The function `_cmp_name` is called with two class types, `ImaginaryUnit` and `Pi`, both from the `sympy.core.numbers` module.
Step 2: The first step is to get the names of these two classes using `__name__`.
Step 3: We compare the class names. Here, the class names are "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi", which are not equal.
Step 4: We check if either of these classes is a subclass of `Basic`. Since both `ImaginaryUnit` and `Pi` are subclasses of `Basic`, we proceed.
Step 5: The `ordering_of_classes` list is used to determine the order of the classes. We need to check the positions of "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" in this list.
Step 6: Assuming that "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" are not explicitly listed in `ordering_of_classes`, their indices would be assigned the value of `UNKNOWN` (which is the length of `ordering_of_classes` plus 1).
Step 7: Since both `i1` and `i2` (the indices) are equal to `UNKNOWN`, the final comparison is done lexicographically based on the class names "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi".
Step 8: Comparing "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" lexicographically, "ImaginaryUnit" is greater than "Pi" (since 'I' comes after 'P' in alphabetical order), so the result is 1.
