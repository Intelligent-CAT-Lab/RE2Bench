I need to figure out what the output of the `_is_decade` function will be given the input `x=1e-07`, `base=10`, and `rtol=1e-07`.

First, let's go through the function step by step. 

The function checks if `x` is finite using `np.isfinite(x)`. Since `1e-07` is a finite number, this check will pass and the function will proceed.

Next, it checks if `x` is exactly zero. Since `x` is `1e-07` (not zero), this check will also pass.

Then, the function calculates `lx` as the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of `x`. The absolute value of `1e-07` is `1e-07`, and the base-10 logarithm of `1e-07` is `-7.0`. So, `lx` will be `-7.0`.

Now, the function checks if `rtol` is `None`. In this case, `rtol` is provided as `1e-07`, so it proceeds to the `else` clause. Here, it checks if `lx` is close to its rounded value within the relative tolerance `rtol`.

The rounded value of `lx` (`-7.0`) is `-7.0` itself. Since `lx` is exactly `-7.0`, the difference between `lx` and its rounded value is zero. 

The function `np.isclose` checks if two numbers are element-wise within a tolerance of each other. The relative tolerance `rtol=1e-07` means that the numbers are considered close if their relative difference is less than or equal to `1e-07`. 

In this case, since the absolute difference is zero, the relative difference is also zero, which is less than `1e-07`. Therefore, `np.isclose(lx, np.round(lx), rtol=rtol)` will return `True`.

So, the final output of the function will be `True`.
