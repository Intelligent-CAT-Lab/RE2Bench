The `dup_abs` function takes a list `f` representing a polynomial and a domain `K`, and returns a new list where each coefficient's absolute value is computed using `K.abs`. 

Given the input `f = [2]` and `K = "ZZ"`, we need to understand what `K.abs` does. Since `K` is "ZZ", which likely represents the ring of integers, the `abs` function should return the absolute value of the coefficient.

Step-by-step:
1. Iterate over each coefficient in `f`, which is just `[2]`.
2. Apply `K.abs` to each coefficient. Since `K` is "ZZ", `K.abs(2)` should return `2` because 2 is already positive.
3. The resulting list is `[2]`.
