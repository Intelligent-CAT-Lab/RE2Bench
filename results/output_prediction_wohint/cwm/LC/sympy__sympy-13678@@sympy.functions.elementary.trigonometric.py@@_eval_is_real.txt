<think>
The function `_eval_is_real` is a method that checks if the given input is real. Since the input to the function is an empty dictionary and the function does not have any arguments or keyword arguments, it seems like the function is being called without any input. 

Therefore, the function will return None as the output because it does not have any input to process.
