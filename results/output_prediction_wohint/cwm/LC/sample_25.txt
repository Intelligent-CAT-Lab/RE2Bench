Let's break down the function `f` step by step with the given input dictionary `d`.

1. The function starts by creating a copy of the input dictionary `d` using `d = d.copy()`. This ensures that the original dictionary is not modified. The copied dictionary initially looks like `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.

2. Next, the function calls `d.popitem()`. The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last key-value pair inserted into the dictionary. Since dictionaries in Python (versions before 3.7) do not maintain insertion order, but for the sake of this analysis, let's assume that the last inserted item is "x:: 3" (note: the key is "x:" with a colon). This item is removed, leaving the dictionary as `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.

3. Finally, the function returns the modified dictionary `d`.

So, the output of the function `f` given the input dictionary is the dictionary `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
