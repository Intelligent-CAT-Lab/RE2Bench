Let's walk through the code step by step.

The input is `"20 30"`, which means the variables A and B will be assigned 20 and 30, respectively.

1. `A, B = map(int, input().split())` will parse the input into integers A = 20 and B = 30.
2. `ans = A - 2 * B` computes the value 20 - (2 * 30) = 20 - 60 = -40.
3. `if ans < 0:` checks if the result is less than zero, which is true here.
4. `ans = 0` sets ans to 0 since the previous value was negative.
5. `print(ans)` outputs the value of ans, which is 0.

So, the output will be 0.
