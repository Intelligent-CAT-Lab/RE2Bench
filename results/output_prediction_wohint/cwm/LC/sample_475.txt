Let's walk through the function `f(array, index)` step by step based on the given input:

1. The function is called with `array = [1]` and `index = 0`.
2. The first line checks if `index < 0`. Since `index` is `0`, this condition is false and we skip the body of the if statement.
3. The function then returns `array[index]`, which is `array[0]`.
4. Since `array[0]` is `1`, the function returns `1`.
