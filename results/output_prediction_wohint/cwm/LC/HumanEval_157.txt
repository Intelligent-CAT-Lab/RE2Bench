Let's break down the execution step by step.

The function `right_angle_triangle` checks if any of the three sides of a triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, which determines if the triangle is right-angled.

Given the inputs:
a = 10, b = 6, c = 8.

We will evaluate each condition in the return statement:

1. `a * a == b * b + c * c`: This checks if a² = b² + c².
   - a² = 10 * 10 = 100
   - b² = 6 * 6 = 36
   - c² = 8 * 8 = 64
   - b² + c² = 36 + 64 = 100
   - Since 100 = 100, this condition is true.

Because one of the conditions is true, the function will immediately return `True` without evaluating the other conditions.
