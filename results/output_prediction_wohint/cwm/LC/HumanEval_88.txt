Let's go step by step.

1. We are given the function `sort_array(array)` and the input `[5]`.
2. The function checks if the array is empty. Since the array has one element, it proceeds.
3. The sorting direction is determined by the expression `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0`. Here, `array[0]` is 5 and `array[-1]` is also 5 (since it's the only element).
4. Adding them gives `5 + 5 = 10`. Taking modulo 2 of 10 gives `10 % 2 = 0`, so the condition is `True`.
5. The `reverse` parameter in the `sorted()` function is set to `True` because the condition evaluates to `True`.
6. The array `[5]` is sorted in reverse order. However, since there's only one element, the sorted array remains `[5]`.
