Let's analyze the step-by-step execution of `restock_item` with the given input.

1. The method `restock_item(item_name, quantity)` is called with `item_name = "Pizza"` and `quantity = 10`.
2. The method checks if `item_name` (i.e., "Pizza") exists in `self.inventory`. 
   - The `self.inventory` currently contains only the key "Coke". 
   - Therefore, "Pizza" is not in `self.inventory`.
3. Since "Pizza" is not present in the inventory, the code proceeds to the `else` clause and returns `False`.

The function will return `False` because the item "Pizza" does not exist in the inventory.
