Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. The code starts by reading input using `input()`, splitting the result by '.' into a list called `num`. For the input "2.4", this gives `num = ['2', '4']`.

2. The next part checks if the last character of the first element of `num` (which is '2') converted to an integer is equal to 9. Since 2 is not 9, this condition is false.

3. The code then moves to the elif statement, checking if the first character of the second element of `num` (which is '4') converted to an integer is greater than or equal to 5. Since 4 is less than 5, this condition is also false.

4. Since both the if and elif conditions are false, the code proceeds to the else clause.

5. In the else clause, the code prints the first element of `num`, which is '2'.

Therefore, the final output will be '2'.
