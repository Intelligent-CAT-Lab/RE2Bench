Let's break down the function execution step by step.

1. The function `compare_one` is called with `a=1` and `b="2,3"`.
2. The variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are assigned the values of `a` and `b` respectively. So, `temp_a=1` and `temp_b="2,3"`.
3. Since `temp_a` is an integer (not a string), the first `if` block is skipped.
4. `temp_b` is a string, so the second `if` block is executed. The string "2,3" has its comma replaced with a dot, resulting in `temp_b="2.3"`.
5. The code then compares `float(temp_a)` and `float(temp_b)`. Here, `float(temp_a)` is `1.0` and `float(temp_b)` is `2.3`.
6. Since `1.0` is not equal to `2.3`, the function returns the value corresponding to the greater float. Since `1.0` is less than `2.3`, the function returns `b`, which is the string "2,3".
