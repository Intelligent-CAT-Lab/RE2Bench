Let's walk through the execution of the program step by step.

1. The program starts by importing the `sys` module, but this isn't directly relevant for the execution flow.
2. The `main` function is defined, which does the core work.
3. Inside the `main` function:
   - The first line reads the input `"74 74"` and uses `map(int, input().split())` to split the input into two integers, 74 and 74, assigning them to `S` and `W`, respectively.
   - The next line uses a conditional expression. Since `S` is equal to `W` (both are 74), the condition `S <= W` evaluates to `True`.
   - As a result, the program prints 'unsafe'.

Thus, the output of the program will be:

[OUTPUT]
unsafe
[/OUTPUT]
