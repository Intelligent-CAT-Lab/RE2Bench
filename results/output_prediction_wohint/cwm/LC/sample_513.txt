The function starts with an empty list as the input array. Let's walk through each loop step by step.

1. The first while loop checks if -1 is in the array. Since the array is empty, the condition is false, so this loop does not execute.

2. The second while loop checks if 0 is in the array. Again, since the array is empty, the condition is false, so this loop does not execute.

3. The third while loop checks if 1 is in the array. The array is still empty, so this condition is also false, and the loop does not execute.

Since none of the loops modified the array, it remains empty. The function then returns the array.
