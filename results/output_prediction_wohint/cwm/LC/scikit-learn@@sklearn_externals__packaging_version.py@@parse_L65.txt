1. `parse` function is called with version "1.11.3". 
2. Inside `parse`, `Version(version)` is called with "1.11.3".
3. In `Version.__init__`, the regex pattern is applied to the version string "1.11.3". The match groups are:
   - epoch: None (so default to 0)
   - release: "1.11.3"
   - pre_l, pre_n: None (no pre-release)
   - post_l, post_n1, post_n2: None (no post-release)
   - dev_l, dev_n: None (no dev)
   - local: None
4. The version is parsed into:
   - epoch: 0
   - release: (1, 11, 3)
   - pre, post, dev, local: None (since no corresponding groups were found)
5. A key for sorting is generated using these parsed values.
6. The `Version` object is successfully created and returned.
7. Since no exception is raised, `parse` returns the `Version` object.
