Let's walk through the step-by-step execution of the `add_event` function with the provided input.

1. **Initialization**: The `CalendarUtil` instance `self` is initialized with a list of events. The list already contains one event with the date "2023-01-01T00:00:00", start time "2023-01-01T00:00:00", end time "2023-01-01T01:00:00", and description "New Year".

2. **Function Call**: The `add_event` function is called with an `event` argument. This argument is another event dictionary with the same details: date, start time, end time, and description as the existing event in `self.events`.

3. **Appending the Event**: Inside the `add_event` method, the line `self.events.append(event)` adds the provided event to the `self.events` list. This means the existing event in the list will now be followed by another identical event.

4. **Resulting State**: After the `add_event` function completes, the `self.events` list will contain two identical events. Each event has the same date, start time, end time, and description.

Therefore, the output of the `add_event` function in terms of the resulting `self.events` is a list with two identical event dictionaries.
