Let's execute the code step by step to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15.

1. The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with `a = 10` and `b = 15`.
2. We enter the `while b:` loop because `b` (15) is not zero.
3. Inside the loop, we perform the Euclidean algorithm:
   - `a, b = (b, a % b)` updates `a` to 15 (previous `b`) and `b` to 10 % 15 = 10.
4. We check the loop condition again: `b` is now 10 (non-zero), so we loop again.
5. Perform another iteration:
   - `a, b = (b, a % b)` updates `a` to 10 (previous `b`) and `b` to 15 % 10 = 5.
6. Check the loop condition: `b` is 5 (non-zero), so we loop again.
7. Perform another iteration:
   - `a, b = (b, a % b)` updates `a` to 5 (previous `b`) and `b` to 10 % 5 = 0.
8. Check the loop condition: `b` is now 0, so we exit the loop.
9. The function returns `a`, which is 5.

The GCD of 10 and 15 is 5.
