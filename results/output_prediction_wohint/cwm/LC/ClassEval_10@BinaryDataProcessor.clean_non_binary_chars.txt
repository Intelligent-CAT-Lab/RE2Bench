The function `clean_non_binary_chars` is called on an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` where `self.binary_string` is initialized to "01101000011011010110001001101111". The purpose of this function is to filter out any characters that are not '0' or '1'.

1. The original string is "01101000011011010110001001101111".
2. The function uses `filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string)` to keep only the characters '0' and '1'.
3. Since the input string only contains '0's and '1's, no characters are filtered out.
4. The filtered string is then joined back into a single string using `''.join(...)`.

Therefore, the final value of `self.binary_string` remains unchanged as "01101000011011010110001001101111".
