Let's break down the execution of the `due` method step by step.

1. The `due` method starts by checking if `self.promotion` is `None`. In this case, it's not `None` because `promotion` is provided as an input.

2. Since `self.promotion` is not `None`, the code calls `self.promotion(self)`. This function will apply a discount based on the promotion strategy.

3. The `__total` attribute of the instance is initialized to 150.0, which represents the total cost of the items in the cart.

4. The `due` method subtracts the discount (calculated by the promotion function) from the total to return the final amount due.

The cart contains 15 items, each costing 10.0, making a total of 15 * 10.0 = 150.0. Assuming the promotion function applies a specific discount, but without the exact implementation details of the promotion function, we can't calculate the exact discount. However, based on the input data provided, let's assume the promotion function calculates the discount correctly.

Given the structure of the data, if the promotion function is designed to apply a certain rule (like a bulk discount), it will return a specific discount amount. Let's suppose the promotion function returns a discount of 15.0 (though this is just an assumption based on the context).

Therefore, the final amount due would be `150.0 - 15.0 = 135.0`.
