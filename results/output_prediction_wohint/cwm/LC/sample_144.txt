Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

The function `f` takes an argument `vectors`, which is a list of lists (since it's supposed to contain vectors). The function initializes an empty list `sorted_vecs`. Then, it loops through each `vec` in `vectors`, sorts it in-place using `vec.sort()`, and appends it to `sorted_vecs`. Finally, it returns `sorted_vecs`.

Now, let's look at the input:
The `vectors` argument is an empty list `[]`. This means the for loop will not execute at all because there are no elements to iterate over. As a result, `sorted_vecs` remains an empty list, and the function returns it.

So, the output of the function will be an empty list.
