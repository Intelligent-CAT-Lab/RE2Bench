Let's break down the code and input step by step.

1. The code reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is "1 1 1", so the values of A, B, and T will be 1, 1, and 1 respectively.

2. The code calculates `ans` as `T // A * B`. Since T and A are both 1, `T // A` is 1. Multiplying that by B (which is 1) gives `ans = 1`.

3. Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is 1.
