<think>
The function f() starts by defining a dictionary d with two keys: 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'. Each key maps to a list of tuples representing cities and their countries. 

On the next line, it returns a list of the keys of the dictionary d using the keys() method and converting the result to a list. The keys of the dictionary d are 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan', so the function will return these values as a list.
