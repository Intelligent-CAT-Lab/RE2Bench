Let's analyze the `use_required_attribute` method step by step.

The method is defined as:
```python
def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
    return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial)
```

Given the input:
- `self` has an attribute `attrs` which is an empty dictionary (`{}`).
- `initial` is `null`.

First, `super().use_required_attribute(initial)` is called. Since `self` is an instance of `FileInput`, which inherits from `Input`, we need to look at the implementation of `use_required_attribute` in the parent class `Input`.

Assuming the parent class `Input`'s `use_required_attribute` method checks if the `required` attribute is set in `self.attrs` or if the field is required in some other way. However, since `self.attrs` is empty and there's no indication that the field is required elsewhere, `super().use_required_attribute(initial)` likely returns `False`.

Next, the expression `(not initial)` is evaluated. Since `initial` is `null`, which is considered falsy in Python, `(not initial)` evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, the entire expression `super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial)` becomes `False and True`, which results in `False`.
