Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what the function `f` returns when given the inputs `s = "abc"` and `amount = 8`. 

The function is defined as `def f(s, amount): return (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s`. 

So first, I should calculate the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is "abc", its length is 3. 

Then, subtract that length from `amount`, which is 8. That gives 8 - 3 = 5. 

Multiply the string 'z' by 5, which results in "zzzzz". 

Finally, concatenate "zzzzz" with "abc", giving "zzzzzabc". 

That should be the output.

"zzzzzabc"
