Let's walk through the execution of the `change_base` function step by step for the input `x = 4` and `base = 5`.

1. The function is called with `x = 4` and `base = 5`. The variable `ret` is initialized as an empty string: `ret = ''`.

2. The loop condition `while x > 0` is checked. Since `x` is 4, which is greater than 0, the loop body is executed.
   - `x % base` is `4 % 5`, which equals 4. This value is converted to a string and prepended to `ret`, so `ret` becomes `'4'`.
   - `x //= base` is `4 // 5`, which equals 0. So `x` is now 0.

3. The loop condition `while x > 0` is checked again. Since `x` is now 0, the loop terminates.

4. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is `'4'`.
