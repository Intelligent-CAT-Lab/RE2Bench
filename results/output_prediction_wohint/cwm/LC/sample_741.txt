Let's walk through the execution of the given Python function step by step:

1. The function `f` is called with the arguments `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` and `p = 6`.
2. Inside the function, `prev_p` is assigned the value of `p - 1`. So, `prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5`.
3. Since `prev_p` (which is 5) is not less than 0, the `if prev_p < 0:` condition is skipped.
4. The function returns `nums[prev_p]`, which is equivalent to `nums[5]`.

In the list `nums`, the element at index 5 is `1`. Therefore, the function returns `1`.
