The function `decimal_to_binary` is called with the input `decimal=0`. 

1. The input `0` is passed to the `bin()` function, which converts a decimal number to its binary representation as a string. The result of `bin(0)` is `'0b0'`.
2. The code then slices the string starting from the third character (`[2:]`), which removes the `'0b'` prefix. This results in the string `'0'`.
3. The function then concatenates the string `'db'` before and after the result from the previous step. This results in the string `'db' + '0' + 'db'`, which evaluates to `'db0db'`.
4. The function returns this result.
