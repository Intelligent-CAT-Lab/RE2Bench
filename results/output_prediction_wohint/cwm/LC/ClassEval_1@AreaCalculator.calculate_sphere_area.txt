The `calculate_sphere_area` method computes the surface area of a sphere using the formula `4 * π * r^2`, where `r` is the radius of the sphere.

Given that `self.radius` is 2, we can substitute `r = 2` into the formula:
`4 * π * 2^2 = 4 * π * 4 = 16 * π`

The value of π is approximately 3.14159. Multiplying 16 by π gives approximately 50.26548.

Therefore, the output of `calculate_sphere_area` will be the computed surface area of the sphere with the given radius.
