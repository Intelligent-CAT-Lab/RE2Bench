OK, let's see. I need to figure out what the function `calc_max_rows_first` returns when called with `max_rows=12`. The function is defined as:

def calc_max_rows_first(max_rows: int) -> int:
    return max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2

Hmm, let's break this down. The function takes an integer `max_rows` and returns an integer. The calculation is done in two parts: integer division of `max_rows` by 2, and then adding the remainder of `max_rows` divided by 2 (which is the modulus operator, `%`).

Let me plug in the value 12 for `max_rows`.

First part: `max_rows // 2` is 12 divided by 2 using integer division. 12 divided by 2 is exactly 6, so that part is 6.

Second part: `max_rows % 2` is the remainder when 12 is divided by 2. Since 12 is even, the remainder is 0.

Adding those two results together: 6 + 0 equals 6.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The formula is `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2`. For even numbers, the modulus is 0, so it's just half of max_rows. For odd numbers, say 13, it would be 6 + 1 = 7. So this function seems to be rounding up to the nearest integer when dividing by 2. But for even numbers, it's exactly half. So for 12, it's 6. That makes sense.

So the output should be 6.
