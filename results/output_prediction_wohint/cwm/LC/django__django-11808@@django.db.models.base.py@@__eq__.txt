1. `self` and `other` are instances of the same class, so `self._meta.concrete_model == other._meta.concrete_model` is True. This condition passes.
2. `self.pk` is accessed, which in turn calls the `_get_pk_val` method. This method retrieves the value of the primary key field (in this case, `id`).
3. Since both `self` and `other` have `id` equal to 1, the comparison `my_pk == other.pk` evaluates to True.
