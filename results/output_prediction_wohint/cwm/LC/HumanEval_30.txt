The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements from `l`.

Given the input list `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`, we need to filter out elements that are greater than 0.

Let's step through the list:

- The first element is -1, which is not greater than 0, so it is excluded.
- The second element is -2, which is not greater than 0, so it is excluded.
- The third element is 4, which is greater than 0, so it is included.
- The fourth element is 5, which is greater than 0, so it is included.
- The fifth element is 6, which is greater than 0, so it is included.

Therefore, the resulting list will contain the elements [4, 5, 6].
