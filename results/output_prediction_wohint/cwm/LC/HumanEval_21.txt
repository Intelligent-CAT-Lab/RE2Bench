Let's analyze the execution of the `rescale_to_unit` function with the provided input.

1. The function is called with the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` as the `numbers` argument.
2. The variable `min_number` is assigned the smallest value in the list. Since the smallest value is `1.0`, `min_number = 1.0`.
3. The variable `max_number` is assigned the largest value in the list. Since the largest value is `5.0`, `max_number = 5.0`.
4. The function then uses a list comprehension to compute the rescaled values. The formula for each element `x` in `numbers` is `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`.
   - For `x = 1.0`: `(1.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 0.0 / 4.0 = 0.0`
   - For `x = 2.0`: `(2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.25`
   - For `x = 3.0`: `(3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 2.0 / 4.0 = 0.5`
   - For `x = 4.0`: `(4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 3.0 / 4.0 = 0.75`
   - For `x = 5.0`: `(5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 4.0 / 4.0 = 1.0`
5. The resulting list after applying the formula is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

This is the output of the function for the given input.
