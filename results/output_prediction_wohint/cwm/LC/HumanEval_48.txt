Let's go through the execution of the `is_palindrome` function step by step for the input "xywzx".

1. The function is called with `text = "xywzx"`.
2. The for loop iterates over the range of the length of the string, which is 5. So `i` will take values from 0 to 4.
3. For `i = 0`, the first character is `text[0] = 'x'` and the last character is `text[4] = 'x'`. They match, so the loop continues.
4. For `i = 1`, the second character is `text[1] = 'y'` and the second last character is `text[3] = 'z'`. These do not match.
5. Since the characters at positions 1 and 3 do not match, the function returns `False`.
6. The loop does not proceed further since the function has already returned a value.
