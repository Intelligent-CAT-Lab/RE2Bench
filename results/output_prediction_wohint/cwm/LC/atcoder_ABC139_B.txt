Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The code `t, h = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two values, and converts them into integers. Given the input `"8 9"`, `t` becomes 8 and `h` becomes 9.

2. The code `print((h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1)` calculates the expression:
   - First, subtract 2 from `h`: 9 - 2 = 7.
   - Then, subtract 1 from `t`: 8 - 1 = 7.
   - Perform integer division of the two results: 7 // 7 = 1.
   - Add 1 to the result: 1 + 1 = 2.
   
Therefore, the output is 2.
