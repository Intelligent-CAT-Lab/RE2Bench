Let's go through the code execution step by step.

The function `make_a_pile` is called with the argument `n=3`. 

The function uses a list comprehension: `[n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]`. 

Breaking this down:

1. `range(n)` will generate the numbers 0, 1, and 2 because `n` is 3.
2. For each value of `i` in the range (0, 1, 2), the expression `n + 2 * i` is calculated.
   - When `i=0`, the value is `3 + 2*0 = 3`.
   - When `i=1`, the value is `3 + 2*1 = 5`.
   - When `i=2`, the value is `3 + 2*2 = 7`.
3. The resulting list is `[3, 5, 7]`.

So, the final output of the function is `[3, 5, 7]`.
