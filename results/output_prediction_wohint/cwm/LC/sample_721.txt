Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. The function `f` is defined to take a list `nums`.
2. The variable `count` is assigned the length of `nums`, which is 5.
3. A `for` loop is initiated with `num` taking values from 2 up to, but not including, `count` (i.e., 2, 3, 4).
4. Inside the loop, the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order on each iteration.

- First iteration (num = 2):
  The original list is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]. Sorting it results in [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].

- Second iteration (num = 3):
  The list is already sorted, so sorting again doesn't change it. The list remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].

- Third iteration (num = 4):
  Again, the list is already sorted, so sorting doesn't change it. The list remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].

5. After the loop completes, the sorted list `nums` is returned.

The final state of `nums` is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
