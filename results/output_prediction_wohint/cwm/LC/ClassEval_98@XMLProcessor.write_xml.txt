Step-by-step analysis:
1. The `write_xml` method is called on an instance of `XMLProcessor` with a file name of an empty string.
2. Inside `write_xml`, the code tries to create an `ElementTree` object using `self.root`, which is `None`.
3. Since `self.root` is `None`, `ET.ElementTree(self.root)` will raise a `ValueError` because `ElementTree` expects an Element instance, not `None`.
4. The exception is caught by the general `except` block, and the method returns `False`.
