Okay, let's go through this step by step. The input provided is "1 1". First, the code splits this input into a list of strings. So x becomes ["1", "1"]. Then, each element in x is converted to an integer, so x is now [1, 1]. The variable a is assigned x[0], which is 1, and b is assigned x[1], which is also 1. 

Next, the code prints the minimum value in x, which is 1, followed by a space. Then it checks if the absolute difference between a and b is greater than or equal to 2. Since a and b are both 1, the absolute difference is 0, which is less than 2. So it prints 0. 

Putting it all together, the output should be "1 0".
