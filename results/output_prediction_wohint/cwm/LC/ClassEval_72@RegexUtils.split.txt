Let's break down the function call step by step.

1. The function `split` is called with two arguments:
   - `pattern`: "\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b"
   - `text`: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

2. The `split` function calls `re.split(pattern, text)`. 

3. The pattern "\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b" is a regular expression that matches US phone numbers (3 digits, hyphen, 3 digits, hyphen, 4 digits) surrounded by word boundaries.

4. The `text` string contains the following substrings that match the pattern:
   - "123-456-7890"
   - "876-286-9876"
   - "987-762-9767"

5. The `re.split()` function splits the `text` string at each occurrence of these phone numbers, and returns a list of substrings:
   - The substring before the first phone number (which is empty in this case)
   - The substring between the first and second phone numbers: " abiguygusu "
   - The substring between the second and third phone numbers: " kjgufwycs "
   - The substring after the third phone number (which is empty in this case)

Therefore, the output of the `split` function is a list containing the following elements: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].
