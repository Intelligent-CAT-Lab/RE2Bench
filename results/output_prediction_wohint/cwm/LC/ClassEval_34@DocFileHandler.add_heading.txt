I need to predict the output of the `add_heading` method given the input. Let's start by understanding the method step by step.

1. The `add_heading` method is part of the `DocFileHandler` class. It takes two arguments: `heading` and `level` (defaulting to 1 if not provided).
2. The method attempts to open a document using `docx.Document(self.file_path)`, where `self.file_path` is "test_example.docx".
3. It then tries to add a heading with the provided text and level to the document.
4. After adding the heading, it saves the document back to the same file path.
5. If all operations are successful, the method returns `True`. If any exception occurs during this process, it returns `False`.

Now, let's consider the input provided:
- The file path is "test_example.docx".
- The heading to be added is "Test Heading 5".
- The level is not specified, so it defaults to 1.

Assuming that the file "test_example.docx" exists and is accessible, and there are no issues with writing to it, the method should successfully add the heading and return `True`. However, if the file does not exist, is corrupted, or there's a permissions issue, an exception would be raised, and the method would return `False`.

Since the problem doesn't mention any issues with the file, I'll assume the operation is successful.
