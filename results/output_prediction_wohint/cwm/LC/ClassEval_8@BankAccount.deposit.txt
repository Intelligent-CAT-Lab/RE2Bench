Let's go through the code step by step.

1. The `BankAccount` class is defined with an initializer `__init__` that sets the balance to 0 by default.
2. The `deposit` method is defined to add a positive amount to the balance.

Now, let's simulate the execution of the `deposit` method with the given input.

The `self` object has a `balance` of 0, and the `amount` to deposit is 300.

1. Inside the `deposit` method, the `if amount < 0` condition checks if the amount is negative. Since 300 is not less than 0, this condition is false, and the code does not raise a `ValueError`.
2. The line `self.balance += amount` adds 300 to the current balance (0), resulting in a new balance of 300.
3. The `return self.balance` statement returns the updated balance, which is 300.

Therefore, the output of the `deposit` method is 300.
