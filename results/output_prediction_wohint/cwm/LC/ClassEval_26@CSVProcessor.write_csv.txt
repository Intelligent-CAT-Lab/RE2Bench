The function `write_csv` begins by entering its execution scope with the provided arguments: `data` is a list containing two sublists, and `file_name` is "read_test_process.csv". 

It enters a `try` block and attempts to open the file "read_test_process.csv" in write mode with newline handling. The file is successfully opened, and a `csv.writer` object is created to write data to this file. The `writerows` method is then called with `data`, which writes the contents of the `data` list into the CSV file. The first sublist ["a", "b", "c", "d"] becomes the header row, and the second sublist ["ME"] becomes the first data row in the CSV file.

After successfully writing the data, the `with` block ensures the file is properly closed. The function then returns 1 to indicate success.

If any exception had occurred during file operations, the function would have returned 0. However, since the file operations were successful, the return value is 1.
