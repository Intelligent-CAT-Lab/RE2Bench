Let's go through the execution of the `bf` function with the given input.

1. The function is called with `planet1="Earth"` and `planet2="Earth"`.
2. The variable `planet_names` is assigned the tuple of planet names in order.
3. The function checks if either `planet1` or `planet2` is not in the `planet_names` tuple, or if they are the same planet. Since `planet1` and `planet2` are both "Earth", the condition `planet1 == planet2` is true.
4. As a result, the function immediately returns an empty tuple `()`.

The function does not proceed to calculate indices or attempt to slice the `planet_names` tuple because the early return is triggered due to the planets being the same.
