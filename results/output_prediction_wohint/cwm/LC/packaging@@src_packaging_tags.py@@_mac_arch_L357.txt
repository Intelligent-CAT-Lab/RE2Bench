Step 1: The function `_mac_arch` is called with arguments `arch='x86_64'` and `is_32bit=True`.
Step 2: The first condition checks if `is_32bit` is False. Since `is_32bit` is True, this condition is not met, and we move to the next condition.
Step 3: The next condition checks if `arch` starts with 'ppc'. Since `arch` is 'x86_64', this condition is not met, and we proceed to the next line.
Step 4: The function returns 'i386' as the default case when the previous conditions are not satisfied.
