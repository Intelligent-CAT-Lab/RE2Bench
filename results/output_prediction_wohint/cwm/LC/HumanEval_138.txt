Let's break down the execution of the function step by step.

1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` is defined to take one parameter `n`.
2. The function checks if `n` is even using the condition `n % 2 == 0`.
3. Additionally, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 using the condition `n >= 8`.
4. The function returns the logical AND of these two conditions.
5. In this case, the input is `n = 10`.
6. Since 10 is even (`10 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`) and 10 is greater than or equal to 8 (`10 >= 8` also evaluates to `True`), the logical AND of these conditions is `True`.
7. Therefore, the function will return `True`.
