The code starts by reading an input from the user and converting it to an integer. In this case, the input is "1". The code then checks if the input integer is equal to 1. Since the input is 1, the condition is true, and the code prints 0. The code does not enter the else branch because the condition is met. Therefore, the output of the code will be 0.
