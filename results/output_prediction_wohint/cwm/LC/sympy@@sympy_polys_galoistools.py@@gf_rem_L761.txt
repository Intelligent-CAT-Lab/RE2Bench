The function `gf_rem` calls `gf_div` with the given arguments `f`, `g`, `p`, and `K`. Here, `f` represents the polynomial 2x + 0, `g` represents the polynomial x² + 0x + 1, `p` is 3, and `K` is the integer domain `ZZ`. The goal of `gf_div` is to find the quotient and remainder when `f` is divided by `g` in the finite field GF(3).

Let's walk through the steps of the execution:

1. **Calculate degrees of polynomials**:
   - `f` has a degree of 1 (since the highest power of x is 1).
   - `g` has a degree of 2 (since the highest power of x is 2).

2. **Check for division by zero**:
   - Since `g` is not empty, division is valid.

3. **Check if degree of `f` is less than degree of `g`**:
   - Since 1 < 2, the remainder is simply `f`, and the quotient is an empty list.

4. **Return the quotient and remainder**:
   - The quotient is an empty list `[]`.
   - The remainder is `f` itself, which is `[2, 0]`.

Now, the remainder returned by `gf_div` is stripped of leading zeros. Since `gf_strip` removes leading zeros from a polynomial, it returns `[2, 0]`.

Thus, the result of `gf_rem` is `[2, 0]`.
