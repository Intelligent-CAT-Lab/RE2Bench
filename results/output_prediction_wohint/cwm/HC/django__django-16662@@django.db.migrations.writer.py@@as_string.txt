Let's go through the `as_string` method step by step.

1. Initialize `items` dictionary with 'replaces_str' and 'initial_str' set to empty strings.
2. Initialize `imports` as an empty set and `operations` as an empty list.
3. The `for` loop over `self.migration.operations` is skipped because `operations` is `null`.
4. `items['operations']` is set to an empty string.
5. The `for` loop over `self.migration.dependencies` is skipped because `dependencies` is not provided in the input.
6. `items['dependencies']` is set to an empty string.
7. The `for` loop over `imports` is skipped because `imports` is an empty set.
8. Since 'from django.db import models' is not in `imports`, 'from django.db import migrations' is added to `imports`.
9. `sorted_imports` is sorted and set to ['from django.db import migrations'].
10. `items['imports']` is set to 'from django.db import migrations\n'.
11. The `if migration_imports` block is skipped because `migration_imports` is an empty set.
12. The `if self.migration.replaces` block is skipped because `replaces` is not provided in the input.
13. Since `self.include_header` is `false`, `items['migration_header']` is set to an empty string.
14. The `if self.migration.initial` block is skipped because `initial` is not provided in the input.
15. Finally, `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` is formatted with `items` and returned.
