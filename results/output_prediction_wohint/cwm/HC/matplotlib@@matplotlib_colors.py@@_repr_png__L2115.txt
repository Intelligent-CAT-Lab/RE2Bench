1. The `_repr_png_` method is called for a `BivarColormap` instance named "BiCone". 
2. Since `self._isinit` is `False`, the method proceeds to call `self._init()`. This initializes the colormap's `_lut` attribute by resampling a patch image into a lookup table.
3. After initializing, the method retrieves the LUT and adjusts it based on the shape (in this case, a circle). This involves creating a mask for areas outside the circle and setting their alpha channel to 0.
4. The LUT is then resized to a 256x256 resolution to prepare it for PNG representation.
5. The pixels are converted to a uint8 format and stored in a BytesIO buffer.
6. Metadata such as title, description, and author are added to the PNG image using the PngInfo class.
7. Finally, the image is saved to the buffer and returned as a byte string.

The function `self._init()` initializes the internal LUT, ensuring the colormap is properly set up for display. The `_repr_png_` method then generates a PNG image representation of the colormap, applying necessary adjustments for the circular shape and converting the data into the appropriate format.
