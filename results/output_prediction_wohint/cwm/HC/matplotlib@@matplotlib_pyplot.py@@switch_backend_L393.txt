Let's go step by step through the execution of the `switch_backend` function with the input `newbackend="Agg"`.

1. **Global Backend Variable**: The function starts by declaring `global _backend_mod`, indicating that it will modify a global variable `_backend_mod`.

2. **Import Backend Module**: The function imports `matplotlib.backends` and checks if `newbackend` is the `_auto_backend_sentinel`. Since it's not, it proceeds to load the backend module using `backend_registry.load_backend_module(newbackend)`.

3. **Load Backend**: The `load_backend_module` function is called with `newbackend="Agg"`. This function will import the module for the "Agg" backend.

4. **Retrieve Canvas Class**: The `FigureCanvas` class is retrieved from the loaded module.

5. **Check Interactive Framework**: The function checks if the canvas class requires a specific interactive framework. If it does, it verifies that the currently running framework matches the required one. Since "Agg" is a non-interactive backend, this check is likely skipped.

6. **Update Figure Manager and Show Functions**: The function updates the `new_figure_manager` and `show` functions based on the backend module. For "Agg", these might be default implementations or None.

7. **Create Backend Module**: A new class `backend_mod` is created, which inherits from `_Backend` and updates its locals with the variables from the loaded backend module.

8. **Update Global Backend**: The function sets `rcParams['backend']` and `rcParamsDefault['backend']` to "Agg", indicating that the backend has been switched.

9. **Install REPL Display Hook**: Finally, the function calls `install_repl_displayhook()` to set up the display hook for the current shell, which is used to update figures in interactive mode.

Since the input is `newbackend="Agg"`, the function will switch the backend to "Agg" and update the global backend module accordingly. There is no explicit return value mentioned in the code, so the output is likely `None`.
