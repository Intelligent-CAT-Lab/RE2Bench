Let's go through the `_osborne` function step by step with the given input.

The input expression is "-\"sinh(x)\" + \"cosh(x)\"*tanh(x)". We can parse this as the SymPy expression `-sinh(x) + cosh(x)*tanh(x)`.

1. The function `_osborne` takes two arguments: `e` (the expression) and `d` (a multiplier). In this case, `d` is not provided, so it defaults to `1`.

2. Inside `_osborne`, there's a nested function `f` that performs the actual transformation on hyperbolic functions.

3. The function uses `bottom_up(e, f)` to apply the transformation `f` to all subexpressions of `e` in a bottom-up manner.

4. Let's analyze how `f` works on each part of the expression:

   a. For `-sinh(x)`: Since `sinh` is a hyperbolic function, it gets transformed using `f`. The argument `x` is multiplied by `d` (which is 1), resulting in `I * sin(x)`. The negative sign is preserved, so this becomes `-I * sin(x)`.

   b. For `cosh(x)`: This is also a hyperbolic function. It gets transformed to `cos(x)`.

   c. For `tanh(x)`: Another hyperbolic function, transformed to `I * tan(x)`.

5. Now, let's combine these transformed parts:

   a. `-sinh(x)` becomes `-I * sin(x)`
   b. `cosh(x)` becomes `cos(x)`
   c. `tanh(x)` becomes `I * tan(x)`

6. The original expression was `-sinh(x) + cosh(x)*tanh(x)`. Substituting the transformed parts, we get:
   `-I * sin(x) + cos(x) * (I * tan(x))`

7. Simplify the expression:
   `-I * sin(x) + I * cos(x) * tan(x)`

8. Recall that `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)`, so `cos(x) * tan(x) = sin(x)`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
   `-I * sin(x) + I * sin(x)`

9. These two terms are opposites and cancel each other out, resulting in `0`.
