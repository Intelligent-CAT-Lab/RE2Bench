The function `_eval_is_rational` is part of the `Pow` class. Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the input `cos(phi)**2`:

1. `self.exp.is_integer` is checked. In this case, the exponent is `2`, so `self.exp.is_integer` returns `True`.
2. Next, `self.base.is_rational` is checked. The base is `cos(phi)`, which is not a rational number because it's a trigonometric function. Therefore, `self.base.is_rational` returns `False`.
3. The condition `fuzzy_not(fuzzy_and([self.exp.is_negative, self.base.is_zero]))` checks if the exponent is not negative and the base is not zero. Since the exponent `2` is positive, `self.exp.is_negative` is `False`. The base `cos(phi)` could be zero depending on the value of `phi`, but in general, it's not considered zero. However, since `self.base.is_rational` is already `False`, this part of the condition doesn't affect the overall outcome.
4. Since `self.base.is_rational` is `False`, the function returns `False` immediately.

Therefore, the output of the `_eval_is_rational` function is `False`.
