1. The `_eval_expand_mul` method is called on the instance "-sin(phi)**2".
2. It first computes the fraction of the expression using the `fraction` function.
3. In the `fraction` function, the expression is converted to a pair of numerator and denominator.
   For the expression "-sin(phi)**2", the numerator is "-sin(phi)**2" and the denominator is 1.
4. Since neither the numerator nor the denominator is an instance of `Mul`, the variables `n` and `d` are assigned the values "-sin(phi)**2" and 1 respectively.
5. The expression is then simplified by dividing the numerator by the denominator, resulting in the same expression "-sin(phi)**2".
6. Since the simplified expression is not an instance of `Mul`, it is returned as is.
