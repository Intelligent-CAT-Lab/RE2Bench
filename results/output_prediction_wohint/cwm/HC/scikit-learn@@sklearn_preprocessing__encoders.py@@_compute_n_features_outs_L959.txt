Step 1: The function `_compute_n_features_outs` is called on an instance of the `OneHotEncoder` class.

Step 2: The first line of the function is `output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]`. This line computes the length of each category in `self.categories_` and stores the lengths in the `output` list. Since `self.categories_` is `["array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)"]`, the length of the only category is 2. Therefore, `output` becomes `[2]`.

Step 3: The next line checks if `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is not `None`. Since `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is `null`, the condition is false, and this block is skipped.

Step 4: The next line checks if `self._infrequent_enabled` is false. Since `self._infrequent_enabled` is `false`, the condition is true, and the function returns the `output` list as is, which is `[2]`.
