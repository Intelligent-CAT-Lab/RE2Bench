Step 1: The `extract` method is called with `rows = [0, 1, 2]` and `cols = [0]`. Since the input SDM is empty and the rows and columns lists are non-empty, the method proceeds to the next steps.

Step 2: The shape of the input SDM is `(3, 3)`, so `m = 3` and `n = 3`. The method checks that the row and column indices are within the valid range.

Step 3: The `rowmap` and `colmap` dictionaries are created to map the new indices to the old indices. For `rows = [0, 1, 2]`, `rowmap` becomes `{0: [0], 1: [1], 2: [2]}`. For `cols = [0]`, `colmap` becomes `{0: [0]}`.

Step 4: The `rowset` and `colset` are created as sets of keys from `rowmap` and `colmap`, respectively. So, `rowset = {0, 1, 2}` and `colset = {0}`.

Step 5: The method iterates over the intersection of `rowset` and the keys of the input SDM (which is empty). Since there are no common keys, the loop does not execute, and `sdm2` remains an empty dictionary.

Step 6: The method calls `self.new(sdm2, (len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)` to create a new SDM object with the extracted elements. Since `sdm2` is empty, the new SDM object will also be empty.

Step 7: The new SDM object is returned as the result of the `extract` method.
