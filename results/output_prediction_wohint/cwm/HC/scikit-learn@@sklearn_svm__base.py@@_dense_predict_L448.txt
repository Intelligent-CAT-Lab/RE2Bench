Step 1: Inside the _dense_predict method, we start by computing the kernel on the input X using the _compute_kernel method.
Step 2: Since the kernel is 'rbf' (not callable), the kernel remains unchanged. We then check if X is 1-dimensional and convert it to a numpy array with order='C'.
Step 3: The kernel type is determined as 'rbf' and the svm_type is determined by finding the index of the _impl attribute in the LIBSVM_IMPL list.
Step 4: Finally, we call the libsvm.predict function with the computed kernel, support vectors, dual coefficients, intercepts, and other parameters to obtain the prediction.
