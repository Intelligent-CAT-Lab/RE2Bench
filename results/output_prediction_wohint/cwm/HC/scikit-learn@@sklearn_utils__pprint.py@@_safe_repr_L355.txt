1. The function `_safe_repr` is called with `object` as "dictionary", `context` as {"124132985094608": 1}, `maxlevels` as null, `level` as 1, and `changed_only` as True.
2. Since `typ` (type of object) is a string (`<class 'str'>`), it is in `pprint._builtin_scalars`, so it returns `(repr(object), True, False)`.
3. The `repr(object)` for the string "dictionary" is "'dictionary'". Therefore, the function returns `("'dictionary'", True, False)`.
