Step 1: The function `dmp_sub` is called with `f = []`, `g = []`, `u = 0`, and `K = ZZ`.
Step 2: Since `u` is 0, the function will return `_dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K))`.
Step 3: `_dup(f)` and `_dup(g)` will return `[]` since `_dup` is the identity function.
Step 4: `dup_sub([], [], ZZ)` is called.
Step 5: In `dup_sub`, since both `f` and `g` are empty lists, the function returns `[]`.
Step 6: `_dmp([])` is called, which returns `[]` since `_dmp` is the identity function.
Step 7: The final result of `dmp_sub` is `[]`.
