The method `get_partition_for_region` takes a `region_name` argument and returns the partition for that region by calling `self._session.get_partition_for_region(region_name)`. 

Given the input, `region_name` is "foo-bar-1". The `_session` object is a mock object that returns a mock configuration when `get_config_variable()` is called. However, the exact return value of `get_partition_for_region("foo-bar-1")` depends on how the mock object is configured. Since the mock object's behavior isn't fully specified, we can't determine the exact output. But based on the code, it should return a partition object or raise an exception if the region is not found.

Assuming the mock object is properly configured to handle the region "foo-bar-1", the output would be the partition for that region. If not, it might raise an exception like `UnknownServiceError` or return `None`.
