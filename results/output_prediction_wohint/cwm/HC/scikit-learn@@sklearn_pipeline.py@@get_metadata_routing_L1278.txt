The function get_metadata_routing() is called on a Pipeline object. The Pipeline has one step, "consumesmetadata", which is an instance of ConsumesMetadata with on_fit=True and on_predict=True.

1. A new MetadataRouter is created, with the Pipeline object as its owner.
2. The function iterates over the steps of the Pipeline, excluding the final step (but in this case, there's only one step).
3. For the "consumesmetadata" step, a MethodMapping is created.
4. Since the step has no 'fit_transform' method, the following mappings are added to the MethodMapping:
   - fit -> fit
   - fit -> transform
   - fit_transform -> fit
   - fit_transform -> transform
   - fit_predict -> fit
   - fit_predict -> transform
   - predict -> transform
   - predict_proba -> transform
   - decision_function -> transform
   - predict_log_proba -> transform
   - transform -> transform
   - inverse_transform -> inverse_transform
   - score -> transform
5. The MethodMapping is then added to the MetadataRouter, along with the "consumesmetadata" step.
6. The final step is checked, but since it's the same as the only step, no additional mappings are added.
7. The completed MetadataRouter is returned.
