In the `to` method of `FunctionUnitBase`:
1. `other` is checked if it is equivalent to `self.physical_unit`. Since `other` is a UnitBase object and `self.physical_unit` is also a UnitBase object representing meters, `other` is equivalent to `self.physical_unit`. So we proceed with `self.to_physical(value)`.

2. Since `self.function_unit` is not equivalent to `other_function_unit` (which is the same as `other` here, a UnitBase object), we attempt to convert `value` from `self.physical_unit` to `other`.

3. `self.physical_unit.to(other, self.to_physical(value), equivalencies)` is called. Here, `self.physical_unit` and `other` are both meters, so this conversion should be straightforward. Since meters are the same unit, the value should remain the same after conversion.

4. The converted value is then returned as the result of the `to` method.
