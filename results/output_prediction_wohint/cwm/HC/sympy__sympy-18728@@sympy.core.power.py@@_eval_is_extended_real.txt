The provided function `_eval_is_extended_real` is a method within a class, likely used in symbolic mathematics. The goal of this function is to determine whether the expression it's applied to is an extended real number (which includes real numbers and ±∞).

Given the inputs:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

This seems to be a partial or incorrect input format for a Python function, particularly for the `_eval_is_extended_real` method. The method expects `self` to be an instance of a class that represents a mathematical expression, with various properties and methods defined (e.g., `is_extended_real`, `is_extended_positive`, etc.).

However, since the inputs are empty dictionaries for `self`, `args`, and `kwargs`, we cannot directly apply the method or predict its output without more context or correct initialization of the object.

Given the nature of the function and the typical use cases in symbolic mathematics, the function would usually check properties of `self` (the expression) to determine if it is an extended real number. This might involve checking if the expression is a number, if it's infinite, or if it can be evaluated to a real number.

Without specific details about the expression `self` represents, we can't accurately predict the output. However, if we were to speculate based on common scenarios:

1. If `self` is a simple number (like an integer, float, or a symbolic representation of a real number), the function might return `True`.
2. If `self` is an expression that cannot be simplified to a real number (e.g., involving complex numbers, undefined values, or symbolic variables), the function might return `False` or `None` indicating uncertainty.

Since the input provided does not specify the nature of `self`, we cannot give a definitive answer. The function's output would depend on the actual implementation details of the class and the specific expression being evaluated.
