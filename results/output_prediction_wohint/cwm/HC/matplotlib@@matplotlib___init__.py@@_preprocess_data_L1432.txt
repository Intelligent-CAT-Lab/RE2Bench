The function `_preprocess_data` is called with `func`, `replace_names`, and `label_namer` as arguments. The input `func` is a function object, and the output of `_preprocess_data` is another function (a wrapper around the original `func`) with modified behavior.

1. The function starts by checking if `func` is `None`. In this case, it is not, so it proceeds to inspect the signature of the `func` using `inspect.signature(func)`.
   
2. It initializes `varargs_name`, `varkwargs_name`, and `arg_names` to `None` and an empty list, respectively.

3. It then iterates over the parameters of the `func` to identify variable positional arguments (`*args`), variable keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), and normal arguments. In this case, the function `func_kwargs` has two parameters: `x` and `y`, which are both normal arguments.

4. A new parameter `data` is added to the function signature as a keyword-only parameter with a default value of `None`.

5. The modified function signature is created and stored in `new_sig`.

6. The `arg_names` list is sliced to exclude the first element, which is typically `ax` in the original function.

7. Two assertions are made to ensure that `replace_names` are valid and that `label_namer` is either `None` or one of the argument names.

8. A nested function `inner` is defined, which wraps the original `func`. This function takes `ax`, `*args`, `data=None`, and `**kwargs` as arguments.

9. Inside `inner`, if `data` is `None`, it calls the original `func` with sanitized arguments.

10. If `data` is not `None`, it binds the arguments to the modified signature and replaces certain arguments with values from `data` if they exist.

11. The function then calls the original `func` with the new arguments and keyword arguments.

12. The `inner` function's docstring is updated to include information about the `data` parameter using the `_add_data_doc` function.

13. Finally, the modified `inner` function is returned as the result of `_preprocess_data`.

Now, let's look at the specific input provided:

- `func` is a function object (`<function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs at 0x71b98961aca0>`).
- `replace_names` is a list containing `"x"` and `"y"`.
- `label_namer` is `None`.

Given these inputs, the function will create a wrapper around `func_kwargs` that allows the parameters `x` and `y` to be replaced by values from the `data` dictionary if provided.
