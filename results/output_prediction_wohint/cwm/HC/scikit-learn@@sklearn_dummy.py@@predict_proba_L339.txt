1. The `predict_proba` method is called with an input array `X` of shape (36, 1). The object has been initialized with `strategy='prior'`, `random_state=967609597`, and `constant=None`.
2. `check_is_fitted(self)` is called to ensure the classifier is fitted. Since the object has attributes like `n_features_in_`, `n_outputs_`, `classes_`, `n_classes_`, and `class_prior_`, it is considered fitted.
3. The number of samples in `X` is determined using `_num_samples(X)`, which returns 36.
4. `check_random_state(self.random_state)` is called with `self.random_state=967609597`, resulting in a `RandomState` object seeded with 967609597.
5. Since `self.n_outputs_ == 1`, the class-related attributes are wrapped into lists: `n_classes_ = [3]`, `classes_ = [array([0, 1, 2])]`, `class_prior_ = [array([0.33928571, 0.33035714, 0.33035714])]`, and `constant = [None]`.
6. An empty list `P` is initialized to store the probability outputs for each output.
7. A loop runs for `self.n_outputs_` (which is 1), so it executes once.
8. Inside the loop, since `self._strategy == 'prior'`, the code calculates `out = np.ones((n_samples, 1)) * class_prior_[k]`. This creates an array of shape (36, 1) where each element is the class prior [0.33928571, 0.33035714, 0.33035714] repeated 36 times.
9. The resulting `out` array is appended to `P`.
10. Since `self.n_outputs_ == 1`, `P` is unwrapped to a single array, which is returned as the output of `predict_proba`.
