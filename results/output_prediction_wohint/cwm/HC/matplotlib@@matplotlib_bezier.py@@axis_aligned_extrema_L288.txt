The `axis_aligned_extrema` function is called on a BezierSegment object with `_N` equal to 1. This means the Bezier curve has only one control point, resulting in a linear curve. 

1. The function starts by checking if the degree `n` is less than or equal to 1. Since `_N` is 1, the degree `n` is 0, which satisfies this condition.
2. As a result, the function immediately returns a tuple of two empty arrays: `(np.array([]), np.array([]))`. This is because linear curves do not have any extrema points within their range [0, 1].
