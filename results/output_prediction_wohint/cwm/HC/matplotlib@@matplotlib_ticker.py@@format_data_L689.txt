Let's walk through the step-by-step execution of `format_data` with the given input.

1. The function `format_data` is called with `value=0.11`.

2. Calculate the exponent `e` as `math.floor(math.log10(abs(0.11)))`.
   - `math.log10(0.11)` is approximately -0.958, so `math.floor` makes it `-1`.
   - Therefore, `e = -1`.

3. Calculate the significand `s` as `round(value / 10 ** e, 10)`.
   - `10 ** -1` is `0.1`, so `0.11 / 0.1 = 1.1`.
   - Rounding `1.1` to 10 decimal places remains `1.1`.
   - Thus, `s = 1.1`.

4. Format the significand using `self._format_maybe_minus_and_locale('%1.10g', s)`.
   - Since `s` is not an integer (`s % 1 != 0`), the format `%1.10g` is used.
   - However, `s` is `1.1`, which is not an integer, but in this case, the format `%1.10g` will result in `1.1`.
   - Therefore, `significand = '1.1'`.

5. Since `e != 0`, we proceed to format the exponent.
   - Format `e` using `self._format_maybe_minus_and_locale('%d', e)`.
   - `e` is `-1`, so the formatted exponent is `'-1'`.

6. Check if `self._useMathText` or `self._usetex` is `True`.
   - Both are `False` in the given input, so we use the non-math text format.

7. Combine the significand and exponent in the format `f'{significand}e{exponent}'`.
   - This results in `'1.1e-1'`.

So, the final output of `format_data` is `'1.1e-1'`.
