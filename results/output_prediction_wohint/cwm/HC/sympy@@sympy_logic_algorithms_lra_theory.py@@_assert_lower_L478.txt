1. At the beginning of `_assert_lower`, the function checks if `self.result` is not None. Since `self.result` is None, it proceeds to set `self.result` to None and continues.

2. The function then checks if `ci` (which is (0, 0)) is less than or equal to `xi.lower`. Assuming `xi.lower` is not less than `ci`, the function continues.

3. Next, it checks if `ci` is greater than `xi.upper`. If this condition is true, it would generate a conflict and return a result indicating a conflict. However, since `ci` is (0, 0) and assuming `xi.upper` is not less than `ci`, this condition is not met.

4. The function then updates `xi.lower` to `ci` and sets `xi.lower_from_eq` to `from_equality` (which is True) and `xi.lower_from_neg` to `from_neg` (which is False).

5. Since `xi` is in `self.nonslack` and `xi.assign` is less than `ci`, the function calls `_update(xi, ci)` to update the slack variables.

6. After updating, if `self.run_checks` is True and all variables in `self.all_var` have finite assignments, the function performs an assertion to check if the product of matrix `M` (which is `self.A`) and vector `X` (which contains the assignments of all variables) is close to zero. However, since `self.run_checks` is False, this assertion is skipped.

7. Finally, the function returns None.
