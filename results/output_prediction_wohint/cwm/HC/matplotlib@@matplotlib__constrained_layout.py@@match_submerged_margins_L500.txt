The `match_submerged_margins` function is called with a figure that has two axes, both located in a GridSpec layout. The function iterates over the axes and their corresponding subplot specs to adjust the margins between subplots.

1. The `axsdone` list is initialized to keep track of axes that have already been processed. Since there are no subfigures, this list remains empty.
2. A list `axs` is created containing the two axes of the figure. Each axis is associated with a SubplotSpec from the GridSpec layout.
3. The function then enters a loop over each axis in `axs`. For each axis, it retrieves its SubplotSpec and corresponding layout grid.
4. It checks the colspan and rowspan of the SubplotSpec. However, in this case, both axes have a colspan of 1 and a rowspan of 1, meaning they do not span multiple columns or rows. As a result, the conditions `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1` and `if len(ss1.rowspan) > 1` are false, and no margin adjustments are made.
5. After processing both axes, the function returns the `axs` list, which contains the two axes.

The key steps involved the initialization of `axsdone` and `axs`, followed by a loop over the axes to check their subplot specs. Since the axes do not span multiple columns or rows, no further processing is needed.
