I need to predict the output of the `_get_metadata_request` method given the input. Let's walk through the steps.

The method first checks if `self` has an attribute called `_metadata_request`. Since the input shows that `self` does have a `_metadata_request` attribute, the method proceeds to call `get_routing_for_object` with `self._metadata_request` as the argument.

Now, `get_routing_for_object` checks if the object has a `get_metadata_routing` method. If not, it checks if the object is already a `MetadataRequest` or `MetadataRouter` instance. If none of these conditions are met, it returns a new `MetadataRequest` instance with `owner=None`. However, since the input shows that `self._metadata_request` is a dictionary-like object, which is not an instance of `MetadataRequest` or `MetadataRouter`, and it doesn't have a `get_metadata_routing` method, `get_routing_for_object` will return a new `MetadataRequest` instance with `owner=None`.

Therefore, the `_get_metadata_request` method returns this new `MetadataRequest` instance.
