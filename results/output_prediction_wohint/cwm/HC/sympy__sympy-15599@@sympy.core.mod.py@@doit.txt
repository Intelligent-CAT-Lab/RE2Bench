1. `doit` is called with `p=2*t` and `q=t`.
2. The first check is if `q` is zero, but `q=t` is not zero.
3. It checks for infinite values or NaN, but neither `p` nor `q` are infinite or NaN.
4. It then checks if `p` is zero, equal to `q`, or if `p` is an integer and `q` is 1. None of these conditions are true.
5. It checks if `q` is a number, but `q=t` is a symbol, not a number.
6. It then tries to call `_eval_Mod` on `p`, but `p=2*t` does not have this method.
7. The function calculates `r = p / q`, which is `2*t / t = 2`. It attempts to convert `r` to an integer, which succeeds and gives `d=2`.
8. Since `d` is an integer, it calculates `rv = p - d * q` which is `2*t - 2*t = 0`.
9. The function then checks if `(rv * q < 0)`, but since `rv` is zero, this condition is false.
10. The function returns `rv` which is zero.
