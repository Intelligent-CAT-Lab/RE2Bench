1. The function `_get_running_interactive_framework` is called with no arguments.
2. It attempts to import `PyQt6.QtWidgets`, `PySide6.QtWidgets`, `PyQt5.QtWidgets`, and `PySide2.QtWidgets` modules, in that order. If none are found, it continues.
3. Then, it checks if `Gtk` (from `gi.repository.Gtk`) is imported and if the GTK main loop is running (for GTK 4 or 3).
4. If `Gtk` is not found or the main loop is not running, it checks for the presence of `wx` (wxPython) and whether an application instance exists.
5. Next, it checks if the `tkinter` module is imported and if the Tkinter main loop is running by inspecting the current call stack.
6. It then checks if the `matplotlib.backends._macosx` module is present and if the macOS event loop is running.
7. Finally, if none of the above frameworks are detected, it checks if a valid display is available using `_c_internal_utils.display_is_valid()`. If not, it returns `'headless'`.
8. If all checks fail, the function returns `None`.

Since all the checks for interactive frameworks are likely to fail (assuming no specific GUI library is being used in the environment), the function will return `'headless'` if the display is not valid, otherwise it will return `None`.
