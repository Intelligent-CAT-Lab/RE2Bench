Step 1: The function `hpack` is called with parameters w=0.0 and m='additional'.
Step 2: The variables `h`, `d`, `x` are initialized to 0.0, and `total_stretch`, `total_shrink` are initialized to lists of four zeros.
Step 3: The loop iterates over the children of `self`. The first child is an Hlist with width 10.58, so `x` becomes 10.58, `h` becomes 13.0, and `d` remains 0.0.
Step 4: The second child is another Hlist with width 8.08. Since this child is an Hlist, its `shift_amount` is -7.0. The height and depth of the parent list are updated using the formula `h = max(h, p.height - s)` and `d = max(d, p.depth + s)`. So, `x` becomes 10.58 + 8.08 = 18.66, `h` remains 13.0, and `d` remains 0.0.
Step 5: Since m='additional', the parameter `w` is updated to w + x, which becomes 0.0 + 18.66 = 18.66.
Step 6: The variable `x` is updated to w - x, which becomes 18.66 - 18.66 = 0.0.
Step 7: Since x == 0.0, the function sets `self.glue_sign` to 0, `self.glue_order` to 0, and `self.glue_ratio` to 0.0, then returns.
