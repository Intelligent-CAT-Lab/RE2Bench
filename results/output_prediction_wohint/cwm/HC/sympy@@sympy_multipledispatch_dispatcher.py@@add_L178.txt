Since this is the add method of the Dispatcher class, we are expected to add a new type signature to it.
1. The code first checks if signature is empty. Since signature contains a type, we move forward.
2. Next, it checks if any type in the signature is a tuple. Since there's only one type, we proceed.
3. Then, it verifies if all elements in the signature are types. Here, signature contains a class type, so no error is raised.
4. The function (func) is then added to the funcs dictionary with the given signature as the key.
5. The reorder method is called to update the ordering of functions based on the new addition.
6. Finally, the cache is cleared.

There are no visible outputs or return values from this function call.
