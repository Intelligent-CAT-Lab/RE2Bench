Let's walk through the execution of the `__new__` method for the BlockMatrix class.

1. The `__new__` method is called with `cls` as the class (BlockMatrix), and `args` as a nested list of matrices.
2. The code checks if the first argument is a sequence (which it is, as it's a list of lists of matrices) and if all elements in the sequence are matrices.
3. It sets `rows` to the first argument (the list of lists of matrices).
4. Since `rows` is a list of lists of matrices, it proceeds to check if the block structure is valid.
5. It checks if all rows have the same number of columns, and all columns have the same number of rows. In this case, the first row has two matrices (with 2 and 3 columns respectively), and the second row also has two matrices (with 2 and 3 columns respectively). So, the block structure is valid.
6. It creates an `ImmutableDenseMatrix` object from the `rows` argument.
7. It creates a new `BlockMatrix` object using `Basic.__new__` and sets its `_args` attribute to the `rows` argument.
8. Finally, it returns the newly created `BlockMatrix` object.
