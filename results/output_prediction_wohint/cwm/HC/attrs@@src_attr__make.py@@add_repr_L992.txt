The function `add_repr` is being called on an instance of `_ClassBuilder` with the parameter `ns` set to `null`. The goal of this function is to generate a `__repr__` method for a class.

1. The function calls `_make_repr_script` with `self._attrs` and `ns=None`. This generates the source code for the `__repr__` method and the corresponding global variables.
2. `_make_repr_script` processes the attributes to determine which ones should be included in the `__repr__` output. It checks if the attribute has a custom representation function or if it should use the default `repr` function.
3. The function constructs the `__repr__` method as a string, including handling for recursive representations to avoid infinite loops.
4. The `__repr__` method is then added to the class dictionary with the correct module and qualname attributes set.
5. The `_repr_added` flag is set to `True` to indicate that a `__repr__` method has been added.
6. The function returns the `_ClassBuilder` instance itself, allowing method chaining.

Given that `ns` is `null`, the class name in the `__repr__` output will be determined dynamically using `self.__class__.__qualname__.rsplit(">.", 1)[-1]`.
