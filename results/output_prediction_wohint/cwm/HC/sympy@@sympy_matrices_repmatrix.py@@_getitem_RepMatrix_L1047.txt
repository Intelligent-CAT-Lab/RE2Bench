Let's walk through the execution of `_getitem_RepMatrix` step by step.

1. The function receives `self` as an object with properties:
   - `rows` = 3
   - `cols` = 3
   - `_rep` = `DomainMatrix({0: {0: cos(phi), 1: -sin(phi)}, 1: {0: sin(phi), 1: cos(phi)}, 2: {2: 1}}, (3, 3), EXRAW)`

   The `key` argument is a list `[0, 0]`.

2. Since `key` is a tuple (in this case, a list with two elements), the code sets `i = 0` and `j = 0`.

3. It then attempts to return `self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j))`.

   - `index_(i)` evaluates to `0` because `i` is `0`.
   - `index_(j)` also evaluates to `0` because `j` is `0`.

4. The function calls `self._rep.getitem_sympy(0, 0)`.

   - `self._rep` is a `DomainMatrix`, and its `getitem_sympy` method is defined to return `self.domain.to_sympy(self.rep.getitem(i, j))`.
   - `self.rep.getitem(0, 0)` accesses the element at row 0, column 0 of the matrix, which is `cos(phi)`.
   - Since the domain is `EXRAW`, `self.domain.to_sympy(cos(phi))` simply returns `cos(phi)`.

5. Therefore, the result of `self._rep.getitem_sympy(0, 0)` is `cos(phi)`.

6. The function returns `cos(phi)` as the final result.
