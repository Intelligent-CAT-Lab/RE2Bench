1. The `_setup` method is called on an instance of `ContinuousBase`. The method starts by creating a copy of itself (`new = copy(self)`).
2. Since `new._tick_params` and `new._label_params` are `None`, the method calls `new.tick()` and `new.label()` to initialize these parameters.
3. The method retrieves the `forward` and `inverse` functions for the transformation (`new._get_transform()`).
4. It then creates a `mpl_scale` object using `new._get_scale()`, passing in the name of the data (`"ymax"`), the `forward` function, and the `inverse` function.
5. A `PseudoAxis` object is created if no axis is provided, and its units are updated using the data.
6. The default locators and formatters for the `mpl_scale` are set based on the axis.
7. The `new._matplotlib_scale` attribute is set to the `mpl_scale` object.
8. Since `prop.normed` is `False` (default), the `normalize` function is set to `None`.
9. The `_pipeline` attribute is created as a list containing the `axis.convert_units`, `forward`, `normalize`, and `prop.get_mapping(new, data)` functions.
10. The `_spacer` function is defined to calculate the minimum difference between unique non-NA values in the data.
11. If `prop.legend` is `True`, the axis view interval is set, and locators and formatters are used to generate legend labels. However, this block is not executed because `prop.legend` is not specified.
12. Finally, the modified `new` object is returned.
