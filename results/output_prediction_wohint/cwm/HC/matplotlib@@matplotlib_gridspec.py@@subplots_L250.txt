This function is creating a single subplot in a 1x1 grid. Since sharex and sharey are both False, no axes are shared. The squeeze parameter is True, so if there is only one subplot, it will be returned as a single Axes object instead of a 2D array. 

The function will check that sharex and sharey are valid values (they are both False, which is valid). It will then create an empty array to hold the axes objects. It will loop through each row and column (only one of each in this case) and create a new axes object using figure.add_subplot. 

Since sharex and sharey are False, the shared_with dictionary will set sharex and sharey to None for the subplot_kw. The axes object will be added to the figure and stored in the axarr array. 

After creating the axes object, the function will check if sharex is 'col' or 'all' (it's not) and if sharey is 'row' or 'all' (it's not), so it will skip those steps. 

Finally, since squeeze is True and there is only one subplot, the function will return the single axes object.
