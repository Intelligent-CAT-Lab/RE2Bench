The `as_content_primitive` function is called with `self = sqrt(2)`, `radical = False`, and `clear = False`. 

First, it checks if `radical` is `True`, which it is not, so it skips the radical extraction logic.

Then, it checks if `self.is_Add` is `True`, which it is not, since `sqrt(2)` is a power expression, not a sum.

Since none of the conditions are met, the function returns `(S.One, self)`, where `S.One` is the identity element for multiplication (i.e., 1) and `self` is the original expression `sqrt(2)`.

Therefore, the output of `as_content_primitive` is `(1, sqrt(2))`.
