I will follow the steps of the execution of the provided code in order to predict the final output.

1. The function `_row_reduce_list` is called with the given arguments. The first step is to initialize some helper functions: `get_col`, `row_swap`, and `cross_cancel`. These functions are used within the main logic of `_row_reduce_list`.

2. The function `_get_intermediate_simp` is called with `_dotprodsimp` as an argument to determine the simplification function `isimp` that will be used later in the code. The exact behavior of `_get_intermediate_simp` depends on the global setting of `dotprodsimp`, but in this case, it returns `_dotprodsimp`.

3. The main loop of the function starts with `piv_row` and `piv_col` both set to 0. The loop continues as long as `piv_col` is less than `cols` (3) and `piv_row` is less than `rows` (3).

4. The function `_find_reasonable_pivot` is called with the current column (starting from column 0) and the `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc` provided. This function attempts to find a suitable pivot in the column. Since the column consists of integer values, it checks if any of these values are non-zero. The first non-zero value it encounters is used as the pivot.

5. Once a pivot is found, the code checks if the pivot is not in the first row (`piv_row == 0`). If it's not, the rows are swapped to bring the pivot to the current row (`piv_row`). The `row_swap` function is used for this purpose, and the swap is recorded in the `swaps` list.

6. If `normalize_last` is `True` and the pivot value is not commutative (which it isn't in this case since it's an integer), the pivot row is normalized. This involves setting the pivot element to 1 and scaling the rest of the row accordingly. However, since `normalize` is `False`, this step is skipped.

7. The code then iterates over all rows to eliminate the pivot column below and above the pivot row. For each row, if the element in the pivot column is not zero, the `cross_cancel` function is used to perform row operations that eliminate this element. The `cross_cancel` function uses the pivot value and the current row's value in the pivot column to compute new values for the current row.

8. After processing all rows for the current pivot, `piv_row` is incremented, and the loop continues with the next column.

9. This process repeats until all columns have been processed or all rows have been used as pivots.

10. Finally, if `normalize_last` and `normalize` are both `True`, the pivot rows are normalized. However, since `normalize` is `False` in this case, this step is skipped.

11. The function returns a tuple containing the modified matrix `mat`, the list of pivot columns `pivot_cols`, and the list of row swaps `swaps`.

Based on the provided input and the steps outlined above, the output of the function `_row_reduce_list` will be the modified matrix along with the pivot columns and row swaps.
