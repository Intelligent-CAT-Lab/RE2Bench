Step 1: The function `_fit_transform` is called with the given input `self` and `K`.

Step 2: The input `K` is passed to the `fit_transform` method of the `_centerer` object, which is an instance of `KernelCenterer`. This method centers the kernel matrix `K`.

Step 3: Since `n_components` is set to 4, the number of components to be extracted is 4.

Step 4: The `eigen_solver` is set to 'arpack', which is used for large sparse matrices or when the number of components is small compared to the number of samples.

Step 5: The `eigsh` function from `scipy.sparse.linalg` is called to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the centered kernel matrix `K`. The `which` parameter is set to 'LA' to compute the largest eigenvalues.

Step 6: The `svd_flip` function is called to ensure that the eigenvectors are consistent with the eigenvalues. This function flips the signs of the eigenvectors if necessary.

Step 7: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of the eigenvalues.

Step 8: Since `remove_zero_eig` is set to False, no eigenvalues or eigenvectors are removed.

Step 9: The centered kernel matrix `K` is returned as the output of the `_fit_transform` method.
