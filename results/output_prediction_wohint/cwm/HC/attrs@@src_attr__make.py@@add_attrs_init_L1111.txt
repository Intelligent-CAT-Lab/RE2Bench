I need to determine the output of the `add_attrs_init` method given the provided input. Let's analyze this step by step.

First, the input is a JSON object containing:
- "self": an object with keys "auto_attribs", "these", and "has_custom_setattr", all set to false, null, and false respectively.
- "args" and "kwargs": both empty objects.

Looking at the `add_attrs_init` method, it seems to generate an initialization script for a class based on its attributes. The method calls `_make_init_script` which in turn calls `_attrs_to_init_script` to create the script, globals, and annotations for the `__init__` method.

However, the input provided doesn't give us enough information about the actual attributes of the class or the class itself. The "self" object in the input seems to be an instance of `_ClassBuilder`, but it lacks crucial details like the class (`_cls`), its attributes (`_attrs`), whether it has a `__pre_init__` or `__post_init__` method, etc.

Given the lack of specific information about the class and its attributes, it's challenging to predict the exact output of `add_attrs_init`. The method's behavior heavily depends on the class's structure and the attributes defined within it.

But based on the structure of the `_ClassBuilder` class and the `add_attrs_init` method, we can infer that it will generate a script that initializes the class's attributes. The script will be added to `self._script_snippets` along with a function `_attach_attrs_init` that attaches the generated `__init__` method to the class.

Since the input doesn't provide enough context about the class and its attributes, the most accurate prediction would be that the method successfully adds the initialization script to `self._script_snippets` and returns the `_ClassBuilder` instance itself, as indicated by the `return self` statement at the end of the `add_attrs_init` method.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "_script_snippets": [
            [
                "def __init__(self, ): pass",
                {},
                "_attach_attrs_init"
            ]
        ]
    }
}
```
