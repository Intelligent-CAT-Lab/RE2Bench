Step 1: The function `replace_unnamed_groups` starts by finding all occurrences of unnamed groups in the given pattern. 
Step 2: The regular expression `unnamed_group_matcher` is used to find all starting indices of unnamed groups in the pattern. 
Step 3: The starting index of an unnamed group is at position 2 (since the pattern starts with '^a', and the first unnamed group starts after 'a/').
Step 4: The code then iterates over each starting index to find the corresponding ending index of the unnamed group. 
Step 5: Since there's only one unnamed group in the pattern "^a/?$", the group starts at index 2 and ends at index 4 (after the '?'). 
Step 6: The group indices list will contain the tuple (2, 4).
Step 7: The code then constructs the `final_pattern` by replacing each unnamed group with '<var>'. 
Step 8: The final pattern will be "^a/<var>$".
Step 9: The function returns the final pattern.
