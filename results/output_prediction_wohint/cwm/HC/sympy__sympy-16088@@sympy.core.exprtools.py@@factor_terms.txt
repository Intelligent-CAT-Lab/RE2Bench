Let's walk through the execution step by step to determine the output of `factor_terms`.

1. **Input Expression**: The input expression is "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)".
   - This is a rational expression where the numerator is `2*x` and the denominator is `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2`.

2. **Sympify**: The first step in `factor_terms` is to convert the input into a SymPy expression using `sympify`.
   - `sympify("2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)")` parses the string into a SymPy expression.
   - The resulting expression is `2*x / (a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`.

3. **Content-Primitive Split**: The expression is split into content and primitive parts using `as_content_primitive`.
   - The content is the numerical coefficient, which is `2`.
   - The primitive part is the remaining expression: `x / (a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`.

4. **Denominator Factoring**: The denominator `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2` can be factored.
   - Factor out `a**2` from both terms: `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`.
   - Further factor `x**2 - y**2` as a difference of squares: `(x - y)*(x + y)`.
   - So the denominator becomes `a**2*(x - y)*(x + y)`.

5. **Simplified Expression**: Substitute the factored denominator back into the original expression.
   - The expression becomes `2*x / (a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`.

6. **Final Output**: The fully factored form of the input expression is `2*x / (a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`.
