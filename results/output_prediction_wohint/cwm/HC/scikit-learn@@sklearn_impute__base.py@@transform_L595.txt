Step 1: The `transform` function is called with the input data array. The first step is to perform a `check_is_fitted` validation to ensure that the imputer has been fitted before transforming the data.

Step 2: The `X` variable is validated using `_validate_input` function with `in_fit=False`. This checks for the data type of `X`, missing values, and ensures compatibility between the input data and the imputer's configuration. Since the strategy is 'mean' and the data is numeric, it proceeds with the validation.

Step 3: The `statistics_` attribute of the imputer, which holds the mean values for each feature (calculated during the `fit` method), is retrieved and assigned to the `statistics` variable.

Step 4: The code checks if the number of features in `X` matches the number of features in the `statistics_`. If they do not match, a `ValueError` is raised.

Step 5: The missing mask is generated using `_get_mask` function, which identifies the positions of missing values (`NaN`) in the input data `X`. This mask will be used to determine where imputation is needed.

Step 6: Since `keep_empty_features` is `False`, the code checks for any features without observed values in the `statistics_` array. Any features without observed values are skipped, and a warning is issued.

Step 7: Since `add_indicator` is `False`, the `_transform_indicator` function is not called, and `X_indicator` is set to `None`.

Step 8: The missing values in `X` are replaced using the mean values from `statistics_`. This involves calculating the number of missing values for each feature, repeating the mean values accordingly, and assigning them to the corresponding positions in `X` where missing values are present.

Step 9: Finally, the imputed data is returned. Since `add_indicator` is `False`, the output is just the imputed data without any additional indicator columns.
