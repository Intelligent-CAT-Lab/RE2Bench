1. `self._ignore` is True, so the code will set `points` to `[[inf, inf], [-inf, -inf]]` and `minpos` to `[inf, inf]`.
2. `path.vertices` is an array of three points, all being `[1., 1.]`. Therefore, `valid_points` will be an array of three `True` values since all coordinates are finite.
3. Since `updatex` and `updatey` are both True, the code will update both x and y coordinates of `points` and `minpos`.
4. For the x-coordinate:
   - `x` will be an array of three 1.0 values.
   - `points[0, 0]` will be updated to `min(inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
   - `points[1, 0]` will be updated to `max(-inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
   - `minpos[0]` will be updated to `min(inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
5. For the y-coordinate:
   - `y` will be an array of three 1.0 values.
   - `points[0, 1]` will be updated to `min(inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
   - `points[1, 1]` will be updated to `max(-inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
   - `minpos[1]` will be updated to `min(inf, 1.0)` which is 1.0.
6. Since `points` and `minpos` have changed, the code will call `self.invalidate()` and update `self._points` and `self._minpos` with the new values.
