1. `self._scorers` is a dictionary with one scorer, "score": "EmpiricalCovariance.score". Since there's only one scorer, `_use_cache` returns False.
2. Since routing is not enabled (as per `_routing_enabled`), `routed_params` is constructed using a dictionary comprehension. It creates a Bunch for each scorer with empty score parameters.
3. The loop iterates over the single scorer "score". Since the scorer is not an instance of `_BaseScorer`, it directly calls the scorer function "EmpiricalCovariance.score" with the provided arguments.
4. The `EmpiricalCovariance.score` function is called with the estimator "EmpiricalCovariance()" and the argument "array([[ 0.88895051, -0.94884286, -0.77838201, -0.99349011, -0.74907652]])".
5. The score is computed and stored in the `scores` dictionary under the key "score".
