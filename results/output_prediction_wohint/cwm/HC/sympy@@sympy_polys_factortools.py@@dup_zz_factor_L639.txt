Let's analyze the execution of the `dup_zz_factor` function step-by-step with the given input.

Input:
- `f = [1]` (a polynomial with a single term, the coefficient 1)
- `K = ZZ` (the domain is the integers)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check `GROUND_TYPES`**: 
   - The code checks if `GROUND_TYPES == 'flint'`. Since the input doesn't specify this, we assume it's not the case, so this block is skipped.

2. **Compute content and primitive form**:
   - `cont, g = dup_primitive(f, K)` is called.
   - `dup_primitive` returns `(1, [1])` because the content (greatest common divisor of coefficients) is 1, and the primitive form is the polynomial itself since it's already primitive.

3. **Get degree of `g`**:
   - `n = dup_degree(g)` is called.
   - `dup_degree([1])` returns 0 because the degree of a polynomial with a single term (non-zero constant) is 0.

4. **Check if degree is ≤ 0**:
   - Since `n = 0`, the condition `if n <= 0` is true.
   - The function returns `(cont, [])`, which is `(1, [])`.

The output is `(1, [])`, indicating that the content is 1 and there are no factors (since the polynomial is a constant).
