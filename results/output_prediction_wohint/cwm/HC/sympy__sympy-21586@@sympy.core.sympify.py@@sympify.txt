Step 1: The function `sympify` is called with the argument `a="2500/pi"` and the keyword argument `strict=True`. 
Step 2: `sympify` first checks if `a` has the attribute `__sympy__`, which is not the case for a string.
Step 3: It then checks if `a` is an instance of `CantSympify`, which it isn't.
Step 4: The function retrieves the class of `a`, which is `str`.
Step 5: It checks if there's a converter for the class `str` in the `converter` dictionary, but there isn't one.
Step 6: Since `a` is a string, it skips checking for numpy instances.
Step 7: It also skips checking for the `_sympy_` attribute.
Step 8: Since `strict` is `True`, it skips trying to convert `a` to a numpy array or other types.
Step 9: It checks if `a` is iterable, which it isn't, so it skips that step.
Step 10: Since `a` is a string and `strict` is `True`, it proceeds to parse the string using `parse_expr` from `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser`.
Step 11: The `parse_expr` function is called with `a="2500/pi"`, `local_dict=None`, `transformations=standard_transformations`, and `evaluate=None`.
Step 12: The `parse_expr` function parses the string "2500/pi" into a SymPy expression, which is `2500/pi`.
Step 13: The parsed expression is returned as the result of `sympify`.
