Step 1: The method `_get_empty_routing` is called, which initializes an empty Bunch object to store routing information for each transformer.

Step 2: It then enters a loop over the `self._iter` generator, passing `fitted=False`, `column_as_labels=False`, `skip_drop=True`, and `skip_empty_columns=True`. This means it will iterate over the transformers, skipping any 'drop' transformers and empty column selections.

Step 3: In the loop, for each transformer `(name, step, _, _)`, it creates a Bunch object with keys corresponding to the methods in `METHODS` (from `sklearn.utils._metadata_requests`), each mapped to an empty dictionary.

Step 4: The loop processes the first (and only) transformer in `self.transformers`, which is `('trans', 'Trans()', <function ...>)`. Since `skip_drop=True` and `skip_empty_columns=True`, and assuming the column selection is not empty, this transformer is included.

Step 5: The Bunch object for 'trans' is created with all methods mapped to empty dictionaries.

Step 6: The loop then checks `self._remainder`, which is `('remainder', 'drop', [1])`. Since `skip_drop=True`, this 'drop' transformer is skipped and not included in the routing.

Step 7: The final Bunch object is returned, containing the routing information for the 'trans' transformer.
