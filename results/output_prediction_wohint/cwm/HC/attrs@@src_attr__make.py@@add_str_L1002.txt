We're given the `add_str` method of the `_ClassBuilder` class in the context of the attrs library for Python. The task is to determine what happens when `add_str` is called given the provided input.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The input indicates that `self` is an instance of `_ClassBuilder` for a class named `Error`. This suggests that the class being built is likely a custom exception class.

2. **Checking `_repr_added`**:
   - Inside `add_str`, the first thing it checks is if `_repr_added` is `False`. The `_repr_added` attribute is a flag indicating whether a `__repr__` method has been added to the class being built.
   - Since the provided input does not mention any prior addition of a `__repr__` method, we can infer that `_repr_added` is likely `False`.

3. **Raising an Error**:
   - If `_repr_added` is `False`, the method raises a `ValueError` with the message `'__str__ can only be generated if a __repr__ exists.'`. This is because the attrs library requires a `__repr__` method to be defined before generating a `__str__` method, as `__str__` is often implemented to return the same value as `__repr__` or a more human-readable version of it.

Given this analysis, when `add_str` is called on the provided `_ClassBuilder` instance, it will raise a `ValueError` because no `__repr__` method has been added yet.
