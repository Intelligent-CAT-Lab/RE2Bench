The input parameters for the `transform` function are `X=null` and `self` with some attributes. I need to understand how the `transform` function handles this case. 

First, I'll look into the `transform` function. It starts by calling `_get_output_config` to determine the output configuration. Then it checks if `X` has the `iloc` attribute (common in pandas DataFrames) and if the output configuration is 'pandas'. Since `X` is null, it likely will not have the `iloc` attribute, so `preserve_X` will be False. 

Next, it calls `self._validate_data` to validate the input data. Given that `X` is null, this might raise an error or return an empty array, depending on how the validation is implemented. However, since the exact implementation of `_validate_data` isn't provided, I'll assume it can handle null inputs gracefully or that the function is designed to work with such cases, possibly returning an empty array or a default value.

After validation, it calls `self._transform(X)`. This function uses `self.get_support()` to get a mask of features to keep. If no features are selected (i.e., the mask is all False), it issues a warning and returns an empty array. Otherwise, it uses `_safe_indexing` to select the features from `X` based on the mask.

Given that `self.scores_` is "[0 0 1]" and `self.pvalues_` is "[0 0 1]", it suggests that only the third feature (index 2) is selected. Therefore, the mask returned by `self.get_support()` should be [False, False, True].

If `X` is null or empty, the output of `_safe_indexing` would likely be an empty array with the same number of rows as `X` (which is 0 if `X` is null) and 1 column (for the selected feature).

So, the final output should be an empty array with shape (0, 1).
