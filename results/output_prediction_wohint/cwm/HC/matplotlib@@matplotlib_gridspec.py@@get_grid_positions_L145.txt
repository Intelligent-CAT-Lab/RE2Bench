Step 1: The function `get_grid_positions` is called with a `GridSpecBase` instance (as `self`) and a figure object (`fig`).
Step 2: `nrows, ncols = self.get_geometry()` is executed. The `get_geometry` method returns the tuple `(1, 1)`, since `self._nrows` and `self._ncols` are both 1.
Step 3: The `get_subplot_params` method is called with the figure object. This method returns a `SubplotParams` object, which is stored in `subplot_params`.
Step 4: The `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top` attributes are accessed from `subplot_params`. These represent the boundaries of the figure's subplot area.
Step 5: The `wspace` and `hspace` attributes are accessed from `subplot_params`, representing the horizontal and vertical spacing between subplots.
Step 6: The total width (`tot_width`) and height (`tot_height`) of the subplot area are calculated by subtracting the left from the right and bottom from top, respectively.
Step 7: The height of each cell (`cell_h`) is calculated by dividing the total height by the number of rows plus the product of vertical spacing and (number of rows minus 1).
Step 8: The height of the vertical separators (`sep_h`) is calculated by multiplying the vertical spacing by the cell height.
Step 9: A normalization factor (`norm`) is calculated for the row heights by multiplying the cell height by the number of rows and dividing by the sum of the row height ratios.
Step 10: The actual heights of each row (`cell_heights`) are calculated by multiplying each row height ratio by the normalization factor.
Step 11: The vertical separator heights (`sep_heights`) are created by combining a leading 0 with the vertical separator height repeated (number of rows minus 1) times.
Step 12: The cumulative sum of the combined separator and cell heights (`cell_hs`) is calculated using NumPy, resulting in an array representing the positions of the bottom edges of the rows.
Step 13: The width of each cell (`cell_w`) is calculated similarly to the cell height, using the total width, number of columns, and horizontal spacing.
Step 14: The width of the horizontal separators (`sep_w`) is calculated by multiplying the horizontal spacing by the cell width.
Step 15: A normalization factor (`norm`) is calculated for the column widths by multiplying the cell width by the number of columns and dividing by the sum of the column width ratios.
Step 16: The actual widths of each column (`cell_widths`) are calculated by multiplying each column width ratio by the normalization factor.
Step 17: The horizontal separator widths (`sep_widths`) are created by combining a leading 0 with the horizontal separator width repeated (number of columns minus 1) times.
Step 18: The cumulative sum of the combined separator and cell widths (`cell_ws`) is calculated using NumPy, resulting in an array representing the positions of the left edges of the columns.
Step 19: The top and bottom edges of the figure are calculated by subtracting the cumulative heights from the top of the figure and reshaping the result into two arrays.
Step 20: The left and right edges of the figure are calculated by adding the cumulative widths to the left of the figure and reshaping the result into two arrays.
Step 21: The function returns a tuple containing the bottom edges, top edges, left edges, and right edges of the grid positions.
