Let's break down the execution of `euclidean_distances` with the given input.

1. **Input Arrays**: The input arrays `X` and `Y` are both 2D arrays with shape `(1, 4)`. `X` is `[[0.56804456, 0.92559664, 0.07103606, 0.0871293]]` and `Y` is `[[0.96366276, 0.38344152, 0.79172504, 0.52889492]]`.

2. **Check Pairwise Arrays**: The function `check_pairwise_arrays` is called to ensure `X` and `Y` are valid for pairwise distance calculation. Since both arrays have the same number of features (4), they are compatible.

3. **Calculate Norms**: The function calculates the squared Euclidean norms of the rows in `X` and `Y`. For `X`, the norm is calculated as:
   ```
   XX = (0.56804456^2 + 0.92559664^2 + 0.07103606^2 + 0.0871293^2) = 1.0 (approximately)
   ```
   Similarly, for `Y`, the norm is:
   ```
   YY = (0.96366276^2 + 0.38344152^2 + 0.79172504^2 + 0.52889492^2) = 1.9 (approximately)
   ```

4. **Compute Distances**: The Euclidean distance between `X` and `Y` is computed using the formula:
   ```
   distance^2 = XX + YY - 2 * dot(X, Y^T)
   ```
   where `dot(X, Y^T)` is the dot product of `X` and the transpose of `Y`.

   Let's calculate the dot product:
   ```
   dot(X, Y^T) = (0.56804456 * 0.96366276) + (0.92559664 * 0.38344152) + (0.07103606 * 0.79172504) + (0.0871293 * 0.52889492)
   ≈ 0.547 + 0.355 + 0.056 + 0.046 = 1.004
   ```

   Now, compute the squared distance:
   ```
   distance^2 = 1.0 + 1.9 - 2 * 1.004 ≈ 3.9 - 2.008 = 1.892
   ```

5. **Return Result**: Since `squared=True`, the function returns the squared distance directly without taking the square root.

Therefore, the output of the function will be a 2D array containing the squared Euclidean distance between the two input arrays.
