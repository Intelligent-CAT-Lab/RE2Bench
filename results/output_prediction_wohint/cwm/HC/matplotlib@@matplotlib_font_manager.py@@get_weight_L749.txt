The provided input represents an instance of the `FontProperties` class. The task is to predict the output of calling the `get_weight` method on this instance.

1. The instance has an attribute `_weight` set to `"normal"`.
2. The `get_weight` method simply returns the value of `_weight`.

Since `_weight` is already set to `"normal"`, the `get_weight` method will return this value directly without any modifications.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "return_value": "normal"
}
```
