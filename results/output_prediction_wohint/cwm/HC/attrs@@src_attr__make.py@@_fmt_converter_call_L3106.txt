I am now stepping through the execution of the `_fmt_converter_call` method in the `Converter` class.

The method is called with the arguments:
- `attr_name`: "a"
- `value_var`: "a"

The first step is to check if the converter takes either `self` or `field`. In this case, since `takes_self` and `takes_field` are both `False`, the method returns the result of `f'{self._get_global_name(attr_name)}({value_var})'`.

This calls the `_get_global_name` static method, which takes `attr_name` ("a") and returns the formatted string `"__attr_converter_a"`.

Then, the method constructs and returns the string `"__attr_converter_a(a)"`.

[OUTPUT]
"__attr_converter_a(a)"
