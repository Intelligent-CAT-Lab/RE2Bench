Let's step through the execution of the `restify` function with the given input.

1. The function is called with `cls=None`. 
2. Inside the function, the first condition checks if `cls is None or cls is NoneType`. Since `cls` is indeed `None`, this condition is true.
3. Therefore, the function returns `':py:obj:`None`'`.
