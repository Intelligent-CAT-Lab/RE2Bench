I need to determine the output of the `add_order` method given the input. Let me start by understanding the code structure.

The `add_order` method is part of the `_ClassBuilder` class. It modifies `self._cls_dict` by adding comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`). These methods are generated by calling `_make_order(self._cls, self._attrs)`, which returns four comparison functions.

However, the input provided seems incomplete or unrelated to the `add_order` method's parameters. The input mentions attributes like `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr`, but these are part of the `_ClassBuilder`'s `__init__` method, not `add_order`.

Since `add_order` doesn't take any arguments and relies on the instance's state (specifically `self._cls` and `self._attrs`), the output depends on those attributes. But without knowing the specific values of `self._cls` and `self._attrs`, it's challenging to predict the exact output.

Assuming that `_make_order` correctly generates the comparison methods and `_add_method_dunders` properly sets their module, qualname, and docstring, the `add_order` method should successfully add these methods to `self._cls_dict`.

However, given the lack of specific information about `self._cls` and `self._attrs`, the best I can conclude is that `add_order` will return the `_ClassBuilder` instance itself, as indicated by the `return self` statement at the end of the method.
