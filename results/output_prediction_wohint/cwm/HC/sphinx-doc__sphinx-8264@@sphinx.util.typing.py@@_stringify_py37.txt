<think>
1. The function `_stringify_py37` is called with an `annotation` object.
2. The `module` is retrieved from the `annotation` object using `getattr(annotation, '__module__', None)`. In this case, `module` is set to `'test_util_typing'`.
3. The function checks if `module` is equal to `'typing'`. Since it's not, the function moves to the next condition.
4. The function checks if the `annotation` object has a `__qualname__` attribute using `hasattr(annotation, '__qualname__')`. Since the `annotation` object does not have this attribute, the function moves to the next condition.
5. The function checks if the `annotation` object has an `__origin__` attribute using `hasattr(annotation, '__origin__')`. Since the `annotation` object does not have this attribute, the function moves to the next condition.
6. The function returns `repr(annotation)` because none of the previous conditions were met.
