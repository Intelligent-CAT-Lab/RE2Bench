1. `params` is processed, filtering out any None values to obtain `args`, which is `{ "sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a" }`.
2. It checks `_requests` against the keys in `args`.
3. Since `"sample_weight"` is requested (value `True` in `_requests`), it is included in the result, with `res["sample_weight"] = [1]`.
4. Similarly, `"metadata"` is requested (`True` in `_requests`), so it is added to the result with `res["metadata"] = "a"`.
5. The `_requests` don't contain `False`, `None`, or the `WARN` flag, so no unrequested parameters are detected.
6. `Bunch` object `res` is returned with keys `"sample_weight"` and `"metadata"` and their respective values.
