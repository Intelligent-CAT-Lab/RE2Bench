The function `fit_predict` is called on an instance of the `DBSCAN` class. Here's the step-by-step execution:

1. The `fit_predict` method calls the `fit` method, passing `X` and `sample_weight` to it.
2. Inside the `fit` method, the input data `X` is validated using `validate_data`. Since `X` is a NumPy array, it is accepted as is.
3. The `sample_weight` is checked and validated using `_check_sample_weight`.
4. The metric is not 'precomputed', so the code proceeds to create a `NearestNeighbors` model with the specified parameters (`radius=self.eps`, `algorithm=self.algorithm`, etc.).
5. The `NearestNeighbors` model is fitted to the data `X`.
6. The `radius_neighbors` method is called on the fitted model to find the neighborhoods within the specified radius (`self.eps`).
7. Since `sample_weight` is provided, the number of neighbors for each sample is calculated using the sample weights.
8. An array `labels` is initialized with -1 for all samples, indicating that no clusters have been assigned yet.
9. An array `core_samples` is created to identify core samples based on the condition `n_neighbors >= self.min_samples`.
10. The `dbscan_inner` function is called to perform the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, updating the `labels` array with cluster assignments.
11. The `core_sample_indices_` attribute is set to the indices of core samples.
12. The `labels_` attribute is set to the cluster labels.
13. If there are core samples, the `components_` attribute is set to the data points corresponding to core samples; otherwise, it is an empty array.
14. The `fit` method returns the instance of the `DBSCAN` class.
15. The `fit_predict` method returns the `labels_` attribute, which contains the cluster labels for each sample in `X`.

The output will be an array of cluster labels for the input data `X`.
