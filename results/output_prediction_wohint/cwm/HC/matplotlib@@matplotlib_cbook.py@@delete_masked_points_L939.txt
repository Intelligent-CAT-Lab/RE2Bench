1. The function `delete_masked_points` is called with a single argument which is a list containing three elements: two numpy arrays and `None`. 
2. Since there is one argument, it does not raise an error. 
3. The first argument is checked to see if it's a scalar or string using the `is_scalar_or_string` function. Since it's a list, it's not a scalar or string, so the function proceeds.
4. The length of the first argument (nrecs) is 3, which is the number of elements in the list.
5. The code then iterates over each element in the arguments. 
   a. For the first element (a string representing a numpy array), it checks if it's not a string, iterable, and has the same length as nrecs. Since it's a string, the condition fails, and it's added to margs as is.
   b. The same logic applies to the second element (another string representing a numpy array). It's also added to margs as is.
   c. For the third element (None), the condition fails because None is not iterable, so it's added to margs as is.
6. After processing all arguments, the code checks for masks. Since none of the elements in margs are sequences (they are all strings or None), no masks are created.
7. Since there are no masks, the code skips the part where it would filter out masked points.
8. Finally, the function returns margs, which contains the original arguments: two strings and None.
