Let's walk through how _eval_is_zero is executed for the input "pi/2". 

First, the function _eval_is_zero calls the helper method _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper, which iterates over the arguments of the expression (in this case, the arguments of the multiplication operation). For each argument, it checks if it is zero or infinite.

The input is "pi/2", which represents the mathematical constant pi divided by 2. Since pi is an irrational number, it is not zero and not infinite. Therefore, for the argument "pi/2", both is_zero and is_infinite will return False.

During the iteration in _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper:
- seen_zero and seen_infinite are initialized to False.
- The argument "pi/2" is processed. Since neither is_zero nor is_infinite is True, the code checks if is_zero or is_infinite could be None. However, since "pi/2" is a known constant, its is_zero and is_infinite attributes are definitely False. Therefore, seen_zero remains False, and seen_infinite remains False.

After processing all arguments, _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper returns (False, False).

Back in _eval_is_zero, the returned values are:
- seen_zero = False
- seen_infinite = False

The function then evaluates:
- Since seen_zero is False, it returns False immediately, without considering seen_infinite.

Therefore, the result of _eval_is_zero for the input "pi/2" is False.
