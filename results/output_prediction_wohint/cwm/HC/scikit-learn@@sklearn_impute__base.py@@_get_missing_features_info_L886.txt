Okay, let's see. I need to predict the output of `_get_missing_features_info` given the input provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the input includes a `self` object with various attributes: `missing_values` is NaN, `features` is 'missing-only', `sparse` is 'auto', `error_on_new` is False, `_precomputed` is True, and `n_features_in_` and `_n_features` are both 2. The `args` has an `X` which is a 2D array (probably a numpy array) with shape (10, 2). Each row alternates between [True, True] and [False, False].

The function `_get_missing_features_info` starts by checking if `_precomputed` is False. Since in this case, `_precomputed` is True, it sets `imputer_mask` to `X` directly. So `imputer_mask` is the same as the input array X.

Next, it checks if `X` is sparse. The input X is a dense array (as seen from the array structure), so the code skips the sparse handling part. Therefore, it proceeds to the else block.

In the else block, since `_precomputed` is True, `imputer_mask` is already set to X. The code then checks if `features` is 'missing-only'. Since it is, it calculates `n_missing` by summing `imputer_mask` along axis 0 (columns). 

Looking at the input X, each column has 5 True values (since there are 10 rows, alternating True/False). So `n_missing` for each column would be 5. But wait, actually, the sum of a boolean array in numpy treats True as 1 and False as 0. So summing along axis 0 would give [5, 5], because each column has 5 True entries.

Then, since `features` is 'missing-only', `features_indices` is set to the indices where `n_missing` is non-zero. Since both columns have 5 (non-zero), `features_indices` would be [0, 1].

Finally, the function returns a tuple `(imputer_mask, features_indices)`. The `imputer_mask` is the original X array, and `features_indices` is [0, 1].

But wait, let me double-check. The input X is a boolean array where each row alternates between all True and all False. So for each column, there are 5 True and 5 False. Therefore, the sum along axis 0 (columns) would indeed be 5 for both columns. Hence, `features_indices` includes both columns.

Therefore, the output should be the original X array and the array [0, 1].
