Step 1: The function _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper begins execution with self set to "-pi/4". The goal of this function is to determine if any of the arguments of self are zero or infinite, and to handle cases where a mix of zero and infinite values are present.

Step 2: Initialize the variables seen_zero and seen_infinite to False. These variables will track whether a zero or infinite value has been encountered, respectively.

Step 3: Iterate over each argument in self.args. In this case, self.args is ("pi",).

Step 4: For the first argument, a, which is "pi":
- Check if a.is_zero is True. Since "pi" is not zero, this condition is False.
- Check if a.is_infinite is True. Since "pi" is not infinite, this condition is False.
- Check if seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None. Since seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None (indicating uncertainty), set seen_zero to None.
- Check if seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None. Since seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None, set seen_infinite to None.

Step 5: After processing all arguments, return the tuple (seen_zero, seen_infinite), which is (None, None). This result indicates that there is uncertainty regarding both zero and infinite properties among the arguments.
