The `aliased_name` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the string followed by any aliases for it, if they exist. 

1. The function first checks if there are any aliases for the given string `s` by looking up `s` in the `aliasd` dictionary.
2. If aliases are found, they are sorted and joined into a string with " or " in between each alias.
3. The resulting string of aliases is then appended to the original string `s` to form the final output.

In this case, the input string is "clip_on" and the `aliasd` dictionary is empty. Therefore, there are no aliases for "clip_on", and the function will simply return "clip_on".
