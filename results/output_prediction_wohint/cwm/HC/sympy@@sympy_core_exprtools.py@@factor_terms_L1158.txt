Step 1: `factor_terms` is called with the expression `"sin(phi)"`. 
Step 2: `sympify` is called to convert the expression to a SymPy type. Since `"sin(phi)"` is a string, `parse_expr` will convert it into a SymPy expression.
Step 3: The `do` function is called on the SymPy expression of `"sin(phi)"`.
Step 4: Since `sin(phi)` is not a Basic type or an atom, the code checks if it is a power, function, iterable, or does not have `args_cnc`. In this case, it is a function.
Step 5: The function will have its arguments converted recursively (though there are no arguments here).
Step 6: After the function arguments are processed, the original function is returned with the processed arguments (which is unchanged in this case).
Step 7: No further processing is needed since it's a function with no arguments that can be factored or simplified.
