Step-by-step analysis of the code execution:

1. The function `_read` is called on an instance of the `Dvi` class with an open file and an initial state of `_dvistate.outer`.
2. The variable `down_stack` is initialized as `[0]` to keep track of the nesting level of certain operations.
3. The function enters a `while True` loop, where it reads the next byte from the file and processes it according to the `_dtable[byte](self, byte)` dispatch.
4. Initially, the state is `_dvistate.outer`. The code checks the current state and ensures it matches the expected state for the operation being performed.
5. The `_push` operation is identified (as the dispatched method's name is `_push`), and the `down_stack` is updated by appending a copy of the last element. This suggests that the current operation involves pushing a new level onto a stack.
6. The loop continues, reading and processing bytes until it encounters a byte with the value `140`. At this point, the function returns `True`, indicating that the reading operation was successful.
7. Throughout the process, the function does not encounter any missing fonts or state precondition failures, so it does not raise any exceptions.
8. The function returns `True` as the final result, indicating that the reading operation was completed successfully.
