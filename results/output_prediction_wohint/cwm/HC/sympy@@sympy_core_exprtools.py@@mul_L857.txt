I need to predict the output of the `mul` method of the `Term` class given the specific input. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the input. The `self` parameter is a `Term` object initialized with `coeff=1`, `numer=Factors({})`, and `denom=Factors({})`. The `other` parameter is another `Term` object with the same values: `coeff=1`, `numer=Factors({})`, and `denom=Factors({})`.

The `mul` method multiplies two `Term` objects. Let's see how it works:

1. It starts by calculating the new coefficient as the product of the coefficients of `self` and `other`. In this case, `1 * 1 = 1`.
2. Then it multiplies the numerators of `self` and `other`. Since both are empty `Factors`, the result is still an empty `Factors`.
3. Similarly, it multiplies the denominators. Again, both are empty, so the result remains an empty `Factors`.
4. The method then calls `numer.normal(denom)` to simplify the resulting numerator and denominator by removing any common factors. Since both are empty, this step doesn't change anything.
5. Finally, it returns a new `Term` object with the calculated coefficient, numerator, and denominator.

Putting this all together, the resulting `Term` object should have `coeff=1`, `numer=Factors({})`, and `denom=Factors({})`, which is the same as the input terms.

{
    "coeff": 1,
    "numer": "Factors({})",
    "denom": "Factors({})"
}
