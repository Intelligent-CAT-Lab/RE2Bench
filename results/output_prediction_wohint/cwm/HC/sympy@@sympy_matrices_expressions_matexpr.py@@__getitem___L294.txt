Step 1: The function `__getitem__` is called with `key` being a tuple `(1, 2)`. The code checks if `key` is a tuple and has exactly two elements, which is true in this case.

Step 2: It then checks if either `i` or `j` (the elements of the tuple) are slices. Since `1` and `2` are integers, this condition is not met.

Step 3: The code converts `i` and `j` to SymPy objects using `_sympify`. This step is crucial because it ensures that the indices are in a format that can be used with SymPy's matrix operations.

Step 4: The function `valid_index` is called to check if the indices are valid for the matrix. This function checks if `i` and `j` are of valid types (int, Integer, Symbol, Expr) and if they are within the bounds of the matrix's rows and columns.

Step 5: If the indices are valid, the function calls `self._entry(i, j)` to retrieve the element at the specified position. The `_entry` method is responsible for actually fetching the element from the matrix.

Step 6: The result of `self._entry(i, j)` is returned as the output of `__getitem__`.
