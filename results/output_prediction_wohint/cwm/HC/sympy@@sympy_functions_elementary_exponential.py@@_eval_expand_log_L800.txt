<think>
In the log._eval_expand_log function, the input has 2 arguments, which matches the condition `if len(self.args) == 2:`. This causes the function to return `expand_log(self.func(*self.args), deep=deep, force=force)`. Given that `deep=True`, `force=False`, and the arguments of the log function are `{1, 2}`, the function will call `expand_log(log(1, 2), deep=True, force=False)`. Since the `log` function with two arguments is handled by `expand_log`, which does not change the arguments when `force=False`, the result will be the same as the original log expression with arguments 1 and 2.
