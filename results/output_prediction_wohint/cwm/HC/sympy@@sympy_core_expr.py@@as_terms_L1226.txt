Step 1: Start by calling `as_terms` method on the expression "-w**2 - x**2 + y**2 + z**2".
Step 2: Inside `as_terms`, iterate over each term in the expression using `Add.make_args(self)`.
Step 3: For each term, extract the coefficient and the remaining expression using `as_coeff_Mul` method.
Step 4: Convert the coefficient to a complex number.
Step 5: Initialize two empty lists, `cpart` and `ncpart`, to store the commutative and non-commutative parts of the term respectively.
Step 6: If the remaining expression is not equal to 1, iterate over each factor in the remaining expression using `Mul.make_args`.
Step 7: For each factor, check if it is a number. If it is, try to convert it to a complex number and multiply it with the coefficient. If it is not a number, check if it is commutative.
Step 8: If the factor is commutative, decompose it into a base and an exponent using `decompose_power`. Add the base and exponent to `cpart` and add the base to `gens_set`.
Step 9: If the factor is not commutative, add it to `ncpart`.
Step 10: Convert the coefficient to a tuple of real and imaginary parts.
Step 11: Convert `ncpart` to a tuple.
Step 12: Append the term, coefficient tuple, `cpart`, and `ncpart` tuple to the `terms` list.
Step 13: Sort `gens_set` using `default_sort_key` and create a dictionary `indices` to map each generator to its index.
Step 14: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the final terms.
Step 15: Iterate over each term in `terms` and create a monomial tuple based on the exponents in `cpart`.
Step 16: Append the term, coefficient tuple, monomial tuple, and `ncpart` tuple to the `result` list.
Step 17: Return the `result` list and the sorted list of generators.
