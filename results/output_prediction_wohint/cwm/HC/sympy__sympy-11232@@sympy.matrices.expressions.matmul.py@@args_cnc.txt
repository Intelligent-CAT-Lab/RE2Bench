Since the `self` argument is an empty dictionary and does not represent a `Mul` object, the function will not proceed to separate commutative and non-commutative arguments. The function will simply return the original arguments as the commutative part and an empty list as the non-commutative part. However, since `cset` is `true`, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no commutative arguments to convert to a set.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "exception": "ValueError"
