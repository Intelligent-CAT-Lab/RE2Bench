Okay, let's break down how the `split_super_sub` function works with the input "Fvec". 

The function starts by checking if the input text is empty. Since "Fvec" is not empty, it proceeds. It initializes variables: `name` is `None`, and `supers` and `subs` are empty lists. 

It then enters a while loop that processes the text character by character. The loop starts at position 0. 

At position 0, the code checks for double underscores (`__`), but since "Fvec" doesn't start with that, it moves on. It looks for the next caret (`^`) or underscore (`_`) starting from position 1. Since neither is found in "Fvec", `pos_next` becomes the length of the string (4). 

The part from position 0 to 4 is "Fvec", which is assigned to `name` because `name` was initially `None`. Now, `name` is "Fvec", and `pos` is updated to 4, which is the end of the string. The loop exits.

Next, the code uses a regular expression (`_name_with_digits_p`) to check if `name` matches a pattern of letters followed by digits. The pattern is `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`, but "Fvec" doesn't match this because it has no digits. So, the regex match returns `None`.

Since the regex didn't match, the code skips the part where it would insert a digit substring into `subs`. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `name`, `supers`, and `subs`. 

So, the output is ("Fvec", [], []).
