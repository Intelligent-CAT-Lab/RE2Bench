[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `__pow__` with the given inputs:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self`: A Permutation instance with `_size = 7`, `_array_form = null`, `_cyclic_form = null`
   - `n = -2` (base 10 integer)

2. First check: `if isinstance(n, Permutation):`
   - n = -2 is an integer, not a Permutation
   - This condition is False, so we continue

3. Convert n to int: `n = int(n)`
   - Since n is already -2, and the provided "Functions called during execution" includes `Integer.__int__`, this suggests n might be a sympy Integer object
   - If n is `Integer(-2)`, then `int(n)` calls the `Integer.__int__()` method which returns `self.p = -2`
   - n is now -2 (a Python int)

4. Return statement: `return self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`
   - This needs to access `self.array_form` property (not `_array_form` attribute)
   - Since `_array_form = null` (None), the property likely computes it from available data
   - With `_size = 7` and no other form specified, this represents an identity permutation of size 7
   - The identity permutation's array form is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   - `_af_pow([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], -2)` computes the identity raised to power -2
   - Since identity raised to any power is still identity, this returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   - `_af_new([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` wraps this into a new Permutation object

5. The resulting Permutation is the identity permutation of size 7 with array form [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and empty cycle form (since all elements are fixed points)
