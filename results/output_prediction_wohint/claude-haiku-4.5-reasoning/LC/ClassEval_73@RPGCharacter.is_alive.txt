[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `is_alive` method.

The input provides self with:
- name: "John"
- hp: 100
- attack_power: 20
- defense: 10
- level: 1
- exp: 0

And no args or kwargs are provided.

The `is_alive` method executes:
```python
def is_alive(self):
    return self.hp > 0
```

This returns `self.hp > 0`, which evaluates to `100 > 0`, which is `True`.
