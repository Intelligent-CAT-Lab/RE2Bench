[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this step by step.

We have a BookManagement instance with:
- self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}

We're calling add_book with:
- title = "book2"
- quantity = 1 (default parameter value)

Now let's execute the method:

1. Check if title ("book2") is in self.inventory
   - Yes, "book2" is in the dictionary
   
2. Since "book2" exists in inventory, execute the if branch:
   - self.inventory[title] += quantity
   - self.inventory["book2"] += 1
   - self.inventory["book2"] becomes 1 + 1 = 2

After execution:
- self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 2}

The add_book method does not have an explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns None.
