[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution:

1. We have a `CamelCaseMap` instance with `self._data = {}` (an empty dictionary)
2. The `__len__` method is called
3. `__len__` returns `len(self._data)`
4. Since `self._data` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `len({})` equals `0`
5. Therefore, the method returns `0`
