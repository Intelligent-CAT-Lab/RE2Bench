[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Input: "1 1"

1. `x = list(input().split())`
   - `input()` returns the string "1 1"
   - `.split()` splits by whitespace, giving ["1", "1"]
   - `list()` gives us x = ["1", "1"]

2. Convert each element to integer:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(x)):  # i from 0 to 1
       x[i] = int(x[i])
   ```
   - x becomes [1, 1]

3. `a = x[0]` → a = 1
4. `b = x[1]` → b = 1

5. `print(min(x), end=' ')`
   - `min([1, 1])` = 1
   - This prints "1 " (with space, no newline because of end=' ')

6. Check the condition: `if abs(a - b) >= 2:`
   - `abs(1 - 1)` = 0
   - Is 0 >= 2? No, condition is False

7. Execute else branch: `print(0)`
   - This prints "0" (followed by default newline)

Combined output: "1 0"
