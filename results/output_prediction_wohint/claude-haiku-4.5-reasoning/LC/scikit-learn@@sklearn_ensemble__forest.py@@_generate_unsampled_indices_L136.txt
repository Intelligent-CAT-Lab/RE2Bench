[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_generate_unsampled_indices`:

Given inputs:
- random_state = 209652396
- n_samples = 150
- n_samples_bootstrap = 150

Step 1: Call `_generate_sample_indices(209652396, 150, 150)`
- Creates a numpy RandomState with seed 209652396
- Calls `randint(0, 150, 150, dtype=np.int32)` which generates 150 random integers in range [0, 149]
- Returns sample_indices as a numpy array

Step 2: `sample_counts = np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=150)`
- This creates a count array of length 150
- Each index contains how many times that index appeared in sample_indices
- Since we're sampling with replacement from 150 items, some indices appear multiple times and some don't appear at all

Step 3: `unsampled_mask = sample_counts == 0`
- Creates a boolean array indicating which indices had count 0 (were never sampled)

Step 4: `indices_range = np.arange(150)`
- Creates array [0, 1, 2, ..., 149]

Step 5: `unsampled_indices = indices_range[unsampled_mask]`
- Selects only the indices that were never sampled

The challenge here is that the exact output depends on the random numbers generated by numpy's RandomState(209652396).randint(0, 150, 150). Without actually executing this code, I cannot determine the exact sequence of random integers that will be generated by that specific seed.

However, I can reason about the statistical expectation: with 150 samples from 150 items (with replacement), we expect approximately e^(-1) ≈ 36.8% of indices to not be sampled, which means roughly 55 indices would be unsampled.

Since I cannot execute numpy code to get the exact random sequence from this seed, I cannot provide the precise output array. The output would be a numpy array containing the indices that were never selected during the random sampling process.

[OUTPUT]
I cannot provide a definitive answer for this function because the output depends on numpy's random number generation with seed 209652396, which requires actual code execution to determine. 

The output structure would be:
```json
{
    "unsampled_indices": "numpy.ndarray of integers in range [0, 149] representing indices never sampled during bootstrap"
}
```

To predict the exact values, I would need to execute `numpy.random.RandomState(209652396).randint(0, 150, 150)` which determines which indices get sampled. Without executing this, the specific array contents cannot be accurately predicted. 

Statistically, with bootstrap sampling (150 samples from 150 with replacement), we expect approximately 55-56 indices to remain unsampled, but their specific identities depend on the deterministic random sequence from that seed.
