[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the `update_currency_rate` function:

1. The function receives:
   - currency = "CNY"
   - new_rate = 7.18
   - self.rates contains "CNY" in the dictionary

2. First check: `if currency not in self.rates:`
   - "CNY" IS in self.rates (it's present with value 7.18)
   - So this condition is False, and we don't execute the return False statement

3. Next line: `self.rates[currency] = new_rate`
   - This sets self.rates["CNY"] = 7.18
   - The dictionary is modified (though the value remains the same)

4. The function ends. Since there's no explicit return statement after the assignment, the function implicitly returns None.
