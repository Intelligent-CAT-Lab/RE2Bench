[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step with the input "2.4".

1. `num = input().split('.')`
   - input() returns "2.4"
   - split('.') splits the string by the dot character
   - num becomes ["2", "4"]

2. `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
   - num[0] is "2"
   - num[0][-1] is the last character of "2", which is "2"
   - int("2") = 2
   - 2 == 9 evaluates to False, so this branch does not execute

3. `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
   - num[1] is "4"
   - num[1][0] is the first character of "4", which is "4"
   - int("4") = 4
   - 4 >= 5 evaluates to False, so this branch does not execute

4. `else:`
   - This branch executes since both previous conditions were false
   - `print(num[0])` prints "2"

The output will be "2"
