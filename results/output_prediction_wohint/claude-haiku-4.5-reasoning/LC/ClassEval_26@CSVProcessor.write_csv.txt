[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution:

1. The `write_csv` method is called with:
   - `data` = [["a", "b", "c", "d"], ["ME"]]
   - `file_name` = "read_test_process.csv"

2. The method enters a try block

3. It opens the file "read_test_process.csv" in write mode ('w') with newline=''

4. Creates a csv.writer object from the file

5. Calls `writer.writerows(data)` which writes the two rows:
   - Row 1: a,b,c,d
   - Row 2: ME

6. The file is closed when exiting the with block

7. Since no exceptions occur during file operations, the method reaches the `return 1` statement

8. The method returns 1 (integer indicating success)
