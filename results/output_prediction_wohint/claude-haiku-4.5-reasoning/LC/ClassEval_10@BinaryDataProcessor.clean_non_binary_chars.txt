[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. The `clean_non_binary_chars()` method is called on an instance with `binary_string = "01101000011011010110001001101111"`

2. Inside the method:
   - `filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string)` filters the binary_string to keep only characters that are either '0' or '1'
   - Looking at the input string "01101000011011010110001001101111", every single character is already either '0' or '1'
   - So all characters pass the filter

3. `''.join(...)` combines all filtered characters back into a string, which gives us the original string unchanged: "01101000011011010110001001101111"

4. This result is assigned back to `self.binary_string`

5. The method has no explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`

Note: The method modifies the object's state but returns no value.
