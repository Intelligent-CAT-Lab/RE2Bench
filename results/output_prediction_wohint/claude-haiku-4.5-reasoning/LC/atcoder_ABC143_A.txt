[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

1. `input()` reads the input string "20 30"
2. `.split()` splits the string by whitespace: ["20", "30"]
3. `map(int, ...)` converts both elements to integers
4. `A, B = ...` unpacks the values, so A = 20 and B = 30
5. `ans = A - 2 * B` calculates: ans = 20 - 2*30 = 20 - 60 = -40
6. `if ans < 0:` checks if -40 < 0, which is True
7. Since the condition is True, `ans = 0` executes, setting ans to 0
8. `print(ans)` prints 0
