[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `get_positive` function step by step.

The function signature is:
```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [e for e in l if e > 0]
```

The input provides `l = [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`

The function uses a list comprehension that iterates through each element `e` in the list `l` and includes it in the result only if `e > 0`.

Let's evaluate each element:
1. e = -1: Is -1 > 0? No, so -1 is filtered out
2. e = -2: Is -2 > 0? No, so -2 is filtered out
3. e = 4: Is 4 > 0? Yes, so 4 is included in the result
4. e = 5: Is 5 > 0? Yes, so 5 is included in the result
5. e = 6: Is 6 > 0? Yes, so 6 is included in the result

Therefore, the function returns [4, 5, 6]
