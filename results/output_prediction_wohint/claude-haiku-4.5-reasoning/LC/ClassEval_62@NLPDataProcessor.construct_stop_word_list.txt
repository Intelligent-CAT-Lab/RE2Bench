[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `construct_stop_word_list` method:

1. The method is called on an instance of NLPDataProcessor with no arguments (args and kwargs are empty).
2. Inside the method:
   - `stop_word_list` is created and initialized with the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`
   - This list is then returned

There are no conditional branches or complex logic, so the function simply creates and returns a list containing three strings: 'a', 'an', and 'the'.

The output will be this list.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["a", "an", "the"]
}
```
