[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_polynomial_integrate` function with the given inputs:

```python
def _polynomial_integrate(polynomials, facets, hp_params):
    dims = (x, y)
    dim_length = len(dims)  # = 2
    integral_value = S.Zero
    for deg in polynomials:  # deg will be "2"
        poly_contribute = S.Zero
        facet_count = 0
        for hp in hp_params:  # hp_params is None!
            ...
```

The function is called with:
- polynomials = {"2": "x*y"}
- facets = None
- hp_params = None

The execution flow:
1. dims = (x, y)
2. dim_length = 2
3. integral_value = S.Zero
4. The outer loop `for deg in polynomials:` begins with deg = "2"
5. poly_contribute = S.Zero
6. facet_count = 0
7. The inner loop `for hp in hp_params:` attempts to iterate over None

Since `hp_params` is `None`, attempting to iterate over it with `for hp in hp_params:` will raise a `TypeError` because None is not iterable. This error occurs before any other code in the function can execute.

```
{
    "error": "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable"
}
