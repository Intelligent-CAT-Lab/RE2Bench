[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method execution:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self`: a _StrPath instance (represented as empty dict in input)
   - `other`: the string `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`

2. First condition: `isinstance(other, PurePath)`
   - `other` is a string, not a PurePath
   - This is False, so we don't return here

3. Second condition: `isinstance(other, str)`
   - `other` IS a string
   - This is True, so we enter this block
   - A warning is issued: `warnings.warn(_MSG, RemovedInSphinx10Warning, stacklevel=2)`
   - Then we return: `self.__str__() == other`

4. Evaluating the return value:
   - `self.__str__()` converts the Path to its string representation, which would be just the path: `"/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html"`
   - `other` is the full string: `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`
   - These strings are NOT equal
     - Left side: `/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html` (just the path)
     - Right side: `_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')` (the repr-like string)
   - Therefore the comparison returns `False`

The method also issues a deprecation warning but the primary output is the boolean return value.
