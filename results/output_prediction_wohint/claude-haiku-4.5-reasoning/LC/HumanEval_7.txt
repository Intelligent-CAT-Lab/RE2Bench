[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function step by step.

The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring, and returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that contain the substring.

Given:
- strings: ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- substring: "run"

The function uses a list comprehension `[x for x in strings if substring in x]` which checks if "run" is contained in each string.

Let me check each string:

1. "grunt" - Does it contain "run"?
   - g-r-u-n-t
   - Looking at positions: r(1), u(2), n(3) - consecutive "run" is found
   - ✓ Include "grunt"

2. "trumpet" - Does it contain "run"?
   - t-r-u-m-p-e-t
   - Has 'r' and 'u' consecutively, but the next character is 'm', not 'n'
   - ✗ Do not include

3. "prune" - Does it contain "run"?
   - p-r-u-n-e
   - Looking at positions: r(1), u(2), n(3) - consecutive "run" is found
   - ✓ Include "prune"

4. "gruesome" - Does it contain "run"?
   - g-r-u-e-s-o-m-e
   - Has 'r' and 'u' consecutively, but the next character is 'e', not 'n'
   - ✗ Do not include

The result is ["grunt", "prune"]
