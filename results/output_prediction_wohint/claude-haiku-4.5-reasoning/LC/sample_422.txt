[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The function `f` takes `array = [1, 2, 1]` as input.

Step 1: `new_array = array.copy()`
This creates a shallow copy of the array.
`new_array` = [1, 2, 1]

Step 2: `new_array = reversed(new_array)`
The `reversed()` function returns a reverse iterator object. It will iterate through the array in reverse order.
The original array [1, 2, 1] reversed is [1, 2, 1] (it's a palindrome, so it's the same forwards and backwards).

Step 3: `return [x * x for x in new_array]`
This list comprehension iterates through the reversed iterator and squares each element:
- First element: 1 * 1 = 1
- Second element: 2 * 2 = 4
- Third element: 1 * 1 = 1

The list comprehension returns: [1, 4, 1]

{
    "output": [1, 4, 1]
