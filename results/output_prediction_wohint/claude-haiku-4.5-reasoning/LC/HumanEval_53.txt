[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `add` takes two parameters: `x` and `y`, both typed as integers.
2. From the input, we have:
   - `x = 852`
   - `y = 371`
3. The function body performs a simple addition: `return x + y`
4. We calculate: `852 + 371 = 1223`
5. The function returns `1223`
