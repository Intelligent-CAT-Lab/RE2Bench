[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function `f` step by step.

The function takes two parameters:
- `string = "UppEr"`
- `encryption = 0`

Now let's trace through the function:

1. The function checks `if encryption == 0:`
2. Since `encryption = 0`, this condition evaluates to `True`
3. When the condition is True, the function executes `return string`
4. We return the value of the `string` parameter, which is `"UppEr"`

The function returns immediately without executing the else branch (which would encode to rot13).

Therefore, the output is simply `"UppEr"`.
