[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `precision_recall_curve` with the given inputs:

```
y_true = None
probas_pred = None
pos_label = 1
sample_weight = None
```

1. `precision_recall_curve` is called and immediately calls:
   ```
   fps, tps, thresholds = _binary_clf_curve(None, None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None)
   ```

2. Inside `_binary_clf_curve`, the first operation is:
   ```
   y_type = type_of_target(y_true)
   ```
   which becomes `type_of_target(None)`

3. Inside `type_of_target(y)` with `y = None`:
   ```python
   valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) 
           and (not isinstance(y, str))
   ```
   - `isinstance(None, Sequence)` → False
   - `isinstance(None, spmatrix)` → False  
   - `hasattr(None, '__array__')` → False
   - Therefore: `valid = False and True = False`

4. The next line is:
   ```python
   if not valid:
       raise ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y)
   ```
   Since `valid` is False, this raises a `ValueError` with message: `'Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None'`

The function execution terminates with an exception before any value is returned.

```
{
    "error": "ValueError",
    "message": "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None"
