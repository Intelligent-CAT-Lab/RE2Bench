[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this regex split operation.

The function calls: re.split(pattern, text)
- pattern: "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b"
- text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

The pattern matches phone numbers in format XXX-XXX-XXXX with word boundaries:
- \b = word boundary
- \d{3} = 3 digits
- - = literal hyphen
- \d{3} = 3 digits  
- - = literal hyphen
- \d{4} = 4 digits
- \b = word boundary

In the text, this pattern matches:
1. "123-456-7890" (positions 0-11)
2. "876-286-9876" (positions 24-35, after " abiguygusu ")
3. "987-762-9767" (positions 47-58, after " kjgufwycs ")

When re.split() splits by these matches, it returns the parts between the matches:
1. Before first match: "" (empty string)
2. Between matches 1 and 2: " abiguygusu "
3. Between matches 2 and 3: " kjgufwycs "
4. After last match: "" (empty string)

Result: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]
}
```
