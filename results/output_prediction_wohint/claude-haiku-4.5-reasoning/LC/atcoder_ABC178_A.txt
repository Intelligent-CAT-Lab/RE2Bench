[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `x = int(input())` - This reads the input "1" and converts it to an integer. So x = 1.
2. `if x == 1:` - This checks if x equals 1. Since x is 1, the condition evaluates to True.
3. `print(0)` - Since the if condition is true, this line executes and prints 0.
4. The else block is not executed.

The output will be: 0
