[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `binary_log_loss` function step by step.

Input parameters:
- y_true: 72×3 boolean array
- y_prob: 72×3 float array with values between ~0.003 and ~0.963
- sample_weight: None

The function execution:

1. `eps = np.finfo(y_prob.dtype).eps` - Gets machine epsilon for float (very small value, ~2.22e-16)

2. `y_prob = np.clip(y_prob, eps, 1 - eps)` - Clips values to [eps, 1-eps]. Since all y_prob values are already well away from 0 and 1, this has minimal effect.

3. The core computation:
   - `xlogy(y_true, y_prob)` produces: y_true * log(y_prob) except when y_true=0, then 0
   - `xlogy(1 - y_true, 1 - y_prob)` produces: (1-y_true) * log(1-y_prob) except when (1-y_true)=0, then 0
   - For each element, this gives the binary cross-entropy loss: y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p)

4. Since these are log values of probabilities < 1, the results are negative values.

5. `np.average(..., axis=0)` - Averages along rows (axis 0), producing a shape (3,) array with one mean per column

6. `.sum()` - Sums these 3 column means = (sum_col_0 + sum_col_1 + sum_col_2) / 72

7. The negative sign negates the final result.

Let me estimate the magnitudes:
- Column 1 has high probabilities (0.7-0.96) with mostly True labels → good predictions → loss elements ≈ -0.1 to -0.3
- Column 0 has mixed probabilities with mixed labels → loss elements ≈ -0.5 to -1.0
- Column 2 has very low probabilities (0.003-0.33) with many True labels → bad predictions → loss elements ≈ -1.5 to -2.5

Average loss per element across all values is approximately -0.7 to -0.8.

Total sum of all 216 loss values ≈ -150 to -160

Result = -(total_sum / 72) = -(-155 / 72) ≈ 2.15 to 2.25

Considering the distribution more carefully:
- The sum of averages per column: approximately (-0.7) + (-0.65) + (-1.0) ≈ -2.35 per column-mean units
- When we average and sum: this equivalent to operating on approximately (-155-160 / 72)

Based on typical cross-entropy values for this type of prediction data with moderate quality predictions mixed with some poor predictions, the result should be approximately 2.1 to 2.3.
