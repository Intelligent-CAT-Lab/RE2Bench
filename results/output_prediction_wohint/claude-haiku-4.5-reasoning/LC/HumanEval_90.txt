[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given input:
```
lst = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]
```

Step 1: `lst = sorted(set(lst))`
- `set(lst)` converts the list to a set to remove duplicates: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `sorted()` converts it back to a sorted list in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After this step, `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Step 2: `return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]`
- `len(lst)` = 5 (the list has 5 elements)
- The condition `len(lst) < 2` evaluates to `5 < 2` which is False
- Since the condition is False, we execute the else branch: `return lst[1]`
- `lst[1]` refers to the element at index 1, which is `2`
- The function returns `2`
