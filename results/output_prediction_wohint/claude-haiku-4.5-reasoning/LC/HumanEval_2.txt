[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `truncate_number` step by step.

The function takes a single argument:
- `number = 1.33`

The function performs:
```
return number % 1.0
```

The `%` operator is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder after division.

So we need to compute: `1.33 % 1.0`

In Python, `a % b` returns the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

For `1.33 % 1.0`:
- 1.33 divided by 1.0 gives a quotient of 1 with remainder 0.33
- More precisely: 1.33 = 1 × 1.0 + 0.33
- So the remainder is 0.33

Therefore, the function returns `0.33`

This operation extracts the fractional part of the number (the decimal portion), effectively truncating the integer part.
