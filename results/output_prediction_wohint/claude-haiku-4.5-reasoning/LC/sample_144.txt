[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with `vectors = []` (an empty list)
2. `sorted_vecs = []` - Initialize an empty list to store the sorted vectors
3. `for vec in vectors:` - Start a loop that iterates over each vector in the `vectors` list
   - Since `vectors` is an empty list `[]`, there are no elements to iterate over
   - The loop body never executes
4. `return sorted_vecs` - Return the `sorted_vecs` list, which is still empty `[]`

Since no iterations occur in the for loop, `sorted_vecs` remains an empty list.
