[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_simple_power(x, n)` with x=1 and n=1:

1. The function is called with parameters x=1 and n=1
2. First line: Check `if n == 1:`
   - n is 1, so this condition evaluates to True
3. Inside the if block: `return x == 1`
   - x is 1, so `x == 1` evaluates to True
4. The function returns True immediately without executing the while loop

The function is designed to check if x is a simple power of n. When n=1, the only number that is a power of 1 is 1 itself (since 1^k = 1 for any k). So it checks if x equals 1, which it does.
