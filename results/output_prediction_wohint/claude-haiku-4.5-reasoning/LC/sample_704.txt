[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given inputs:
- s = "."
- n = 0
- c = "99"

Execution:

1. `width = len(c) * n`
   - len("99") = 2
   - width = 2 * 0 = 0

2. `for _ in range(width - len(s)):`
   - width - len(s) = 0 - len(".") = 0 - 1 = -1
   - range(-1) produces an empty range (since -1 is negative, no iterations occur)
   - The loop body never executes

3. `return s`
   - Since the loop never executed, s remains unchanged
   - Returns "."
