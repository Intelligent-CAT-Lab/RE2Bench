Let me trace through the `_cmp_name` function with the given inputs:

Input:
- x = <class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>
- y = <class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>

Step-by-step execution:

1. Get the class names:
   - n1 = x.__name__ = "ImaginaryUnit"
   - n2 = y.__name__ = "Pi"

2. Check if n1 == n2:
   - "ImaginaryUnit" == "Pi" → False, so continue

3. Check if not issubclass(y, Basic):
   - Pi should be a subclass of Basic, so issubclass(y, Basic) = True
   - Therefore `not issubclass(y, Basic)` = False, so continue

4. Set UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1
   - ordering_of_classes is a list defined in SymPy containing ordering of class names

5. Find indices:
   - Try to get i1 = ordering_of_classes.index("ImaginaryUnit")
   - Try to get i2 = ordering_of_classes.index("Pi")
   - In SymPy's typical class ordering, both ImaginaryUnit and Pi are fundamental constants that should be in the list

6. Assuming both are found in ordering_of_classes (as these are core SymPy constants):
   - Typical SymPy ordering has ImaginaryUnit before Pi
   - So i1 < i2

7. Since both are found (not UNKNOWN), execute:
   - return (i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2)
   - = (False) - (True)
   - = 0 - 1
   - = -1

The comparison returns -1, indicating that x (ImaginaryUnit) should come before y (Pi) in the ordering.
