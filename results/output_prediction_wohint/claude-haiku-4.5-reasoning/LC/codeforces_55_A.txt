[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

```python
n = int(input())
while n % 2 == 0:
    n /= 2
if n == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

Input: "9"

1. `n = int(input())` - converts the input "9" to integer, so n = 9
2. `while n % 2 == 0:` - checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it's even)
   - 9 % 2 = 1 (9 is odd), so the condition is False
   - The while loop does not execute
3. `if n == 1:` - checks if n equals 1
   - n is still 9, so 9 == 1 is False
4. `else:` - since the if condition is False, execute the else branch
5. `print('NO')` - outputs "NO"

The code is essentially checking if a number is a power of 2 (by repeatedly dividing by 2 until we get something that can't be divided by 2 anymore). Since 9 is odd, it can't be divided by 2 at all, and it's not 1, so it's not a power of 2. Therefore, it prints 'NO'.
