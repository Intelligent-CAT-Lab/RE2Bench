[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a BankAccount object with balance = 0
2. We call deposit(amount=300)
3. Inside the deposit method:
   - First, check if amount < 0: 300 < 0 is False, so no ValueError is raised
   - Update balance: self.balance += amount → 0 + 300 = 300
   - Return self.balance: returns 300

The output of the deposit method will be the updated balance value, which is 300.
