[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `__format_line_feed`.

The method is:
```python
@staticmethod
def __format_line_feed(text):
    return re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)
```

With input `text = "Some sentence here."`

Step-by-step:
1. `re.compile('\\n+')` creates a compiled regex pattern that matches one or more consecutive newline characters (\n).
2. `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)` performs string substitution:
   - pattern: `\\n+` (matches one or more newlines)
   - replacement: `'\n'` (single newline)
   - string: `"Some sentence here."`

The input text "Some sentence here." contains no newline characters. The regex pattern `\\n+` looks for one or more newlines, but since there are none in the input string, no matches are found.

When `re.sub` finds no matches, it returns the original string unchanged.

Therefore, the output is `"Some sentence here."`
