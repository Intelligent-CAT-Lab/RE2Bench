[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The `subtract` method is a static method that takes two complex number parameters c1 and c2.

From the input:
- c1 = "(-1+2j)" - this string represents the complex number -1+2j
- c2 = "(-3+4j)" - this string represents the complex number -3+4j

The method performs:
1. `real = c1.real - c2.real` = (-1) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2
2. `imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag` = 2 - 4 = -2
3. `return complex(real, imaginary)` = complex(2, -2)

In Python, complex(2, -2) creates a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -2, which is represented as (2-2j).

When converted to a string for JSON output, this is represented as "(2-2j)".
