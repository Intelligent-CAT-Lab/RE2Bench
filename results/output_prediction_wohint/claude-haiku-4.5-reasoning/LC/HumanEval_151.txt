[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The function `double_the_difference(lst)` takes a list and:
1. Iterates through each element `i` in `lst`
2. Filters elements where:
   - `i > 0` (i is positive)
   - `i % 2 != 0` (i is odd)
   - `'.' not in str(i)` (the string representation doesn't contain a decimal point)
3. Squares each filtered element (`i ** 2`)
4. Returns the sum of all squared elements

Given input: `lst = []` (an empty list)

Since `lst` is an empty list, the list comprehension `[i ** 2 for i in lst if ...]` will iterate over zero elements.

Therefore:
- The list comprehension produces: `[]` (empty list)
- `sum([])` evaluates to `0` (the sum of an empty sequence is 0 by default)

The function returns `0`.
