[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code:

1. The CalendarUtil class has an __init__ method and an add_event method.
2. According to the input, self.events already contains one event (the New Year event).
3. We're calling add_event with another event parameter (also the New Year event with the same details).
4. The add_event method executes: `self.events.append(event)`
5. This appends the provided event to the self.events list.
6. The add_event method does not have a return statement.
7. In Python, when a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns None.

Therefore, the output (return value) of the add_event function is None.

Note: The side effect is that self.events would now contain 2 events (the original one plus the newly appended one), but the function's return value is None.
