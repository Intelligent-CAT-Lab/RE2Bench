[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `f` step by step:

1. The function takes two parameters: `array` and `elem`
2. Input values are:
   - `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]`
   - `elem = 6`

3. First, check the condition: `if elem in array`
   - Is 6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]? YES, 6 is present in the array.

4. Since the condition is True, we execute the return statement in the if block:
   - `return array.index(elem)`
   - `array.index(6)` returns the index of the first occurrence of 6 in the array
   - In the array [6, 2, 7, 1], the element 6 is at index 0
   - So `array.index(6)` returns 0

5. The function returns 0
