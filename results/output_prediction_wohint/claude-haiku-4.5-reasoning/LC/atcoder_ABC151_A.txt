[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The code is:
```python
print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))
```

The input is provided as JSON:
```
{
    "input": "\"a\""
}
```

Let me parse the JSON carefully. In JSON, `\"` is an escape sequence representing a quote character. So the string `"\"a\""` represents the value: `"a"` (which is three characters: a quote, the letter 'a', and another quote).

However, when this is passed to the program:
- `input()` would return the string `"a"` (3 characters)
- `ord()` function expects a single character as input
- Calling `ord()` on a string with 3 characters would raise a `TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 3 found`

But given the structure of this problem (which expects a normal output in JSON format), I believe there may be an intent that the input should be just the single character `a`. 

Assuming the input is the single character `a`:
1. `input()` returns `a`
2. `ord('a')` returns `97`
3. `97 + 1 = 98`
4. `chr(98)` returns the character `b`
5. `print(b)` outputs: `b`
