[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The input shows that `dic` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

Execution:
1. `d = {}` - Create an empty dictionary `d`

2. `for key in dic:` - This loop iterates over all keys in `dic`. Since `dic` is an empty dictionary `{}`, there are no keys to iterate over. Therefore, the loop body never executes.

3. `return d` - Return `d`, which is still an empty dictionary `{}`

The function creates an empty dictionary `d` and would have populated it by iterating through the keys of `dic` and extracting values using `popitem()`. However, since `dic` is empty, the loop doesn't execute, and the function simply returns the empty dictionary `d`.
