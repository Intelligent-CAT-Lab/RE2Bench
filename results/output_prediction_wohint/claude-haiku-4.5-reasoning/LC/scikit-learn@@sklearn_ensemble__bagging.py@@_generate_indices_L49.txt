[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_generate_indices`:

Given input:
- random_state: A RandomState object (represented as string but would be actual object)
- bootstrap: true
- n_population: 4
- n_samples: 1

Execution:
1. The function checks `if bootstrap:` - this is true
2. Since bootstrap is True, it executes: `indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)`
3. This translates to: `indices = random_state.randint(0, 4, 1)`

The method `randint(low, high, size)` on a numpy RandomState object:
- Generates random integers from the discrete uniform distribution
- low=0, high=4 (exclusive upper bound), size=1
- Returns a numpy array of shape (1,) containing one random integer in the range [0, 4)
- So the possible values are: 0, 1, 2, or 3

The function returns this numpy array.

When serialized to JSON, a numpy array is typically represented as a Python list.
Since I cannot determine the exact random state from the input string representation, I'll represent the output as the array would look with one of the possible integer values. I'll use 0 as a representative value.

The return value would be a 1-D array that when converted to JSON list format would be: [0]
(could be [1], [2], or [3] depending on the internal state of the random generator)
