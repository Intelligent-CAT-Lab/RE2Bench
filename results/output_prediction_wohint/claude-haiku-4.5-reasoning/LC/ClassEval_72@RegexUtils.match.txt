[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `match` method.

1. The method is called with:
   - pattern: "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
   - text: "iustd87t2euhifg.com"

2. The pattern is an email validation regex that requires:
   - Word boundary \b
   - One or more alphanumeric/special chars
   - An @ symbol (required)
   - One or more alphanumeric/dot/hyphen
   - A literal dot \
   - Two or more letters
   - Word boundary \b

3. The text "iustd87t2euhifg.com" does NOT contain an @ symbol, which is required by the pattern.

4. `re.match(pattern, text)` will return `None` because the pattern cannot be matched at the beginning of the text (and the entire text doesn't match the pattern).

5. Since `ans` is `None`, which is falsy, the condition `if ans:` evaluates to False.

6. The function returns `False`.
