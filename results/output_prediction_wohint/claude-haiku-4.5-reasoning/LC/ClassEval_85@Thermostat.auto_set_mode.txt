[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `auto_set_mode`:

1. We have a Thermostat instance with:
   - `self.current_temperature = 25`
   - `self.target_temperature = 25`
   - `self.mode = "cool"`

2. The method `auto_set_mode()` is called with no arguments.

3. Inside `auto_set_mode()`:
   - We evaluate: `if self.current_temperature < self.target_temperature:`
   - Check: is `25 < 25`? This is `False`
   - Since the condition is `False`, we go to the `else` clause
   - Execute: `self.mode = 'cool'`

4. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns `None`

The method modifies the object state but doesn't return anything explicit.
