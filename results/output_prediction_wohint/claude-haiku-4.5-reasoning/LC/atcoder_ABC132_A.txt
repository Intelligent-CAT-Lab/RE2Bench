[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. `s = sorted(input())`
   - The input from JSON is `"\"FFEE\""`, which in JSON notation with escaped quotes represents the actual string: `"FFEE"` (including the literal quote characters at beginning and end)
   - So the input string has 6 characters: `"`, `F`, `F`, `E`, `E`, `"`
   - When we sort these characters by ASCII value:
     - `"` (ASCII 34)
     - `"` (ASCII 34)
     - `E` (ASCII 69)
     - `E` (ASCII 69)
     - `F` (ASCII 70)
     - `F` (ASCII 70)
   - Result: `s = ['"', '"', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'F']`

2. Now we check the condition: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[2] == s[3] and (s[0] != s[2]):`
   - `s[0] == s[1]`: `'"' == '"'` → True
   - `s[2] == s[3]`: `'E' == 'E'` → True
   - `s[0] != s[2]`: `'"' != 'E'` → True
   - Overall: True and True and True = True

3. Since the condition is True, the code executes `print('Yes')`
