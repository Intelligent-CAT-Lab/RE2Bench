[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `check_in` method step by step.

Initial state:
- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}
- room_type = "single"
- room_number = 2
- name = "guest 1"

Step 1: Check the first condition
```python
if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():
    return False
```
- self.booked_rooms.keys() = {"single"}
- room_type = "single" is IN self.booked_rooms.keys()
- So this condition is False, we don't return and continue

Step 2: Check the second condition
```python
if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:
```
- self.booked_rooms[room_type] = self.booked_rooms["single"] = {}
- name = "guest 1" is NOT in the empty dictionary {}
- So this condition is False, we skip the nested if block

Step 3: After the second if block
- There's no code after the nested if statements
- The function ends without an explicit return statement
- In Python, functions that don't explicitly return a value implicitly return None

Therefore, the function returns None.
