[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `visit_UnaryOp` method step by step:

1. The method takes a `node` parameter of type `ast.UnaryOp`, which represents a unary operation
2. From the input, we have a UnaryOp for the expression `~1` where:
   - `node.op` is the operator (which would be `ast.Invert()` for the `~` operator)
   - `node.operand` is the operand (which would be `ast.Constant(value=1)`)

3. The method checks: `if isinstance(node.op, ast.Not)`
   - For `~1`, the operator is `Invert`, not `Not`, so this condition is **False**
   - Therefore, we go to the else branch (implicit return)

4. The method executes: `return '%s%s' % (self.visit(node.op), self.visit(node.operand))`
   - This calls `self.visit(node.op)` on the Invert operator, which would delegate to a visitor method (presumably `visit_Invert` or similar) that returns `"~"`
   - This calls `self.visit(node.operand)` on the Constant node with value 1, which would delegate to a visitor method (presumably `visit_Constant`) that returns `"1"`

5. The string formatting `'%s%s' % ("~", "1")` concatenates them with no space in between, producing `"~1"`

The method returns a string representation of the unary operation.
