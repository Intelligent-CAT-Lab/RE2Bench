[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

Given inputs:
- text = "spain"
- new_value = "b"
- index = 4

Step 1: Find `text[index]`
- text = "spain" has indices: s(0), p(1), a(2), i(3), n(4)
- text[4] = "n"

Step 2: Create translation table with `text.maketrans(text[index], new_value)`
- This becomes `text.maketrans("n", "b")`
- The `maketrans` method creates a translation table that maps each character in the first argument to the corresponding character in the second argument
- So it creates a translation table that maps "n" → "b"

Step 3: Apply `text.translate(key)` 
- This applies the translation table to the string "spain"
- It replaces all occurrences of "n" with "b"
- "spain" → "spaib"

The return value is "spaib"

    "output": "spaib"
