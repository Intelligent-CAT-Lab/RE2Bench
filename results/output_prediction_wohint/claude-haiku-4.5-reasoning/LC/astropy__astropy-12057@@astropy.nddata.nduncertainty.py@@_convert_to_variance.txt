[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_convert_to_variance`:

1. The method is called on a `VarianceUncertainty` instance
2. Looking at the method definition:
   ```python
   def _convert_to_variance(self):
       return self
   ```
3. The method simply returns `self` - the current instance that the method was called on.
4. Therefore, the output would be the same `VarianceUncertainty` object with all its current attributes intact.

The input object has:
- `_unit`: with `_bases=null`, `_powers=null`, `_scale=1.0`
- `_array`: the 2D array data
- `_parent_nddata`: null

Since the method returns `self`, the output is the same object with unchanged attributes.

[OUTPUT]
```json
{
    "_unit": {
        "_bases": null,
        "_powers": null,
        "_scale": 1.0
    },
    "_array": "[[  1.   4.   9.  16.  25.]\n [ 36.  49.  64.  81. 100.]]",
    "_parent_nddata": null
}
```
