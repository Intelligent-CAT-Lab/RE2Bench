[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `dup_abs` function execution:

1. The function signature is: `def dup_abs(f: dup[Eabs], K: Domain[Eabs]) -> dup[Eabs]:`
2. Given inputs:
   - `f = [2]` (a list containing one coefficient: 2)
   - `K = "ZZ"` (representing the integer domain)

3. The function executes a list comprehension: `[K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]`

4. Iterating through f:
   - First iteration: `coeff = 2`
   - Call `K.abs(2)` which computes the absolute value of 2
   - Result: 2 (since 2 is already positive, abs(2) = 2)

5. The list comprehension produces: `[2]`

6. This list is returned as the result.
