[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `right_angle_triangle` function with the given inputs.

Given:
- a = 10
- b = 6
- c = 8

The function checks three conditions using the Pythagorean theorem to see if any arrangement of these three sides forms a right angle triangle:

1. First condition: `a * a == b * b + c * c`
   - Left side: 10 * 10 = 100
   - Right side: 6 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 36 + 64 = 100
   - 100 == 100 → True

Since the first condition evaluates to True, and they are connected with `or` operators, the entire expression becomes True immediately. The function returns True without needing to evaluate the remaining conditions.
