[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the `heal` method step by step.

Given the input object:
- name: "John"
- hp: 100
- attack_power: 20
- defense: 10
- level: 1
- exp: 0

The `heal` method executes:
1. `self.hp += 10` → hp becomes 100 + 10 = 110
2. `if self.hp > 100:` → Check if 110 > 100, which is True
3. `self.hp = 100` → Set hp to 100 (cap at maximum)
4. `return self.hp` → Returns 100
