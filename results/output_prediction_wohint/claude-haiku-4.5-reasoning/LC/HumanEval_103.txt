Let me execute this function step by step with n = 185 and m = 546.

Step 1: Check if m < n
- Is 546 < 185? No, so we continue (don't return -1)

Step 2: Initialize summation = 0

Step 3: Loop through range(185, 547) and sum all values
- We need to sum integers from 185 to 546 (inclusive)
- Using the formula for sum of consecutive integers: (count × (first + last)) / 2
- Count = 546 - 185 + 1 = 362
- Sum = 362 × (185 + 546) / 2 = 362 × 731 / 2 = 264,422 / 2 = 132,211
- summation = 132,211

Step 4: Calculate and round the average
- average = summation / (m - n + 1)
- average = 132,211 / (546 - 185 + 1)
- average = 132,211 / 362
- average = 365.5
- round(365.5) = 366

Step 5: Convert to binary
- bin(366) converts 366 to its binary representation
- 366 in binary: 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 2^8 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
- 366 = 101101110 in binary
- bin(366) = '0b101101110'

Step 6: Return the result
- The function returns '0b101101110'
