[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_coeff_isneg(a)` where `a` represents the expression `cos(2*phi)/2`:

1. First condition: `if a.is_MatMul:`
   - The expression `cos(2*phi)/2` is not a MatMul object, so this condition is False
   - No assignment happens

2. Second condition: `if a.is_Mul:`
   - In SymPy, `cos(2*phi)/2` is represented as `cos(2*phi) * (1/2)`, which is a `Mul` object
   - This condition is True
   - `a = a.args[0]` extracts the first argument of the Mul
   - SymPy typically orders Mul factors with numeric coefficients first, then symbolic terms
   - So `a.args` would be `(Rational(1,2), cos(Mul(2, phi)))`
   - Therefore, `a = Rational(1, 2)`

3. Return statement: `return a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative`
   - Now `a` is `Rational(1, 2)`
   - `a.is_Number` evaluates to True (Rational is a Number type)
   - `a.is_extended_negative` evaluates to False (1/2 is positive, not negative)
   - `True and False` evaluates to `False`

The function returns `False`.
