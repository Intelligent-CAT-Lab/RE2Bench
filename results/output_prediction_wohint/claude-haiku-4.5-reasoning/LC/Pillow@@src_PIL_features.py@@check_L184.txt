[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `check("freetype2")`:

1. The function checks three conditions in order:
   - `if feature in modules:` - Is "freetype2" in the modules dictionary?
   - `if feature in codecs:` - Is "freetype2" in the codecs dictionary?
   - `if feature in features:` - Is "freetype2" in the features dictionary?

2. In the Pillow library, "freetype2" is a standard module that's registered in the `modules` dictionary (used to check if optional font rendering support is available).

3. Since "freetype2" would be in `modules`, the function calls `check_module("freetype2")`.

4. Inside `check_module("freetype2")`:
   - It retrieves the module name from `modules["freetype2"]`, which in Pillow maps to something like "PIL._imagingft" (the C extension module for font support)
   - It attempts: `__import__("PIL._imagingft")`
   - If the import succeeds: returns True
   - If ModuleNotFoundError occurs: returns False
   - If ImportError occurs: warns and returns False

5. The result depends on whether freetype2 support is compiled into the Pillow installation. In a standard Pillow installation with freetype2 support available, the import would succeed and return True.

Since this appears to be a standard environment query and freetype2 is a common feature of most Pillow installations, the import should succeed.
