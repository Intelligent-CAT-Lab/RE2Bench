[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step:

1. data = [1, 1, 1]
2. n = len([1, 1, 1]) = 3
3. mean = sum([1, 1, 1]) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
4. Calculate variance:
   - For each x in data: (x - mean) ** 2
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   - Sum = 0
   - variance = 0 / 3 = 0
5. std_deviation = math.sqrt(0) = 0.0
6. Calculate skewness:
   - The condition checks: if std_deviation != 0 else 0
   - Since std_deviation = 0.0, the condition is False
   - Therefore, skewness = 0
7. Return 0
