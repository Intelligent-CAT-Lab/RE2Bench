[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `math_to_image` function step by step:

1. **Parse the math expression:**
   - `parser = MathTextParser('path')` creates a parser with output type mapped to 'vector'
   - `parser.parse("$x^2$", dpi=72, prop=None)` parses the LaTeX math expression
   - This returns a tuple of (width, height, depth, _, _) representing the dimensions of the rendered expression

2. **Create a figure:**
   - `fig = figure.Figure(figsize=(width / 72.0, height / 72.0))` creates a figure with size proportional to the parsed dimensions
   - The figsize is in inches (dividing points by 72 converts to inches at 72 dpi)

3. **Add text to the figure:**
   - `fig.text(0, depth / height, s, fontproperties=None, color=None)` adds the math expression text to the figure
   - Position is at x=0, y=depth/height with no specific properties

4. **Save the figure:**
   - `fig.savefig(filename_or_obj, dpi=None, format=None)` saves the rendered figure to the specified PNG file
   - This executes the saving operation with default dpi and inferred format from the filename

5. **Return depth:**
   - The function returns the `depth` value extracted from the parser result
   - For the expression "$x^2$", the depth represents how far the rendered text extends below the baseline
   - Since 'x' is a regular character (not descending like 'g' or 'y') and '^2' is a superscript positioned above the baseline, the depth value should be close to 0

Without executing the actual matplotlib mathtext parser, the exact numerical value cannot be determined with certainty. However, based on typical mathtext behavior for an expression without descenders, the depth value would likely be 0.0 or a very small positive value.

Given typical matplotlib rendering for "x^2", a reasonable estimate would be approximately 0.0.

[/OUTPUT]

Note: The exact return value depends on matplotlib's internal mathtext parser output for the expression "$x^2$" at 72 dpi. The function returns the `depth` value (how far the text extends below the baseline). For this simple superscript expression with no descending characters, it is estimated to be approximately 0.0. The function also has the side effect of saving an image file to the specified location.
