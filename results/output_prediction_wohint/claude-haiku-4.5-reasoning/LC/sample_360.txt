[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function step by step with the given inputs:

Given:
- `text` = "g"
- `n` = 15

1. First line checks: `if len(text) <= 2:`
   - `len("g")` = 1
   - Is 1 <= 2? Yes, this condition is True
   
2. Since the condition is True, we execute the return statement in the if block:
   - `return text` returns "g"
   
3. The function exits here and doesn't execute the remaining lines (`leading_chars = ...` and the final return statement).

Therefore, the output is simply "g".

```
{
    "output": "g"
}
