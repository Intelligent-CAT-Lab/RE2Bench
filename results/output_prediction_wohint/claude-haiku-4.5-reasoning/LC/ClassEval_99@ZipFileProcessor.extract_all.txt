[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step by step.

1. `ZipFileProcessor.__init__` is called with `file_name = ""`, so `self.file_name = ""`

2. `extract_all("")` is called with `output_path = ""`

3. Inside `extract_all`, we enter the try block:
   - We attempt to execute `zipfile.ZipFile("", 'r')`
   - This tries to open an empty string as a file path in read mode
   - Since an empty string is not a valid file path and no such file exists, this will raise an exception (FileNotFoundError or similar)

4. The exception is caught by the except clause, which has a bare `except:` that catches all exceptions

5. The function returns `False`
