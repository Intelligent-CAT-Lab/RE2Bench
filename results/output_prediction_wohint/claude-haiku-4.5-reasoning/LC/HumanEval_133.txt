[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given input:
- `lst = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`

The function sums the squares of the ceiling of each element in the list.

1. Initialize `squared = 0`

2. Loop through each element in lst:

   First iteration: `i = -1.4`
   - `math.ceil(-1.4)` = -1 (ceiling rounds towards positive infinity, so -1.4 becomes -1)
   - `(-1) ** 2 = 1`
   - `squared += 1` → squared = 0 + 1 = 1

   Second iteration: `i = 17.9`
   - `math.ceil(17.9)` = 18 (ceiling of 17.9 rounds up to 18)
   - `18 ** 2 = 324`
   - `squared += 324` → squared = 1 + 324 = 325

   Third iteration: `i = 18.9`
   - `math.ceil(18.9)` = 19 (ceiling of 18.9 rounds up to 19)
   - `19 ** 2 = 361`
   - `squared += 361` → squared = 325 + 361 = 686

   Fourth iteration: `i = 19.9`
   - `math.ceil(19.9)` = 20 (ceiling of 19.9 rounds up to 20)
   - `20 ** 2 = 400`
   - `squared += 400` → squared = 686 + 400 = 1086

3. Return `squared = 1086`
