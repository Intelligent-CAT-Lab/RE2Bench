[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the `greatest_common_divisor` function step by step with inputs a=10 and b=15.

This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

Initial state:
- a = 10
- b = 15

**Iteration 1:**
- Check condition: while b (15 is non-zero/truthy, so continue)
- Execute: a, b = (b, a % b)
  - New a = b = 15
  - New b = a % b = 10 % 15 = 10 (remainder of 10 divided by 15 is 10)
- After iteration: a = 15, b = 10

**Iteration 2:**
- Check condition: while b (10 is non-zero/truthy, so continue)
- Execute: a, b = (b, a % b)
  - New a = b = 10
  - New b = a % b = 15 % 10 = 5 (15 divided by 10 is 1 remainder 5)
- After iteration: a = 10, b = 5

**Iteration 3:**
- Check condition: while b (5 is non-zero/truthy, so continue)
- Execute: a, b = (b, a % b)
  - New a = b = 5
  - New b = a % b = 10 % 5 = 0 (10 divided by 5 is 2 remainder 0)
- After iteration: a = 5, b = 0

**Iteration 4:**
- Check condition: while b (0 is falsy, so exit loop)

Return a = 5
