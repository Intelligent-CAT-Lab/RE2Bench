[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the `level_up` method step by step.

Initial state from input:
- self.level = 3
- self.hp = 140
- self.attack_power = 30
- self.defense = 20
- self.exp = 0

Executing `level_up()`:
1. Check if self.level < 100:
   - self.level is 3, so 3 < 100 is True
2. Since the condition is true:
   - self.level += 1 → self.level becomes 3 + 1 = 4
   - self.exp = 0 → self.exp remains 0
   - self.hp += 20 → self.hp becomes 140 + 20 = 160
   - self.attack_power += 5 → self.attack_power becomes 30 + 5 = 35
   - self.defense += 5 → self.defense becomes 20 + 5 = 25
3. Return (self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)
   - Returns (4, 160, 35, 25)
