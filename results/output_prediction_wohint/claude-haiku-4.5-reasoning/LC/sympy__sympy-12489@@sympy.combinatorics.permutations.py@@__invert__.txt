[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `__invert__`:

1. The method is called on an instance with `_array_form = None` and `_size = 5`.

2. The method attempts to execute:
   ```python
   return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))
   ```

3. To evaluate this expression, Python needs to first evaluate `_af_invert(self._array_form)`, which would be `_af_invert(None)`.

4. However, looking at the provided code, `_af_invert` is **not defined or imported anywhere**. It's called as a bare function reference (not as a method like `self._af_invert` or `_af_new._af_invert`).

5. Python will attempt to look up the name `_af_invert` in the local scope, enclosing scope, and global scope, but it won't find it since it's never defined.

6. Therefore, a `NameError` will be raised before `_af_invert` can even be called.
