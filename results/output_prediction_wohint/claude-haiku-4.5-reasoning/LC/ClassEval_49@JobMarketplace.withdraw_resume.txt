[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the `withdraw_resume` method:

1. The method is called with `resume = {"name": "Tom", "skills": ["skill1", "skill2"], "experience": "experience"}`
2. `self.resumes = []` (an empty list)
3. The method executes: `self.resumes.remove(resume)`
4. The `remove()` method attempts to remove the first occurrence of `resume` from `self.resumes`
5. Since `self.resumes` is empty, the resume object is not in the list
6. When `remove()` tries to remove an item that doesn't exist in the list, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "list.remove(x): x not in list"

This will raise an exception rather than returning normally.
