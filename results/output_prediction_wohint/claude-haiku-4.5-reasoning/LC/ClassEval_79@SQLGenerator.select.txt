[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. We have a SQLGenerator instance with `table_name = "table1"`
2. We're calling `select()` with:
   - `fields = None` (not provided in kwargs)
   - `condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"` (provided in kwargs)

3. In the `select` method:
   - `fields is None` evaluates to True
   - So `fields = '*'`
   - `fields = ', '.join(fields)` → joins the string '*' which just results in '*'
   - `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
   - `sql = 'SELECT * FROM table1'`

4. `condition is not None` evaluates to True (condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20")
   - `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
   - `sql = 'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`

5. `return sql + ';'`
   - Returns `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;'`
</THOUGHT>

```
{
    "output": "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
}
```
