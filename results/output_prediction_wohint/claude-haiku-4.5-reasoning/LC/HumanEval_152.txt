[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

The function `compare(game, guess)` takes two lists and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

Given:
- `game = [1, 2, 3, 5]`
- `guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]`

The function uses a list comprehension with `zip(game, guess)` to pair elements:
1. `zip(game, guess)` creates pairs: (1, -1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4)

2. For each pair (x, y), we calculate `abs(x - y)`:
   - First pair: abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(2) = 2
   - Second pair: abs(2 - 2) = abs(0) = 0
   - Third pair: abs(3 - 3) = abs(0) = 0
   - Fourth pair: abs(5 - 4) = abs(1) = 1

3. The list comprehension collects all these values into a list: [2, 0, 0, 1]

{
    "output": [2, 0, 0, 1]
}
