[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `load_image` method:

1. The method signature is: `def load_image(self, image_path):`
2. The method body contains only one line: `self.image = Image.open(image_path)`
3. This line assigns the result of `Image.open(image_path)` to `self.image`
4. However, **the method does not have an explicit return statement**

In Python, when a function or method doesn't have an explicit return statement, it implicitly returns `None`.

The method does perform the action of opening the image and storing it in `self.image`, but the return value of calling this method is `None`.
