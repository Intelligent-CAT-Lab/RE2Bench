[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `monotonic` with the given input `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`.

1. The function checks if the list is equal to its sorted version OR equal to its reverse-sorted version.

2. First condition: `l == sorted(l)`
   - `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` returns `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (ascending order)
   - `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]` evaluates to `True`

3. Since the first condition is `True`, the overall condition in the if statement is `True` (due to short-circuit evaluation with `or`).

4. The function returns `True`

Note: A list of identical elements is considered both monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing, so it returns `True`.
