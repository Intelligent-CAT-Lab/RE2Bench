[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given:
- text = "vzzv2sg"
- char = "z"

Step 1: Calculate `char * 2`
char = "z"
char * 2 = "zz"

Step 2: Calculate `count = text.count(char * 2)`
We need to count how many times "zz" appears in "vzzv2sg"
Looking at the string "vzzv2sg", the substring "zz" appears once (at positions 1-2).
count = 1

Step 3: Return `text[count:]`
This returns text[1:], which is the substring starting from index 1 to the end.
"vzzv2sg"[1:] = "zzv2sg"

So the function returns "zzv2sg"
