[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `restock_item` method:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self.inventory = {"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 10}}`
   - `item_name = "Pizza"`
   - `quantity = 10`

2. The method checks: `if item_name in self.inventory:`
   - Is "Pizza" in the inventory dictionary keys?
   - The inventory only contains "Coke" as a key
   - "Pizza" is NOT in self.inventory
   - The condition evaluates to False

3. Since the condition is False, the else block executes:
   - `return False`

Therefore, `restock_item("Pizza", 10)` returns `False`.
