[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step with the given input.

The function `f` is called with `array = []` (an empty list).

1. First while loop: `while -1 in array:`
   - We check if `-1` is in the empty list `[]`
   - Since the list is empty, `-1 in []` evaluates to `False`
   - The while loop condition is false, so we do not enter this loop

2. Second while loop: `while 0 in array:`
   - We check if `0` is in the empty list `[]`
   - Since the list is empty, `0 in []` evaluates to `False`
   - The while loop condition is false, so we do not enter this loop

3. Third while loop: `while 1 in array:`
   - We check if `1` is in the empty list `[]`
   - Since the list is empty, `1 in []` evaluates to `False`
   - The while loop condition is false, so we do not enter this loop

4. Return `array`
   - The function returns the array, which is still `[]` (unchanged)

The output is an empty list.
