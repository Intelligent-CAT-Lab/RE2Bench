[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this step by step.

1. We have a static method `multiply` that takes two complex numbers c1 and c2.

2. From the input JSON:
   - c1 = "(-1-2j)" which represents the complex number -1-2j
   - c2 = "(-3-4j)" which represents the complex number -3-4j

3. Breaking down the complex numbers:
   - c1: real = -1, imag = -2
   - c2: real = -3, imag = -4

4. Calculate the real part:
   real = c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag
        = (-1) * (-3) - (-2) * (-4)
        = 3 - 8
        = -5

5. Calculate the imaginary part:
   imaginary = c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real
             = (-1) * (-4) + (-2) * (-3)
             = 4 + 6
             = 10

6. Return complex(-5, 10) which equals -5+10j

7. In string representation, this is "(-5+10j)"

{
    "output": "(-5+10j)"
