[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

The function `remove_vowels` takes a text parameter and returns a string with all vowels removed.

Given input:
- `text = "abcdef\nghijklm"` (a string containing letters separated by a newline character)

The function uses a list comprehension that:
1. Iterates through each character `s` in the text
2. Keeps the character only if `s.lower()` is NOT in the list `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`
3. Joins all kept characters back into a string

Let me go through each character:
- 'a': 'a'.lower() = 'a' → is in vowels → SKIP
- 'b': 'b'.lower() = 'b' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'c': 'c'.lower() = 'c' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'd': 'd'.lower() = 'd' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'e': 'e'.lower() = 'e' → is in vowels → SKIP
- 'f': 'f'.lower() = 'f' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- '\n': '\n'.lower() = '\n' → NOT in vowels → KEEP (newline preserved)
- 'g': 'g'.lower() = 'g' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'h': 'h'.lower() = 'h' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'i': 'i'.lower() = 'i' → is in vowels → SKIP
- 'j': 'j'.lower() = 'j' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'k': 'k'.lower() = 'k' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'l': 'l'.lower() = 'l' → NOT in vowels → KEEP
- 'm': 'm'.lower() = 'm' → NOT in vowels → KEEP

The result after joining is: "bcdf\nghjklm"
