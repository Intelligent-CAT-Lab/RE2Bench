[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The function `f` takes a list `nums` and reverses it multiple times in a loop.

Input: `nums = [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

The loop runs `len(nums) - 1` times.
- `len(nums) = 7`
- `len(nums) - 1 = 6`

So the loop will execute 6 times, calling `nums.reverse()` each time.

Let me trace through each iteration:

**Initial:** `nums = [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

**Iteration 1:** After reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

**Iteration 2:** After reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

**Iteration 3:** After reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

**Iteration 4:** After reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

**Iteration 5:** After reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

**Iteration 6:** After reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

Since reversing a list twice returns it to its original state, and we perform an even number of reverses (6), the list returns to its original state.

The function returns `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
