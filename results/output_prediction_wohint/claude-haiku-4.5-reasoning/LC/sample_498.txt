[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of this function step by step.

The function `f(nums, idx, added)` performs a slice assignment: `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)`

Given inputs:
- `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
- `idx = 2`
- `added = 3`

The operation `nums[2:2] = (3,)` is a key operation here:
- `nums[2:2]` creates a zero-length slice at position 2 (between the element at index 1 and the element at index 2)
- When you assign a sequence to a zero-length slice, it inserts that sequence at that position
- This is equivalent to inserting the value at that index

Let me trace the insertion:
- Original list: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]` (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- We insert `3` (as a tuple `(3,)`) at index 2
- Elements at index 2 and beyond shift to the right
- New list: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`

The function then returns the modified `nums` list.
