[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this step by step.

We're calling `interval_contains` with:
- `interval`: "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"  (a string)
- `val`: -80.0

Inside the function:
```python
def interval_contains(interval, val):
    a, b = interval
    if a > b:
        a, b = (b, a)
    return a <= val <= b
```

Step 1: `a, b = interval`
When unpacking a string with `a, b = string`, Python unpacks the string character by character:
- a = 'a' (first character of "array...")
- b = 'r' (second character of "array...")

Step 2: `if a > b:`
Comparing characters: 'a' > 'r'?
In ASCII/Unicode, 'a' (97) is not greater than 'r' (114), so this is False.
The if block is not executed.

Step 3: `return a <= val <= b`
This evaluates to: `'a' <= -80.0 <= 'r'`

This attempts to compare a string with a float. In Python 3, this raises a TypeError because you cannot compare string and numeric types directly.

The comparison fails at: `'a' <= -80.0`

```
{
    "raises": "TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'float'"
}
