[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `change_base(x=4, base=5)` step by step.

Initial state:
- x = 4
- base = 5
- ret = ''

The function converts a decimal number to a specified base representation by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders.

**Iteration 1:**
- Condition check: x > 0? → 4 > 0? → True
- x % base = 4 % 5 = 4 (remainder when 4 is divided by 5)
- ret = str(4) + '' = '4'
- x = x // base = 4 // 5 = 0 (integer division)
- Now x = 0, ret = '4'

**Iteration 2:**
- Condition check: x > 0? → 0 > 0? → False
- Loop terminates

The function returns ret = '4'

This is correct because 4 in base 5 is simply '4' (since 4 < 5, it requires only one digit).
