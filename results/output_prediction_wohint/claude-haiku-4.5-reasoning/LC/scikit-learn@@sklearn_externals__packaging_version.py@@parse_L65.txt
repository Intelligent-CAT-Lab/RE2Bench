[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `parse` function with input `version="1.11.3"`:

1. The function calls `Version("1.11.3")` inside a try block
2. In the `Version.__init__` method:
   - It uses a regex to match against the version string "1.11.3"
   - "1.11.3" is a standard semantic version format and should successfully match the version regex pattern
   - The regex match extracts the version components:
     - epoch: None (not specified, defaults to 0)
     - release: "1.11.3" → split by "." → (1, 11, 3)
     - pre_l, pre_n: None (no pre-release) → pre = None
     - post_l, post_n1, post_n2: None (no post-release) → post = None
     - dev_l, dev_n: None (no dev) → dev = None
     - local: None (no local version) → local = None
   - A `_Version` namedtuple is created with these parsed components
   - A `_key` is generated for sorting
3. Since no `InvalidVersion` exception was raised, the `Version` object is successfully created and returned

The function returns a `Version` object representing version "1.11.3".
