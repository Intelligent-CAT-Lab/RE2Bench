[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `change_order_status` method step by step.

Given input:
- self.orders = {"1": {"product_id": 1, "quantity": 5, "status": "Delivered"}}
- order_id = 1 (integer)
- status = "Delivered"

Execution:
1. The method checks: `if order_id in self.orders:`
2. order_id = 1 (integer)
3. self.orders has key "1" (string, as shown in the JSON input)
4. In Python, integer 1 and string "1" are different keys in a dictionary
5. So `1 in {"1": ...}` evaluates to False
6. The condition is False, so we go to the else branch
7. The function returns False

The key issue is a type mismatch: the order_id parameter is an integer (1), but the dictionary key is a string ("1"). Python dictionaries distinguish between these, so the lookup fails.
