[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. The input is "74 74"
2. `S, W = map(int, input().split())`
   - `input()` reads the string "74 74"
   - `.split()` splits on whitespace: ["74", "74"]
   - `map(int, ...)` converts each element to integer
   - So S = 74, W = 74

3. `print('unsafe') if S <= W else print('safe')`
   - This is a conditional expression
   - Check: is S <= W?
   - Is 74 <= 74?
   - Yes, because 74 equals 74, so 74 <= 74 is True
   - When the condition is True, it prints 'unsafe'
   - When the condition is False, it would print 'safe'

4. Since 74 <= 74 is True, the output is "unsafe"

    "output": "unsafe"
