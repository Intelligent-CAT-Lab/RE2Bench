[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Input: `a, b = map(int, input().split())`
- `input()` returns the string: `80 970`
- `.split()` gives: `['80', '970']`
- `map(int, ...)` converts to integers: `a = 80`, `b = 970`

Initial state:
- `x = a = 80`
- `h = 0`
- `s = 0`

First while loop: `while x > 0:`
This loop decrements x by 1 and increments both h and s by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop runs exactly 80 times (while x goes from 80 down to 1)
- After the loop: `x = 0`, `h = 80`, `s = 80`

Second while loop: `while s // b != 0:`
Check condition: `s // b != 0`
- `s = 80`, `b = 970`
- `80 // 970 = 0`
- `0 != 0` is False

The second while loop condition is immediately false, so it never executes.

Finally: `print(h)` prints the value of `h = 80`
