[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution of `update_product_quantity`:

Given state:
- self.inventory = {"1": {"name": "product 1", "quantity": 2}} (note: key is string "1")
- self.orders = {}

Called with:
- product_id = 1 (integer)
- quantity = -3

Execution:
1. The method checks: `if product_id in self.inventory:`
2. This is checking: `if 1 in {"1": ...}:` where product_id is the integer 1
3. The inventory dictionary has a string key "1", not an integer key 1
4. In Python, 1 (int) != "1" (str), so `1 in self.inventory` evaluates to False
5. The condition is false, so the if block does not execute
6. The method completes without modifying the inventory
7. The method implicitly returns None (no explicit return statement)

The inventory remains unchanged.
