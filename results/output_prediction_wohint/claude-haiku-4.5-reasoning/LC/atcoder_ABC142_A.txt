[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. `N = int(input())` - the input is "99", so N = 99
2. `if N % 2 == 0:` - check if 99 is even
   - 99 % 2 = 1 (since 99 is odd)
   - So the condition is False, we go to the else branch
3. In the else branch: `print((N + 1) / N / 2)`
   - N = 99
   - (N + 1) / N / 2 = (99 + 1) / 99 / 2
   - = 100 / 99 / 2
   - = (100 / 99) / 2
   - = 100 / 198
   - = 50 / 99
   - In decimal: ≈ 0.5050505050505051
