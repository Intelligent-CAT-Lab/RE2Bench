[THOUGHT]
The function `calc_max_rows_first` takes a single parameter `max_rows` with value 12.

Let me trace through the execution:
1. `max_rows // 2` = `12 // 2` = `6` (integer division)
2. `max_rows % 2` = `12 % 2` = `0` (remainder of 12 divided by 2)
3. Return `6 + 0` = `6`

This function essentially returns the ceiling of max_rows/2, but using integer arithmetic. For even numbers like 12, it returns exactly half. For odd numbers, it would return the upper half due to the `+ max_rows % 2` term.
