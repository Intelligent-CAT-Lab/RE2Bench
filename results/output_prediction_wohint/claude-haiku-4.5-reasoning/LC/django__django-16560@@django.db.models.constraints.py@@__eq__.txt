[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method step by step.

1. The method checks if `other` is an instance of `CheckConstraint`
   - From the input, `other` is indeed a CheckConstraint, so the condition is True

2. Since the condition is True, we evaluate the return statement:
   ```python
   return self.name == other.name and self.check == other.check and (self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code) and (self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message)
   ```

3. Let me check each comparison:
   - `self.name == other.name`: "price" == "price" → **True**
   - `self.check == other.check`: Both have identical structure (children: null, connector: "AND", negated: false) → **True**
   - `self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code`: "custom_code" == "custom_code" → **True**
   - `self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message`: Both have identical structure with same _proxy____args and _proxy____kw → **True**

4. All comparisons are True, so: True and True and True and True → **True**
