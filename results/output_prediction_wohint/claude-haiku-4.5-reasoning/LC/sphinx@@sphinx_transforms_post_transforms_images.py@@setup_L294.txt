[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `setup` function:

1. The function takes `app: Sphinx` as a parameter (which is a SphinxTestApp with buildername='html')
2. First line: `app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader)` - This calls the add_post_transform method to register the ImageDownloader transform. This method registers the transform but doesn't return anything (returns None).
3. Second line: `app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor)` - This calls the add_post_transform method again to register the DataURIExtractor transform. Again, this returns None.
4. Third line: The function returns a dictionary with metadata:
   - 'version': 'builtin'
   - 'parallel_read_safe': True
   - 'parallel_write_safe': True

The actual return value is what gets output. The calls to `add_post_transform` have side effects (they modify the app's registry) but don't contribute to the function's return value.

```
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
