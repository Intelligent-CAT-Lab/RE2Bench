[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `is_prime(n)` with n = 13441:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for k in range(2, n - 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Step-by-step execution:

1. `n = 13441`
2. Check `if n < 2:` → `if 13441 < 2:` → False, so we don't return False here
3. Enter the for loop: `for k in range(2, 13440):` (since n-1 = 13440)
   - This will iterate k from 2 to 13439 (inclusive)
   - For each value of k, we check if `13441 % k == 0`
   - If any k divides 13441 evenly, we return False

Now I need to determine whether 13441 is prime or composite.

To check if 13441 is prime, I need to verify if it has any divisors. Any composite number must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to its square root.

√13441 ≈ 116 (since 116² = 13456 and 115² = 13225)

Let me verify divisibility by small primes:
- Divisible by 2? No (it's odd)
- Divisible by 3? Sum of digits: 1+3+4+4+1 = 13 → No
- Divisible by 5? No (doesn't end in 0 or 5)
- Divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113: Through systematic checking, none of these primes divide 13441 evenly.

Since I've checked all prime numbers up to and beyond √13441, and none of them divide 13441, **13441 is a prime number**.

Therefore:
- The for loop will iterate through all values from 2 to 13439
- None of these will satisfy `13441 % k == 0`
- The function will exit the loop normally and return `True`
