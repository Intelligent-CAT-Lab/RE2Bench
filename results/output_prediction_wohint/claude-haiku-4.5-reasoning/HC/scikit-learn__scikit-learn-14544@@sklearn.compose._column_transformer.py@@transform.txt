[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `transform` method step by step:

1. The method starts with `check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_')`. This is a scikit-learn validation function that checks if the estimator has been fitted properly. It verifies that the fitted attribute `transformers_` is not None and is properly set. In this case:
   - `self.transformers_` = None (from input)
   - This indicates the ColumnTransformer has NOT been fitted yet
   - `check_is_fitted` will raise a `NotFittedError` because `transformers_` is None

2. Before we can even reach the rest of the method (X conversion, validation checks, etc.), the `check_is_fitted` function will raise an exception.

The error that would be raised by sklearn's `check_is_fitted` when an estimator hasn't been properly fitted is `NotFittedError` with a message like: "This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator."

This happens at the very first line of the `transform` method, so we never get to process X, never call `_validate_features`, etc.
