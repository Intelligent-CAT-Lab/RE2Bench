[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `hpack` method execution step by step.

**Initial values:**
- w = 0.0
- m = "additional"
- children = [two string representations of Hlist objects]

**Step 1: Initialize variables in hpack**
- h = 0.0
- d = 0.0
- x = 0.0
- total_stretch = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
- total_shrink = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

**Step 2: Loop through self.children**
The children are string representations, not actual Char, Box, Glue, or Kern instances.
```python
for p in self.children:
    if isinstance(p, Char): False (p is a string)
    elif isinstance(p, Box): False (p is a string)
    elif isinstance(p, Glue): False (p is a string)
    elif isinstance(p, Kern): False (p is a string)
```
None of the conditions match, so nothing is added during the loop.
After loop: x = 0.0, h = 0.0, d = 0.0

**Step 3: Set height and depth**
- self.height = h = 0.0
- self.depth = d = 0.0

**Step 4: Calculate width**
- m == 'additional', so: w += x → w = 0.0 + 0.0 = 0.0
- self.width = w = 0.0

**Step 5: Calculate glue adjustment**
- x = w - x = 0.0 - 0.0 = 0.0
- Since x == 0.0 is True:
  - self.glue_sign = 0
  - self.glue_order = 0
  - self.glue_ratio = 0.0
  - return (exit function)

The _set_glue method is NOT called since the function returns early.
