[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_expand_partial_derivative`:

1. The method starts by calling:
```python
args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
```

2. To get `self.expr`, it accesses the property:
```python
@property
def expr(self):
    return self.args[0]
```

3. `self.args` is a property that returns `self._args` (from Basic class):
```python
def args(self):
    return self._args
```

4. The input JSON shows the object has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all set to `null`, but crucially, **`_args` is not specified in the input**. This indicates the object state is incomplete or improperly initialized.

5. If `_args` is an empty tuple (or not initialized), accessing `self.args[0]` would attempt to access index 0 of an empty sequence, which raises an `IndexError: tuple index out of range`.

6. Since this error occurs before the rest of the function logic can execute, the function would raise an exception rather than returning a normal value.

The incomplete object state (missing or empty `_args`) prevents the method from accessing `self.expr`, causing it to fail immediately.
