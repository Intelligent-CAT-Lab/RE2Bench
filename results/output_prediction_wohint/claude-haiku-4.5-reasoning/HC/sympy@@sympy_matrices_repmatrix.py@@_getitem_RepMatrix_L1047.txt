[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the execution of `_getitem_RepMatrix` with `key = [0, 0]`:

1. **Check if key is a tuple**: `isinstance([0, 0], tuple)` → `False`
   - Key is a list, not a tuple, so we skip the first conditional block

2. **Enter the else block** (for non-tuple keys):
   - `rows, cols = self.shape` → `rows = 3, cols = 3`
   - `if not rows * cols:` → `if not 9:` → `False` (9 is truthy, so we don't return early)
   - `rep = self._rep.rep` (gets the internal sparse representation)
   - `domain = rep.domain` → `domain = EXRAW`
   - `is_slice = isinstance(key, slice)` → `False` (key is a list, not a slice)

3. **Execute the else branch within the else block**:
   Since `is_slice` is `False`, the code executes:
   ```python
   values = [rep.getitem(*divmod(index_(key), cols))]
   ```

4. **Call operator.index on the list**:
   The code tries to call `index_([0, 0])`, which is equivalent to `operator.index([0, 0])`.
   
   According to Python's `operator.index()` function, it calls `obj.__index__()`. Since list objects don't have an `__index__` method, this raises a `TypeError`.

The function will raise: `TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`

The issue is that while the function handles tuples as 2D indices (via `isinstance(key, tuple)`), it doesn't explicitly handle lists. So when a list is passed, the code falls into the 1D indexing path and tries to convert it to an integer, which fails.
