Let me trace through the `transform` method execution step by step.

1. The `transform` method is called with `X = [[1 1 1]]` (shape 1x3)

2. It calls `_transform_selected(X, self._transform, self.dtype, self.categorical_features, copy=True)`. Based on the sklearn pattern, this function applies `self._transform` to the input. Since `categorical_features` appears to be None, I'll assume it applies to all features.

3. Inside `_transform(X)`:
   - `check_array` converts X to `[[1 1 1]]` (int array)
   - No negative values, so no error
   - `n_samples = 1, n_features = 3`
   - Check: `feature_indices_.shape[0] - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3` ✓ matches n_features
   - `mask = (X < n_values_).ravel()` = `(1 < 4, 1 < 3, 1 < 2)` = `[True, True, True]`
   - No unknown values, so no error
   
4. Computing column_indices:
   - `X + indices[:-1]` = `[[1 1 1]] + [0 4 7]` = `[[1 5 8]]`
   - `column_indices = [1 5 8]` (after ravel and mask application)

5. Computing row_indices:
   - `np.repeat(np.arange(1), 3)[mask]` = `[0 0 0]`

6. Creating sparse matrix:
   - `data = np.ones(3)` = `[1.0 1.0 1.0]`
   - Shape: (1, 9) with values at (0,1), (0,5), (0,8)

7. Since `self.n_values == 'auto'` (string), filter by `active_features_`:
   - `active_features_ = [0 3 5 6 8]`
   - Select columns `[0, 3, 5, 6, 8]` from the 9-column matrix
   - Column 1 is NOT in active_features → value at (0,1) is removed
   - Column 5 IS in active_features at index 2 → value moves to (0,2)
   - Column 8 IS in active_features at index 4 → value moves to (0,4)

8. Result: CSR sparse matrix shape (1, 5) with values 1.0 at positions (0,2) and (0,4)

9. Since `self.sparse = True`, return the sparse matrix

For JSON representation, converting the sparse matrix to dense form: `[[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]]`
