[THOUGHT]
1. The `get_family` method is called on a FontProperties instance.
2. Looking at the method definition:
```python
def get_family(self):
    return self._family
```
3. This is a simple getter that returns the `_family` attribute.
4. From the input, `self._family` is `["Helvetica"]`.
5. The method simply returns this list.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "return": ["Helvetica"]
}
```
