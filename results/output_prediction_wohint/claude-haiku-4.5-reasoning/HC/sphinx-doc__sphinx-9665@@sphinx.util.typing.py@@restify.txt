[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `restify` function with the input `cls=None`.

1. The function `restify` is called with `cls=None`
2. Inside the try block, the first condition checks:
   ```python
   if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
       return ':py:obj:`None`'
   ```
3. Since `cls` is `None`, the condition `cls is None` evaluates to `True`
4. Therefore, the function immediately returns the string `':py:obj:`None`'`

The function doesn't proceed to any other conditions since it returns early on the first if statement.

```
{
    "return": ":py:obj:`None`"
}
