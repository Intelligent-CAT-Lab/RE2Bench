[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `predict` method:

1. **check_is_fitted(self)**: The estimator has `regressor_` and `transformer_` attributes (fitted attributes), so this check passes.

2. **Check routing**: `_routing_enabled()` returns `False` by default (the configuration is not set), so the first branch is skipped.

3. **Create routed_params**: Since `predict_params` is empty (no kwargs passed):
   ```python
   routed_params = Bunch(regressor=Bunch(predict={}))
   ```

4. **Get regressor predictions**:
   ```python
   pred = self.regressor_.predict(X, **routed_params.regressor.predict)
   ```
   This calls `LinearRegression().predict(X)` where X has shape (100, 10).
   The LinearRegression returns a 1D array of predictions with shape (100,).

5. **Check prediction dimensions**:
   ```python
   if pred.ndim == 1:
       pred_trans = self.transformer_.inverse_transform(pred.reshape(-1, 1))
   ```
   Since `pred.ndim == 1` is True, we reshape pred from (100,) to (100, 1) and pass it to the FunctionTransformer's inverse_transform.
   After inverse_transform, `pred_trans` has shape (100, 1).

6. **Final squeeze**:
   ```python
   if self._training_dim == 1 and pred_trans.ndim == 2 and (pred_trans.shape[1] == 1):
       pred_trans = pred_trans.squeeze(axis=1)
   ```
   Since `_training_dim == 1`, `pred_trans.ndim == 2`, and `pred_trans.shape[1] == 1`, all conditions are True.
   The result is squeezed from (100, 1) to (100,).

7. **Return**: Returns `pred_trans`, a 1D numpy array of shape (100,).

**Important limitation**: The actual numerical values in the output array depend on:
- The fitted coefficients and intercept of LinearRegression (not provided in the input)
- The actual inverse function used by FunctionTransformer (not provided in the input)

Without these actual fitted parameters, the exact numerical output values cannot be computed. The output would be a numpy array of 100 float values, but their specific values depend on the model's learned parameters.

[OUTPUT]
```
Cannot be computed with certainty. The function would return a numpy ndarray of shape (100,) and dtype float64, but the actual numerical values cannot be determined without:
1. The fitted coefficients and intercept of the LinearRegression instance
2. The actual implementation of the inverse_func used by FunctionTransformer

The code execution flow is correct and the output shape would be (100,), but specific values require knowledge of the fitted model parameters.
