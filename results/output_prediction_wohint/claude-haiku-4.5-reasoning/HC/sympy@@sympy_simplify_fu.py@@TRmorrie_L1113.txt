[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `TRmorrie` with input `rv = "cos(phi)"` (a string).

1. `TRmorrie(rv)` is called with `rv = "cos(phi)"`
2. Inside `TRmorrie`, a nested function `f` is defined
3. The function returns `bottom_up(rv, f)` where `rv = "cos(phi)"` and `f` is the nested function

Now tracing through `bottom_up("cos(phi)", f)`:
- `args = getattr("cos(phi)", 'args', None)`
- Since `"cos(phi)"` is a string (not a SymPy expression object), strings don't have an 'args' attribute
- Therefore `args = None`
- Since `args is None`, we enter the else block
- `nonbasic` defaults to `False`, so the condition `if nonbasic:` is False
- Nothing happens in the else block
- The function returns `rv` unchanged, which is `"cos(phi)"`

The function returns the input unchanged since a plain string doesn't have the structure (no 'args' attribute) that `bottom_up` traverses.
