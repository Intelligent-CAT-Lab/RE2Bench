Let me trace through the `extract` method step by step with the given input.

**Initial State:**
- `self` is an SDM dict instance (empty based on the input)
- `self.shape = (3, 3)`, so `m = 3, n = 3`
- `self.rows = 3`, `self.cols = 3`
- `self.domain = "ZZ"`
- Method arguments: `rows = [0, 1, 2]`, `cols = [0]`

**Step 1: Check the first condition**
```python
if not (self and rows and cols):
    return self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)
```

- `bool(self)` = False (the dict contents are empty)
- `bool(rows)` = True (non-empty list [0, 1, 2])
- `bool(cols)` = True (non-empty list [0])
- `self and rows and cols` = False (short-circuit evaluation on first falsy operand)
- `not False` = True

Since the condition is True, we enter the if block and immediately return.

**Step 2: Execute the return statement**
```python
return self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)
```

This becomes:
```python
return self.zeros((3, 1), "ZZ")
```

**Step 3: The `zeros` classmethod**
```python
@classmethod
def zeros(cls, shape, domain):
    return cls({}, shape, domain)
```

This creates a new SDM instance with:
- An empty dict: `{}`
- Shape: `(3, 1)`
- Domain: `"ZZ"`
- This also sets `rows = 3` and `cols = 1` from the shape tuple

The method returns this new SDM object before executing any of the remaining logic in the `extract` method.
