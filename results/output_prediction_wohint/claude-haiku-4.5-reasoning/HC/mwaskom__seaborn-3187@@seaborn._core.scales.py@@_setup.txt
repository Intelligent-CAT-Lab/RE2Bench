[THOUGHT]

Looking at this `_setup` function, I need to trace through its execution. However, I encounter a significant problem: several critical methods and classes are not provided in the code:

1. Missing implementations for methods called by this object:
   - `new.tick()` - not provided
   - `new.label()` - not provided  
   - `new._get_transform()` - not provided
   - `new._get_scale()` - not provided

2. Missing class/object definitions:
   - `PseudoAxis` class - not defined
   - `axis.convert_units()`, `axis.set_view_interval()`, `axis.major.locator()`, `axis.major.formatter` - methods/attributes not shown

3. Incomplete input data:
   - The `prop` object only shows `{"variable": "y"}` but needs properties like `normed`, `legend`, and method `get_mapping()`
   - The `data` Series is partially represented but critical methods like `min()`, `max()` are not shown

The function flow I can trace:
1. `new = copy(self)` - creates a shallow copy
2. Calls `new.tick()` and `new.label()` since their params are None (return values unknown)
3. Gets transforms and matplotlib scale (operations unknown)
4. Creates PseudoAxis since axis is None
5. Determines if normalization applies based on `prop.normed` (value unknown)
6. Sets `_pipeline`, `_spacer`, and potentially `_legend`
7. Returns the modified `new` object

Without these implementations, I cannot accurately predict the specific state of the returned object.
