[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_construct_simple` function with the given inputs:

Input parameters:
- `coeffs = None` (null in JSON)
- `opt = {}` (empty dictionary)

Execution trace:

1. Initial variable setup:
```python
rationals = floats = complexes = algebraics = False
float_numbers = []
```

2. Next line attempts:
```python
if opt.extension is True:
```
Here, `opt` is an empty dictionary `{}`. Attempting to access `opt.extension` (using dot notation) on a dict object will raise an `AttributeError` since dictionaries don't have attributes accessed this way.

However, even if we assume this somehow succeeds and evaluates to False or None, the next critical line is:

```python
for coeff in coeffs:
```

Since `coeffs = None`, Python cannot iterate over `None`. This will immediately raise a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.

The function will crash before completing execution and will not return a normal value. The first error encountered will be when trying to iterate over the None value.
</THOUGHT>

[OUTPUT]
```json
{
  "error": "TypeError",
  "message": "'NoneType' object is not iterable",
  "details": "The function attempts to iterate over 'coeffs' which is None, causing the program to crash."
}
```
