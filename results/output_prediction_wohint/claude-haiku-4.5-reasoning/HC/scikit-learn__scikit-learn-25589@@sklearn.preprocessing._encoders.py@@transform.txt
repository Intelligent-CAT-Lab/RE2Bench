[THOUGHT]

Looking at this `transform` method call with `X=None`, let me trace through the execution:

1. **`check_is_fitted(self)` is called first**
   - This checks if the estimator has been fitted by looking for `n_features_in_`
   - The object has `n_features_in_ = 2`, so this check passes

2. **`warn_on_unknown` is computed**
   - `self.drop = "first"` (not None) → True
   - `self.handle_unknown = "ignore"` (in {'ignore', 'infrequent_if_exist'}) → True  
   - Result: `warn_on_unknown = True`

3. **`_transform(X, ...)` is called with `X=None`**
   - Inside `_transform`, it calls `self._check_feature_names(X, reset=False)` with X=None
     - `_get_feature_names(None)` returns None
     - Since both fitted and input feature names are None, this returns without error
   
   - Then it calls `self._check_n_features(X, reset=False)` with X=None
     - This tries to call `_num_features(None)`
     - In `_num_features`:
       - `hasattr(None, '__len__')` → False
       - `hasattr(None, 'shape')` → False  
       - `hasattr(None, '__array__')` → False
       - This raises `TypeError: 'Unable to find the number of features from X of type builtins.NoneType'`
     
     - Back in `_check_n_features`, the TypeError is caught:
       - Since `reset=False` and `hasattr(self, 'n_features_in_')` is True
       - It raises: `ValueError: X does not contain any features, but OneHotEncoder is expecting 2 features`

The execution fails before reaching any further code, as X is None and the estimator expects 2 features.
