# THOUGHT

Looking at the `_eval_product` method, let me trace through the execution with the given inputs:

1. The method is called with:
   - `term`: "(i**2 + 5*i + 4)/(i**2 + 2*i - 3)" (a string representation)
   - `limits`: ["u + v", "u - 1"] (a list with 2 elements)

2. The method starts with some imports (lines 1-3), which execute fine.

3. The critical line is: `k, a, n = limits`

4. In Python, this unpacking operation expects `limits` to contain exactly 3 elements, since we're unpacking into 3 variables (k, a, n).

5. However, `limits` is ["u + v", "u - 1"], which contains only **2 elements**.

6. When Python tries to unpack 2 values into 3 variables, it raises a `ValueError`.

The code never proceeds beyond the unpacking statement because the exception is raised immediately.

# OUTPUT

```json
{
    "exception_type": "ValueError",
    "exception_message": "not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)"
}
```
