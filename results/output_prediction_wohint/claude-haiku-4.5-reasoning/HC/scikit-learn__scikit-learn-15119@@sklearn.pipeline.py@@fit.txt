<THOUGHT>

Let me trace through the execution of `FeatureUnion.fit()` with the given input:

1. **Initial state**: 
   - `self.transformer_list = None`
   - `self.n_jobs = None`
   - `self.verbose = False`
   - X is a (150, 4) numpy array
   - y is a (150,) numpy array with class labels [0=50 samples, 1=50 samples, 2=50 samples]
   - kwargs = {'a': 0}, which becomes fit_params = {'a': 0}

2. **Execution flow**:
   - `fit()` is called, which immediately calls: `transformers = self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one)`

3. **In `_parallel_func()`**:
   - First line: `self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)`
   - Since `self.transformer_list` is `None`, attempting to convert `None` to a list raises a `TypeError`

4. **Error encountered**:
   - Python's `list()` function tries to iterate over the input
   - `None` is not iterable
   - Exception: `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`

The function fails at the very beginning of `_parallel_func` and never reaches the validation or iteration logic. The execution terminates with an exception being raised.
