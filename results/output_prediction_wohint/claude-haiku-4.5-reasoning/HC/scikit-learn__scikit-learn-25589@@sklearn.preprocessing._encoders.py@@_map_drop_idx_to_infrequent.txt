[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` method with the given inputs:

Given:
- `self._infrequent_enabled = False`
- `feature_idx = 1`
- `drop_idx = "0"` (a string)

Execution:
1. The first line checks: `if not self._infrequent_enabled:`
   - `self._infrequent_enabled = False`
   - `not False = True`
   - This condition is True, so we enter the if block

2. The method immediately returns `drop_idx`
   - Returns the value that was passed in: `"0"`

The function returns early on the first condition since `_infrequent_enabled` is False, without executing any of the subsequent logic.
