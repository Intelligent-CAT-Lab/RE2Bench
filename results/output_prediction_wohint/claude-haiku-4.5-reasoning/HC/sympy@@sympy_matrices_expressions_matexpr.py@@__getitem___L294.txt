[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__getitem__` method with `key = [1, 2]`:

1. **First condition**: `if not isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(key, slice):`
   - `key` is a list `[1, 2]`, not a tuple
   - `not isinstance([1, 2], tuple)` = True
   - `isinstance([1, 2], slice)` = False
   - Overall: True AND False = False → skipped

2. **Second condition**: `if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2:`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], tuple)` = False → skipped

3. **Third condition**: `elif isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer)):`
   - `[1, 2]` is a list, not an integer type → skipped

4. **Fourth condition**: `elif isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr)):`
   - `[1, 2]` is not a Symbol or Expr → skipped

5. **Final statement**: `raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)`
   - This line is reached

When the code tries to execute `'Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self` where `self = {}`:
- The `%` operator with a dict on the right side expects named format specifiers (like `%(name)s`)
- Since `%s` is a positional specifier and the right operand is a dict, this raises a `TypeError`
- Error message: "not all arguments converted during string formatting"

Therefore, a `TypeError` is raised during the attempt to construct the error message, before the `IndexError` can be raised.
