[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_mask_nc` with the given input:

1. The function is called with `eq = "sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1"` (a string), and `name = None`

2. In the function:
   - `name = name or 'mask'` → `name = 'mask'`
   - `numbered_names()` generator is created
   - A local `Dummy` function is defined
   - `expr = eq` → `expr` is assigned the string: `sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)") ) + 1`

3. The next line attempts to execute: `if expr.is_commutative:`
   - Here's the problem: `expr` is a Python string object
   - Strings do not have an `.is_commutative` attribute
   - This will raise an `AttributeError`

The function expects `eq` to be a SymPy expression object (which has properties like `.is_commutative`, `.is_Symbol`, `.is_Add`, etc.), but it receives a string instead. This causes the function to fail immediately when trying to access the attribute.

```
{
    "error": "AttributeError",
    "message": "'str' object has no attribute 'is_commutative'"
