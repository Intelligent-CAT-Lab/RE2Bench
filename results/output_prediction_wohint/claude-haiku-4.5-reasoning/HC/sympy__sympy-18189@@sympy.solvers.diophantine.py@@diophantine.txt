# Analysis

Looking at the execution of `diophantine` with input `eq = "8*x*y + z**2"`:

## Tracing the execution:

1. The equation is parsed as a SymPy expression: `8*x*y + z**2` (assuming string-to-sympy conversion)

2. Variables are extracted: `var = [x, y, z]` (sorted)

3. Classification via `classify_diop`:
   - `total_degree = 2` (max sum of exponents: xy has degree 2, z² has degree 2)
   - `len(var) = 3` (three variables)
   - `homogeneous = True` (no constant term)
   - This matches the condition for `'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'`

4. Since the equation type is `'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'` (not `'general_sum_of_squares'`), a `TypeError` is raised in the try block and caught

5. The code then calls `factor_list(8*x*y + z**2)[1]` to get `terms = [(8*x*y + z**2, 1)]`

6. For solving the equation `8*x*y + z**2 = 0`:
   - The trivial solution always exists: `(0, 0, 0)` since `8(0)(0) + 0² = 0`
   - This is verified by the check: `eq.subs(zip(var, null))` where `null = (0, 0, 0)`

7. Since all permute flags are False and the solution contains integers, it's directly added to `final_soln`
