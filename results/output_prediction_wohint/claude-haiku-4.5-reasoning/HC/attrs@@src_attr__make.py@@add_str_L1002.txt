[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add_str` method:

1. The method `add_str` is called on a _ClassBuilder instance with cls name "Error"
2. The first line checks: `if not self._repr_added:`
3. From the `__init__` method, we can see that `self._repr_added = False` is initialized
4. There's no indication in the input that `_repr_added` has been set to True before calling `add_str()`
5. Since `_repr_added` is False, the condition `if not self._repr_added:` evaluates to True
6. When this condition is True, the method raises a ValueError with message: '__str__ can only be generated if a __repr__ exists.'

The method does not proceed to define or add the `__str__` method because the check fails first.
