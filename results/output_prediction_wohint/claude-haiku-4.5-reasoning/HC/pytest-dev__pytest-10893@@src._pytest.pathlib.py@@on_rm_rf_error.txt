[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `on_rm_rf_error` function with the given inputs:

Given:
- `func`: "<function unlink>" (a string)
- `path`: "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0/dir/foo.txt"
- `excinfo`: {} (an empty dictionary)
- `start_path`: "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0"

Execution:
1. First check: `if isinstance(excinfo, BaseException):`
   - `excinfo` is a dictionary ({}), not a BaseException instance
   - This evaluates to False

2. Goes to else block: `exc = excinfo[1]`
   - This attempts to access key `1` in an empty dictionary
   - Since the dictionary `{}` has no key `1`, this will raise a **KeyError**

The function never gets past this line to continue execution or return a boolean value. The KeyError is raised immediately when trying to access a non-existent key in the dictionary.

The expected type for `excinfo` according to the type hint is `Union[BaseException, Tuple[Type[BaseException], BaseException, Optional[types.TracebackType]]]`, but the input provides an empty dict, which causes the function to crash with a KeyError.
