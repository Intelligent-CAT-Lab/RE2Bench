[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add_repr` method execution:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self`: A `_ClassBuilder` instance for the `Concrete` class
   - `ns`: `None` (null in JSON)

2. First, it calls `_make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns)` with `ns=None`:
   - Since `ns is None`, the condition `if ns is None:` is True
   - This sets `cls_name_fragment = '{self.__class__.__qualname__.rsplit(">.", 1)[-1]}'`
   - The function generates a script string and a globs dictionary
   - Returns `(script, globs)` tuple

3. Back in `add_repr`:
   - An inner function `_attach_repr` is defined
   - A tuple `(script, globs, _attach_repr)` is appended to `self._script_snippets`
   - `self._repr_added` is set to `True`
   - The method returns `self` (enables method chaining)

4. The side effects are:
   - `_repr_added` attribute changes from False to True
   - A new entry is added to `_script_snippets` list

5. The return value is the `_ClassBuilder` instance itself with these modifications.

The key observable change is that `_repr_added` is set to `True` and a script snippet is appended to track the repr method generation.
