[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `to_polygons` method step by step with the given inputs:

1. Check if vertices is empty:
   - `len(self.vertices)` = 2, so not empty, continue

2. Transform check:
   - `transform` is None, so skip the `transform.frozen()` call

3. Main condition check:
   - `self.codes is None`: True (codes is None)
   - `(width == 0 or height == 0)`: True (both width and height are 0)
   - Combined with AND: True

   Enter this block:
   ```python
   vertices = self.vertices  # array([[ 80., 330.], [576., 330.]])
   ```

4. Closed only check:
   - `closed_only` is False, so skip this block

5. Transform is None check:
   - `transform` is None: True
   - Return: `[vertices]`

The return value is a list containing the vertices array:
```
[array([[ 80., 330.],
        [576., 330.]])]
```

In JSON representation, this is a list containing one 2D array (represented as nested list):

```
{
    "result": [
        [[80.0, 330.0], [576.0, 330.0]]
