[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `build_class` method step by step.

Looking at the method:
```python
def build_class(self):
    self._eval_snippets()
    if self._slots is True:
        cls = self._create_slots_class()
        self._cls.__attrs_base_of_slotted__ = weakref.ref(cls)
    else:
        cls = self._patch_original_class()
        if PY_3_10_PLUS:
            cls = abc.update_abstractmethods(cls)
    if getattr(cls, '__attrs_init_subclass__', None) and '__attrs_init_subclass__' not in cls.__dict__:
        cls.__attrs_init_subclass__()
    return cls
```

**Analysis of the input:**
The input provides only partial state information:
- `auto_attribs = false`
- `these = null` → implies `self._delete_attribs = True` (since `not bool(None) = True`)
- `has_custom_setattr = false`

**Critical missing information:**
The input does NOT provide:
- `self._cls` - the actual class being built/decorated
- `self._slots` - whether slots are used
- `self._script_snippets` - script snippets to evaluate
- `self._cls_dict` - dictionary of class methods/attributes
- Other necessary state attributes

**What can be simulated:**
1. `_eval_snippets()` would attempt to execute, though the content of `_script_snippets` is unknown
2. The method would check `if self._slots is True:` - but `_slots` value is not provided
3. Either the slotted class path or patch path would be taken
4. A class object would be returned

**Conclusion:**
Without knowing what `self._cls` actually is (the fundamental class being decorated), and without knowing whether `self._slots` is True or False (which determines which branch executes), the specific output cannot be determined from the provided input. The method certainly returns a class object, but which specific class and what its state is cannot be predicted from the incomplete information.
