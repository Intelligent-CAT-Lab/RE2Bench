[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_hstack` with the given input:

1. The method is called with `Xs = None` (null in JSON)
2. First check: `if self.sparse_output_:` → `False`, so we go to the `else` branch
3. In the else branch, the first line is:
   ```python
   Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
   ```
4. This list comprehension attempts to iterate over `Xs` using `for f in Xs`
5. Since `Xs` is `None`, Python cannot iterate over it
6. This raises a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`

The execution fails at this point before any further code can execute.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "error": "TypeError",
    "message": "'NoneType' object is not iterable",
    "cause": "Attempting to iterate over Xs which is None in the list comprehension"
}
```
