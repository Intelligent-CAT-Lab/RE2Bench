[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `_print_Pow` method with the given inputs:

1. The method is called with:
   - `expr` = sqrt(2), which in SymPy is `Pow(2, 1/2)` or `Pow(2, S.Half)`
   - `rational` = False
   - `self` is a StrPrinter instance

2. First line: `PREC = precedence(expr)` - gets the precedence of the Pow expression

3. Next, check the first condition: `if expr.exp is S.Half and (not rational):`
   - For sqrt(2), `expr.exp` (the exponent) is `S.Half` (which equals 1/2)
   - `rational` is False, so `(not rational)` = True
   - **This condition is TRUE**

4. Since the condition is true, the method immediately returns:
   ```python
   return 'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base)
   ```

5. For sqrt(2):
   - `expr.base` is 2
   - `self._print(2)` will return the string '2'
   - Therefore: `'sqrt(%s)' % '2'` = `'sqrt(2)'`

The method returns the string 'sqrt(2)'.
