[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_fit` method step by step:

**Step 1: Validate Data**
- `X` is validated as a sparse CSC matrix of shape (150, 10)
- `y` is validated as an array of 150 elements
- `n_features = 10`

**Step 2: Determine n_features_to_select**
- `self.n_features_to_select = 4` (Integral type)
- `n_features_to_select = 4`

**Step 3: Determine step value**
- `self.step = 0.1` which is between 0.0 and 1.0
- `step = int(max(1, 0.1 * 10)) = int(max(1, 1.0)) = 1`

**Step 4: Initialize arrays**
- `support_ = np.ones(10, dtype=bool)` → all True (10 features)
- `ranking_ = np.ones(10, dtype=int)` → all 1s

**Step 5: Check step_score**
- `step_score = None`, so no step tracking initialized

**Step 6: Main elimination loop** - `while np.sum(support_) > n_features_to_select`
- Loop iteration 1: 10 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 9 True
- Loop iteration 2: 9 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 8 True  
- Loop iteration 3: 8 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 7 True
- Loop iteration 4: 7 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 6 True
- Loop iteration 5: 6 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 5 True
- Loop iteration 6: 5 > 4 → eliminate 1 feature → 4 True
- Loop exits: 4 > 4 is False

In each iteration:
- `threshold = min(1, remaining_features - 4) = 1` (for remaining > 4)
- One feature with lowest importance (from `_get_feature_importances`) is eliminated
- That feature's ranking is incremented

**Step 7: Final fit**
- Clone estimator and fit on the 4 selected features
- Set `n_features_ = 4`
- Set `support_` and `ranking_` to their final state
- Return `self`

The method returns the RFE object with these attributes set. The exact features selected depend on SVC coefficient calculations (via `_get_feature_importances`).
