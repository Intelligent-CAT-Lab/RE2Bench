[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `match_submerged_margins` step by step:

1. **Initialize axsdone**: `axsdone = []` - starts as an empty list

2. **Process subfigures**: The loop `for sfig in fig.subfigs:` would iterate over any subfigures in the figure. Based on the input description `"<Figure size 1000x500 with 2 Axes>"`, there are no subfigures mentioned, so this loop doesn't execute and `axsdone` remains `[]`.

3. **Get axes to process**: 
   ```python
   axs = [a for a in fig.get_axes() if a.get_subplotspec() is not None and a.get_in_layout() and (a not in axsdone)]
   ```
   - The figure has 2 Axes
   - Both axes should have valid subplotspecs (they're created from GridSpec(1, 2))
   - Both should be in layout (get_in_layout() typically returns True)
   - Neither is in axsdone (which is empty)
   - So `axs` initially contains 2 axes

4. **Filter by gridspec**: For each axis in the loop:
   - Get its subplotspec: `ss1 = ax1.get_subplotspec()`
   - Check if its gridspec is in layoutgrids: `if ss1.get_gridspec() not in layoutgrids:`
   - Since `GridSpec(1, 2)` is present in the layoutgrids dictionary, both axes should have their gridspec in the dict
   - Neither axis gets removed

5. **Check colspan and rowspan**:
   - For a GridSpec(1, 2) layout with 2 separate axes: each axis spans 1 column and 1 row
   - `len(ss1.colspan) > 1` would be False (each axis spans 1 column)
   - `len(ss1.rowspan) > 1` would be False (each axis spans 1 row)  
   - No margin editing operations occur

6. **Return**: The function returns `axs`, which contains the 2 axes from the figure.
