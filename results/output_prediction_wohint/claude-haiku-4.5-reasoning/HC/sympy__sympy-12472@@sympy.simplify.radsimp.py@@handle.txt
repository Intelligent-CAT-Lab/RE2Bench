[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `handle` function with the input `expr = "1/(a - b)"` (which I'll treat as the SymPy expression 1/(a - b)):

1. **Extract numerator and denominator:**
   ```python
   n, d = fraction(expr)  # For 1/(a - b): n = 1, d = a - b
   ```

2. **Check first condition:**
   ```python
   if expr.is_Atom or (d.is_Atom and n.is_Atom):
   ```
   - `expr.is_Atom` = False (it's a division)
   - `d.is_Atom` = False (a - b is an Add, not an atom)
   - So this returns False

3. **Check if numerator is not atomic:**
   ```python
   elif not n.is_Atom:
   ```
   - `n = 1` is atomic, so this is False

4. **Check if numerator is not S.One:**
   ```python
   elif n is not S.One:
   ```
   - `n = 1 = S.One`, so this is False

5. **Check if denominator is a multiplication:**
   ```python
   elif d.is_Mul:
   ```
   - `d = a - b` is Add, not Mul, so this is False

6. **Check various conditions before while loop:**
   - `symbolic = True` (default), so `not symbolic` is False
   - `ispow2(d)` is False (a - b is not a power)
   - `d.is_Add` is True, so `not (d.is_Add or ispow2(d))` is False

7. **Enter the while loop:**
   - `d = _mexpand(a - b)` → `a - b` (no change)
   - `d.is_Atom` is False
   - `d.is_number` is False
   
   **In the while loop's collection phase:**
   - For terms in `a - b` (which are `a` and `-b`):
   - Both terms have no power-of-2 factors, so `p2 = []`
   - All factors go into `other`
   - `collected[tuple()] = [a, -b]`
   
   **Convert to rterms:**
   - `rterms = [(1, a + (-b))]` = `[(1, a - b)]`
   
   **Calculate nrad:**
   - `nrad = 1 - 1 = 0` (since there's only one term with coefficient 1)
   - Since `nrad < 1`, we `break`

8. **Final return statement:**
   ```python
   if not keep:  # keep is True, so skip this
   return _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d)  # Returns _unevaluated_Mul(1, 1/(a - b))
   ```

The function returns `_unevaluated_Mul(1, 1 / (a - b))`, which represents the expression 1/(a - b).
