[THOUGHT]
The `get_weight()` method is very straightforward:

```python
def get_weight(self):
    return self._weight
```

It simply returns the `_weight` attribute of the object.

From the input, we can see that `self._weight` is set to `"normal"`.

Therefore, when `get_weight()` is called on this object, it will return the value of `self._weight`, which is `"normal"`.

{
    "return_value": "normal"
}
