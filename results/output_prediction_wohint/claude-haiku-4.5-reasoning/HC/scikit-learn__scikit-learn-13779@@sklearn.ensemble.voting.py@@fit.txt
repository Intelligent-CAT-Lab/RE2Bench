[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `fit` method:

1. The method receives:
   - `self.estimators = null` (None)
   - `self.weights = null` (None)
   - `self.n_jobs = null` (None)
   - `X` = feature data
   - `y` = target labels
   - `sample_weight = null` (None)

2. The first check in the `fit` method is:
   ```python
   if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
       raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')
   ```

3. Since `self.estimators is None` evaluates to `True`, the condition is satisfied and an `AttributeError` is raised immediately.

4. The error message is: `'Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples'`

5. The method terminates with an exception before any other processing occurs.
