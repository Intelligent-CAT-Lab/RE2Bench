[THOUGHT]
The function signature is `_osborne(e, d)` with two required parameters.

Looking at the input provided:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "e": "-\"sinh(x)\" + \"cosh(x)\"*tanh(x)"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

The input only provides one argument `e` in the args dictionary. The parameter `d` is completely missing from both args and kwargs.

When `_osborne(e, d)` is called with only `e` (and no `d`), Python will immediately raise a TypeError because `d` is a required positional argument with no default value.

The function would fail before even attempting to parse the expression string or execute any of the transformation logic.

```
{
    "error": "TypeError: _osborne() missing 1 required positional argument: 'd'"
}
