[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_repr_html_()` step by step:

1. `_repr_html_()` calls `self._repr_png_()` on the first line
2. Inside `_repr_png_()`:
   ```python
   if not self._isinit:
       self._init()
   ```
   
3. According to the input, `self._isinit = false` (Python: `False`)
4. Therefore, `not self._isinit` evaluates to `not False` = `True`
5. This means the condition is satisfied, so `self._init()` is called

6. Looking at the `_init()` method:
   ```python
   def _init(self):
       raise NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')
   ```

7. This method immediately raises a `NotImplementedError` exception

Since `_isinit` is `False`, the code path will attempt to initialize the object by calling `_init()`, which is defined as an abstract method that raises `NotImplementedError`. The function will never reach the rest of its code and will terminate with an exception.

The provided functions list does not include an override of `_init()`, only the abstract implementation that raises an error.
