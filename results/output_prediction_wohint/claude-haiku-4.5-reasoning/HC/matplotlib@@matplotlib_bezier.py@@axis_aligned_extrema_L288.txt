[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `axis_aligned_extrema` method step by step.

Given input:
- `self._N = 1` (number of control points)
- `self._d = 2` (dimension)
- `self._cpoints = array([[ 0.        , -2.48451997]])` (1 control point, 2D)

Step 1: Calculate `n = self.degree`
```python
n = self.degree  # which is self._N - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
```
So `n = 0`.

Step 2: Check the condition `if n <= 1:`
```python
if n <= 1:
    return (np.array([]), np.array([]))
```

Since `n = 0` and the condition `0 <= 1` is True, the function immediately returns two empty numpy arrays without computing polynomial coefficients or roots.

This makes sense because with only 1 control point, we have a Bezier curve of degree 0, which represents a single point, not a curve. There are no extrema to find along a single point.

The return value is a tuple of two empty arrays:
- First array: empty array for dims (which dimensions have extrema)
- Second array: empty array for roots (the parameter values where extrema occur)

```
{
    "return": "(array([], dtype=float64), array([], dtype=float64))"
}
