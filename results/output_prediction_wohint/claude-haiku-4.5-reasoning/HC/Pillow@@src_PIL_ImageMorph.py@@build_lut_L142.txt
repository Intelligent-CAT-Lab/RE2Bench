[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the execution of `build_lut()` with the given input.

The function does the following:

1. **Calls `build_default_lut()`**: This initializes the LUT where:
   - `m = 1 << 4 = 16` (binary: 10000)
   - For each index i from 0 to `LUT_SIZE-1` (typically 512 for a 3x3 kernel = 2^9):
     - If `(i & 16) > 0` (bit 4 is set): `lut[i] = 1`
     - Otherwise: `lut[i] = 0`
   - The default LUT has 1 where the center pixel is set, 0 otherwise

2. **Parses the two patterns and generates permutations**:
   - Pattern 1: `"4:(... .1. .0.)->0"` 
     - After removing spaces: `"....1..0."` (positions 0-8)
     - Options: `"4"` (4-fold rotation)
     - Result: `0`
   
   - Pattern 2: `"4:(... .1. ..0)->0"`
     - After removing spaces: `"....1...0"` (position 4=1, position 8=0)
     - Options: `"4"` (4-fold rotation)  
     - Result: `0`

3. **For each pattern, `_pattern_permute()` is called**:
   - Each pattern with `"4"` in options generates 4 rotated variations
   - All variations maintain result=0
   - This produces ~8 total pattern variants

4. **Compiles patterns to regex**: Each pattern has `.` replaced with `[01]` to match either 0 or 1

5. **For each index i (0 to LUT_SIZE-1)**:
   - Converts i to 9-bit binary, reverses it
   - Checks if the binary representation matches any compiled pattern
   - If matched: `lut[i] = result` (which is 0 for all our patterns)
   - If not matched: keeps default value

6. **Returns the modified bytearray**

The patterns represent an erosion-like operation where center pixel is 1 but specific neighbors are 0. The output is a `bytearray` of length typically 512, where values are 0 or 1 depending on pattern matches.

The patterns encode erosion conditions where center pixel=1 and specific neighbors=0"
