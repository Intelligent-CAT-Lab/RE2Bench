[THOUGHT]
We run _find_reasonable_pivot on col = [-9, -10, -21] with iszerofunc = _iszero.

1. The function first converts col to a list (it already is).
2. It checks the special numeric branch:
   - "all elements are instances of (Float, Integer)" is True (they are Integers).
   - "any element is Float" is False (none are Float).
   So the Float-specific branch is skipped.
3. Initialize possible_zeros = [] and iterate over the column:
   - i=0, x = -9. Call iszerofunc(x) which returns x.is_zero for a SymPy Integer. For -9, is_zero is False.
   - Since is_zero == False, the function immediately returns (i, x, False, newly_determined), with newly_determined still [].
4. Therefore the returned tuple is (0, -9, False, []).

(Note: the pivot value is the original first entry -9; the boolean third element is False; newly_determined is an empty list.)
