[THOUGHT]
We call _mask_nc(eq="sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1", name=None).

1. name becomes 'mask'.
2. The code sets expr = eq, so expr is a Python str: "sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1".
3. Next the code checks expr.is_commutative. A Python str has no attribute is_commutative, so attempting to access expr.is_commutative raises an AttributeError.
4. The function does not catch this, so it will terminate with that exception.

Therefore the output is an AttributeError indicating that 'str' object has no attribute 'is_commutative'.
