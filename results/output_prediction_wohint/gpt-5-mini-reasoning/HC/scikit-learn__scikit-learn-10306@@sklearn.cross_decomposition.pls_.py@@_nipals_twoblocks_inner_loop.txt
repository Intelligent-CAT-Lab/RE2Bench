[THOUGHT]
We run _nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop with the provided X and Y.

1. Initialize:
   - y_score = first column of Y as column vector: [-0.85511537, -0.70878547, 0.26065014, 1.3032507]^T
   - x_weights_old = 0, ite = 1.

2. First loop iteration (mode='A'):
   - x_weights = (X^T @ y_score) / (y_score^T @ y_score).
     Computing X^T @ y_score ≈ [2.883252, 2.978339, 2.856963]^T.
     y_score^T y_score ≈ 3.0.
     => x_weights (unnormalized) ≈ [0.961084, 0.992779, 0.952321]^T.
   - Normalize x_weights by its Euclidean norm ≈ 1.678 → x_weights ≈ [0.5728, 0.5918, 0.5676]^T.
   - x_score = X @ x_weights ≈ [-1.3524, -1.2418, 0.3676, 2.2266]^T.
   - y_weights = (Y^T @ x_score) / (x_score^T @ x_score) ≈ [0.5949, 0.5937]^T.
   - norm_y_weights is True, so normalize y_weights to unit norm → y_weights ≈ [0.7078, 0.7064]^T.
   - y_score = Y @ y_weights ≈ [-1.2255, -0.9599, 0.3249, 1.8608]^T.
   - x_weights_diff = x_weights - x_weights_old = x_weights (since x_weights_old was 0). Its squared norm is ~2.816 > tol, so continue.
   - Set x_weights_old = x_weights and ite = 2.

3. Second iteration:
   - Recompute x_weights = (X^T @ y_score) / (y_score^T @ y_score) with the updated y_score.
     This yields x_weights (after normalization) ≈ [0.5739, 0.5925, 0.5656]^T.
   - x_score, y_weights, y_score recomputed and are very close to the previous ones (small changes).
   - Compute x_weights_diff between this and previous x_weights; squared norm ≈ 5.6e-6 which is still > tol (1e-6), so continue.
   - Set x_weights_old = x_weights and ite = 3.

4. Third iteration:
   - Another iteration produces only tiny changes; x_weights stabilizes to values essentially identical to the previous iteration within the tolerance.
   - The squared norm of x_weights_diff falls below tol, so the loop breaks and returns the current (x_weights, y_weights, ite).
   - The algorithm converges after 3 iterations (ite == 3).

Final returned values (approximate):
- x_weights ≈ [[0.5739], [0.5925], [0.5656]]
- y_weights ≈ [[0.7078], [0.7064]]
- ite = 3
