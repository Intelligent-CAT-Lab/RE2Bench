[THOUGHT]
We call Artist.__init_subclass__ with cls being the subclass TestArtist.

Step 1: Check hasattr(cls.draw, '_supports_rasterization').
- If the subclass did not explicitly set a _supports_rasterization attribute on its draw function (very likely), this is False.
- So cls.draw is replaced by _prevent_rasterization(cls.draw). The wrapper returned by _prevent_rasterization has attribute _supports_rasterization = False. So after this step, cls.draw is the wrapped function.

Step 2: Check hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature').
- The typical case is that cls.set is inherited from Artist.set and does not have the attribute _autogenerated_signature (that attribute is only added by _update_set_signature_and_docstring when it has been run previously).
- Therefore hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature') is False, so the method immediately returns (implicitly returning None).
- No further changes (cls.set remains unchanged).

Return value: None (implicit).

Side effects: cls.draw has been wrapped by _prevent_rasterization (so it now has _supports_rasterization = False). cls.set is unchanged.

Final result: the function returns None.
