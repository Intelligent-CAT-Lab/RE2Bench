[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate _ClassBuilder.add_order.

- add_order does:
  cd = self._cls_dict
  cd['__lt__'], cd['__le__'], cd['__gt__'], cd['__ge__'] = (self._add_method_dunders(meth) for meth in _make_order(self._cls, self._attrs))
  return self

- _make_order(self._cls, self._attrs) returns four function objects (__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__) that compare tuples of the instance's ordered attributes. Those functions are then passed through self._add_method_dunders (which merely sets __module__/__qualname__/__doc__ on the function) and assigned into the class dict self._cls_dict under the corresponding names.

- Finally add_order returns self (the instance), after having inserted the four comparison methods into its _cls_dict.

Given the provided input, the method returns the same self object (now with the side effect of having set the comparison callables in its _cls_dict). The visible return value is the self object itself.

(We represent the returned object as the same mapping provided for self.)
