[THOUGHT]
- create_method is defined to take (name, method) and return a new function manager_method.
- The @wraps(method) decorator will try to copy metadata from `method`. Passing a dict as `method` does not raise here: attribute lookup on the dict instance will fall back to its class attributes, so wraps succeeds (it will copy whatever attributes it can).
- The returned object is the function manager_method. Its behavior: when called as manager_method(self, *args, **kwargs) it will execute and return getattr(self.get_queryset(), "values_list")(*args, **kwargs).
- So the output is the newly created function (manager_method) described above.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "return": "function manager_method(self, *args, **kwargs) -> return getattr(self.get_queryset(), 'values_list')(*args, **kwargs)"
}
```
