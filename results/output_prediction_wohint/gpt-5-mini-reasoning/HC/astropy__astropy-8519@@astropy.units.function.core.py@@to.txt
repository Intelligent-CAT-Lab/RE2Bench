[THOUGHT]
We follow FunctionUnitBase.to step by step with the given inputs.

1. The method starts with:
   if other is self.physical_unit:
       return self.to_physical(value)

   The supplied "other" object has the same unit-like contents as self._physical_unit. The intent of the code is to check identity; given the input representation they match conceptually, so this branch applies: the function returns self.to_physical(value).

2. We must therefore evaluate self.to_physical("2.5"). The snippet does not show to_physical implementation, but a reasonable interpretation for a FunctionUnitBase is:
   - coerce the input "2.5" (string) to a numeric 2.5, and
   - apply the function-unit scale to get a physical-unit value.

   The provided self._function_unit has _scale = -2.0, which corresponds to a multiplier of 10**(-2) = 0.01. Applying that to 2.5 yields 2.5 * 0.01 = 0.025.

3. Therefore the to() call returns 0.025 (a numeric physical-unit value).

So the predicted returned value is 0.025.
