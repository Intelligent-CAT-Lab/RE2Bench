[THOUGHT]
- The function checks if data is an instance of np.ndarray. Here data is a string "masked_array(...)", so that branch is skipped.
- Next, it checks if n_components > 1 and len(data) == n_components; n_components == 1, so this is skipped.
- Then it checks if n_components == 1; this is true, so the function returns data unchanged.
- Therefore the output is the same string that was passed in.

    "return": "masked_array(data=[1., 2.],\n             mask=False,\n       fill_value=1e+20)"
