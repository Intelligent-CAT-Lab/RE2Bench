[THOUGHT]
We call FeatureUnion.fit_transform with transformer_list entries that are strings (not estimator objects).

1. fit_transform checks routing; routing is disabled (default), so it builds routed_params as a Bunch for each transformer name. This does not raise.
2. fit_transform calls self._parallel_func(...). Inside _parallel_func the first steps are:
   - convert transformer_list to a list (no change),
   - call _validate_transformers().
3. _validate_transformers iterates over the transformers (the values from transformer_list). For each transformer t it checks:
   - if t is 'drop' or 'passthrough' -> not the case.
   - then it requires (hasattr(t, 'fit') or hasattr(t, 'fit_transform')) and hasattr(t, 'transform').
     Here t is a Python str like "SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')". A str has none of those attributes, so the condition fails and _validate_transformers raises a TypeError with message:
   "All estimators should implement fit and transform. '%s' (type %s) doesn't" % (t, type(t))

Filling in t and its type yields the exact error message:
All estimators should implement fit and transform. 'SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')' (type <class 'str'>) doesn't

Therefore fit_transform raises that TypeError and does not return a transformed array.
