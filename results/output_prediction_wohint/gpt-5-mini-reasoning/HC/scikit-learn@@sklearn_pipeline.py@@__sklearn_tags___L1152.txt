[THOUGHT]
1. Call Pipeline.__sklearn_tags__:
   - It first calls super().__sklearn_tags__(), which (per the provided function) returns:
     Tags(
       estimator_type=None,
       target_tags=TargetTags(required=False),
       transformer_tags=None,
       regressor_tags=None,
       classifier_tags=None,
     )
     I'll call this "tags".

2. Since self.steps is non-empty, the method enters the first try block:
   - It checks self.steps[0][1] which is the string "KernelPCA(...)" — not None and not 'passthrough'.
   - It attempts to call get_tags(self.steps[0][1]) where the estimator is a str.
   - get_tags tries to call estimator.__sklearn_tags__(), but a str has no such attribute, raising AttributeError.
   - get_tags detects the AttributeError and raises a new AttributeError with a descriptive message.
   - That AttributeError is caught by the Pipeline.__sklearn_tags__ first try's except (ValueError, AttributeError, TypeError), so the code in that try block is skipped and no changes are made to tags.

   - The comprehension used to set tags.input_tags.sparse would also call get_tags on the string steps and similarly raise, but that is inside the same try and thus also skipped due to the caught exception.

3. Next, the second try block attempts to inspect the last step (a string "Perceptron(...)"):
   - It calls get_tags on the string, which again raises AttributeError as above.
   - This AttributeError is caught by the second try's except and the block is skipped, so no changes are made to tags.

4. No modifications were applied to the tags returned by super().__sklearn_tags__(), so the method returns that original Tags object.

Therefore the returned tags correspond to the base Tags structure provided: estimator_type = None, target_tags = TargetTags(required=False), transformer_tags = None, regressor_tags = None, classifier_tags = None.
