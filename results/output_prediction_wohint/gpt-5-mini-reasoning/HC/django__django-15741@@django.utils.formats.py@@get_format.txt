[THOUGHT]
We call get_format("jS \\o\\f F", use_l10n=None).

1. use_l10n is None, so code attempts to set use_l10n = settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL. That yields a bound method (truthy), so the subsequent "if use_l10n and lang is None" branch runs. get_language() is called and returns settings.LANGUAGE_CODE (e.g. "en-us"), so lang becomes that value. None of this changes format_type.

2. format_type is converted to a string (remains "jS \\o\\f F"). The cache lookup in _format_cache misses (cache empty), so val is None.

3. Because use_l10n is truthy, the code iterates format modules looking for an attribute named exactly "jS \\o\\f F". Attribute names must be valid identifiers and no module will have such an attribute, so getattr(module, format_type, None) returns None for all modules and val stays None.

4. Since val is still None, the code checks whether format_type is in FORMAT_SETTINGS. "jS \\o\\f F" is not in FORMAT_SETTINGS, so the function returns format_type unchanged.

Therefore the return value is the same string passed in: "jS \\o\\f F".
