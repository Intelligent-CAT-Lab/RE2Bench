[THOUGHT]
We call sympify(a="2500/pi", strict=True).

- The function first checks various special attributes and converters; none apply to a plain Python string.
- The code uses iterable() imported from .compatibility. In SymPy's implementation, iterable(...) treats strings as non-iterable for sympify purposes, so the "if iterable(a):" branch that would try to sympify each element is not taken for a string.
- The code falls through to the string-handling branch where it prepares parsing transformations (including convert_xor/rationalize as requested).
- It calls parse_expr on "2500/pi" (after removing newlines). parse_expr parses the mathematical expression and returns the SymPy expression representing 2500 divided by pi.
- sympify returns that SymPy expression object.

So the return value is the sympy expression 2500/pi (i.e., 2500 * pi**(-1)).
