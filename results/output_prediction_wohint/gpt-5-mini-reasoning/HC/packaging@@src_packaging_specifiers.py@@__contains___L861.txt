[THOUGHT]
We call SpecifierSet.__contains__, which delegates to contains(item).

1. item is Version('1.0a1'); _coerce_version will return that Version instance. It is a prerelease (is_prerelease == True).
2. installed is None, so the "installed" branch doesn't set prereleases.
3. contains calls self.filter([version], prereleases=None).
4. Inside filter:
   - prereleases is None, but self._prereleases is True (given), so prereleases becomes True.
   - self._specs is empty (the input "frozenset()" represents an empty frozenset), so we go to the else branch.
   - In that branch, prereleases is True, so filter returns an iterator over the original iterable (i.e., yields the given version).
5. Back in contains, list(self.filter(...)) is a non-empty list (contains the version), so bool(...) is True.
6. Therefore __contains__ returns True.
