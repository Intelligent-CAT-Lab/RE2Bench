[THOUGHT]
We simulate match_submerged_margins with the provided inputs.

- Start with axsdone = [].
- The fig string "<Figure size 1000x500 with 2 Axes>" indicates there are no subfigs given in the input, so the initial recursion over fig.subfigs does nothing.
- axs is computed from fig.get_axes(). With a figure that has 2 Axes and no axes listed in axsdone, and assuming both axes have a non-None SubplotSpec and are marked in-layout, both axes are included in axs.
- For each ax1 in axs, the code checks whether its SubplotSpec's gridspec is present in layoutgrids. The provided layoutgrids contains an entry for "GridSpec(1, 2)", so the axes' gridspecs are found and lg1 is obtained.
- The rest of the code only modifies margins for axes spanning multiple columns/rows (colspan or rowspan length > 1). In the usual 1x2 configuration with two axes each occupying a single column/row, colspan and rowspan lengths are 1, so none of the margin-editing blocks run.
- No axes are removed from axs during iteration in this scenario, and no edits result in removing or skipping them.
- The function returns the list axs containing the two Axes.

Therefore the output is the list of the two Axes objects. Representing them by their usual string-like repr, we return two Axes placeholders.
