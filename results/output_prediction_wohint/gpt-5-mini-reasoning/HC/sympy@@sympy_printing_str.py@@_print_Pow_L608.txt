[THOUGHT]
We simulate StrPrinter._print_Pow with expr representing sqrt(2) (a Pow with exp == S.Half and base == 2) and rational=False.

1. PREC = precedence(expr) — computed but not used because the first conditional matches.
2. The method checks if expr.exp is S.Half and not rational. That is true.
3. It returns 'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base). The base is 2, so self._print(expr.base) yields '2'.
4. Final returned string is 'sqrt(2)'.
