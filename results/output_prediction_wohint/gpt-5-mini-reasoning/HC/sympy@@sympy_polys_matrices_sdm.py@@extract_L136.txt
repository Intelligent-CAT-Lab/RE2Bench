[THOUGHT]
We call SDM.extract with self being an (empty) SDM-like mapping and rows=[0,1,2], cols=[0].

- The method starts with: if not (self and rows and cols): return self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)
- Here self is empty (no keys), so "self and rows and cols" is falsy. Therefore it returns self.zeros((3, 1), self.domain).
- zeros constructs and returns SDM({}, shape=(3,1), domain="ZZ"). As a dict subclass with no elements, its printed representation is {}. The instance also has attributes shape=(3,1), rows=3, cols=1, domain="ZZ", but the object itself (its dict contents) is empty.

Thus the returned value is an empty SDM (empty dict) corresponding to a 3x1 zero sparse matrix.
