[THOUGHT]
We run dup_zz_factor with f = [1] and K = "ZZ".

1. The code first checks if GROUND_TYPES == 'flint'. We assume it's not, so we go to the regular branch.
2. Call dup_primitive(f, K).
   - f is non-empty ([1]), so dup_primitive computes the content. The content of [1] is 1.
   - Since the content is 1, dup_primitive returns (cont, f) = (1, [1]).
   - So cont = 1 and g = [1].
3. n = dup_degree(g) = len([1]) - 1 = 0.
4. dup_LC(g, K) = g[0] = 1 which is not < 0, so no sign change.
5. Since n <= 0 (n == 0), the function returns (cont, []) i.e. (1, []).

Therefore the function returns the tuple (1, []).
