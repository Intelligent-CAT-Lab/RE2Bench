We call _ClassBuilder.add_hash(self).

1. add_hash calls _make_hash_script(self._cls, self._attrs, frozen=self._frozen, cache_hash=self._cache_hash).

   - We are not given self._cls, self._attrs, self._frozen or self._cache_hash in the input. The code of _make_hash_script builds a script string and a globs dict based on the attrs list and whether cache_hash is enabled.
   - The most straightforward assumption (given no attrs provided) is that self._attrs is empty, so no attribute names are included in the hash computation. Also assume cache_hash is False (the typical default unless hash-caching was explicitly enabled).
   - With an empty attrs list and cache_hash == False, _make_hash_script will produce a function script equivalent to:

        def __hash__(self):
            return hash((
                    <type_hash>,
                ))

     where <type_hash> is an integer computed internally (hash(_generate_unique_filename(cls, "hash"))). The globs dict will be empty ({}), since there are no eq_key functions to capture.

2. add_hash then defines attach_hash(locs) which sets self._cls_dict['__hash__'] = self._add_method_dunders(locs['__hash__']).

3. add_hash appends the tuple (script, globs, attach_hash) to self._script_snippets.

4. add_hash returns self (the _ClassBuilder instance).

So the observable result is that the same _ClassBuilder object is returned, and its _script_snippets list has one additional entry: a tuple containing the generated script string (as above, with an implementation that returns hash of a tuple containing the computed type_hash), an empty globs dict, and the attach_hash callable.

Because the exact integer value of type_hash depends on internal state not provided, I show it as a placeholder {type_hash} in the script below.
