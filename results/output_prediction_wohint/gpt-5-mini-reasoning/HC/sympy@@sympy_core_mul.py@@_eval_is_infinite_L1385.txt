[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Mul._eval_is_infinite for self = pi/2.

1. _eval_is_infinite calls _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper().
2. In the helper: seen_zero = seen_infinite = False initially.
3. Iterate over self.args. For the argument pi/2:
   - a.is_zero is False (pi/2 is not zero), so the first if/elif are skipped.
   - a.is_zero is not None, so the branch that would set seen_zero = None is not taken.
   - a.is_infinite is False (pi/2 is finite), so the branch that would set seen_infinite = None is not taken.
   - No flags change; after the loop the helper returns (False, False).
4. Back in _eval_is_infinite: seen_infinite is False, so the function returns False.

Hence the output is the boolean False.
