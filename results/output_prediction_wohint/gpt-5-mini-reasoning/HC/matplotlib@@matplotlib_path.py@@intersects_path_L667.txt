[THOUGHT]
intersects_path simply calls _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled).

self describes a path with two vertices: (0,0) -> (2,0) (a horizontal segment along the x-axis).
other describes a path with two vertices: (0,0) -> (1.99969539, -0.03490481) (a segment starting at the same point (0,0) and going slightly below the x-axis).

These two segments share the endpoint (0,0), so they intersect at that point. Therefore _path.path_intersects_path(...) should return True (filled=True does not change the fact they intersect at the shared endpoint).
