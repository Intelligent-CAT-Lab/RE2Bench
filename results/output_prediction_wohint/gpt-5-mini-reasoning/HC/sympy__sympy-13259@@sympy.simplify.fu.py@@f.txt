[THOUGHT]
We have f = _osbornei(e, d) returning a closure f(rv). The body of f:

- First checks if not isinstance(rv, TrigonometricFunction): if so, return rv unchanged.
- Otherwise it would transform trig functions; but that branch isn't reached here.

The provided rv is the expression "_Dummy_163*x" (not a TrigonometricFunction), so the isinstance check fails and f simply returns the input unchanged.

```
{
    "return": "_Dummy_163*x"
}
