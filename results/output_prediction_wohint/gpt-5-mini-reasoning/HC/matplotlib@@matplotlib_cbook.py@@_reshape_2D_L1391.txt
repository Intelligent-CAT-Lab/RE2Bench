- The function calls _unpack_to_numpy(X). X is a plain Python str, so _unpack_to_numpy returns it unchanged (not a numpy array).
- _reshape_2D then sees X is not an ndarray. len(X) != 0, so it proceeds to iterate over X.
- Iterating over a string yields single-character strings. For each character xi:
  - isinstance(xi, str) is True, so is_1d remains True.
  - xi = np.asanyarray(xi) produces a 0-d numpy array holding that single-character string.
  - xi.reshape(-1) yields a 1-D numpy array of length 1 containing the character, which is appended to result.
- After the loop, result is a list of 1-D numpy arrays, each holding one character from the original string. Since is_1d is True, the function returns [np.reshape(result, -1)].
- np.reshape(result, -1) converts the list of 1-element numpy arrays into a 1-D numpy array of characters equal to list(original_string).
- Therefore the function returns a list containing a single numpy array whose elements are each character of the input string (including brackets, digits, commas, spaces, and newline characters). In JSON form this is represented as a list containing a list of single-character strings (newline represented as "\n").
