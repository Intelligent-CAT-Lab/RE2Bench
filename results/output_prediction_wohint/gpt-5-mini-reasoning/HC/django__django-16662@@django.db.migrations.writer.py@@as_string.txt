[THOUGHT]
We run MigrationWriter.as_string with a migration that has no operations and include_header=False.

Key steps:
- The loop over self.migration.operations produces no operations (treating operations as empty), so items['operations'] ends up as ''.
- No dependencies are provided, so items['dependencies'] is ''.
- imports starts empty; code ensures at least 'from django.db import migrations' is present, so items['imports'] becomes "from django.db import migrations\n".
- include_header is False so items['migration_header'] is ''.
- Filling the MIGRATION_TEMPLATE with these items yields a module string that contains the imports, a class Migration with empty dependencies and empty operations lists.

The exact produced string (with newline characters) is:
"from django.db import migrations\n\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n    dependencies = [\n    ]\n\n    operations = [\n    ]\n"
