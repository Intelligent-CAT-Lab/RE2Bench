[THOUGHT]
1. The fit method starts by checking: if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0: ...
2. In the input, self["estimators"] is null (i.e. None). Therefore the condition is true.
3. The method raises an AttributeError with the message:
   "Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples"
4. No further code is executed.
