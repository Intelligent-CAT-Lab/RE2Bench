[THOUGHT]
We execute Kernel.__eq__(self, b).

1. The method first checks if type(self) != type(b). In the provided input, "self" is an object with attributes (a kernel-like mapping) while "b" is the string "RBF(length_scale=1)". Their types are different (object vs. string), so the check fails.

2. Because the types differ, the method immediately returns False without comparing parameters.
