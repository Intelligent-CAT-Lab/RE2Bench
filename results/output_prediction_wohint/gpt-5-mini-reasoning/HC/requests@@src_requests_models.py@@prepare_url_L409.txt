[THOUGHT]
We run PreparedRequest.prepare_url with url="http://localhost:49515/" and params={}.

1. url is a str, so url = str(url) -> "http://localhost:49515/".
2. url = url.lstrip() -> still "http://localhost:49515/".
3. The check if ':' in url and not url.lower().startswith('http') is false because url starts with "http".
4. parse_url(url) splits into components:
   - scheme = "http"
   - auth = None
   - host = "localhost"
   - port = 49515
   - path = "/"
   - query = "" or None (empty)
   - fragment = "" or None (empty)
5. scheme is present and host is present, and host is ASCII.
6. netloc built: auth or '' -> '' so netloc = '' then netloc += host -> "localhost", port present -> netloc = "localhost:49515".
7. path is "/", so it remains "/".
8. params is a dict {}, so _encode_params(params) produces an empty string (no encoded params). enc_params is falsy, so query remains unchanged (empty).
9. urlunparse([...]) yields "http://localhost:49515/".
10. requote_uri keeps it the same.
11. self.url is set to "http://localhost:49515/".
12. The method has no return statement, so it returns None. The observable effect is that self.url is now "http://localhost:49515/".

The relevant output value is the updated self.url.
