[THOUGHT]
1. add_repr is called with ns = None.
2. It calls _make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns). We don't need the exact script/globs contents here; _make_repr_script will return a (script, globs) tuple based on self._attrs and ns.
3. add_repr then defines an inner function _attach_repr that will set '__repr__' in a class dictionary to the result of self._add_method_dunders(globs['__repr__']).
4. add_repr appends the tuple (script, globs, _attach_repr) to self._script_snippets.
5. It sets self._repr_added = True.
6. Finally, add_repr returns self (the same _ClassBuilder instance).
7. The input represents that instance as "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>", so the returned value is that same representation.

No exceptions or other return values occur.
