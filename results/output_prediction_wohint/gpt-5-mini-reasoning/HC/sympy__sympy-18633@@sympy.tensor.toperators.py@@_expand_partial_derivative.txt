[THOUGHT]
We execute PartialDerivative._expand_partial_derivative(self).

1. The method begins by evaluating:
   args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)

2. To get self.expr it uses the property:
   def expr(self):
       return self.args[0]

   so it needs self.args to exist.

3. The provided self only has _indices, _free, _dum (all null) and no .args attribute or _args initialized. Attempting to access self.args raises an AttributeError.

Therefore the call fails immediately with an AttributeError complaining that the PartialDerivative instance has no attribute 'args'.
