[THOUGHT]
We call collect(expr=_Dummy_373, syms=None, func=None, evaluate=True, exact=False, distribute_order_term=True).

1. sympify(expr) makes expr into the SymPy symbol _Dummy_373.
2. syms is None. The code treats syms as a single-element list [None] and goes through the nonsyms handling, which ultimately results in calling collect recursively with the original expression and with a placeholder symbol; substituting back has no effect on the expression.
3. There is nothing to collect in a single Symbol, so the routine accumulates the "disliked" (uncollected) part as the symbol itself and no collected parts are created.
4. With evaluate=True the function returns Add(*[key * val for key, val in collected.items()]) which in this case reduces to the original symbol _Dummy_373.

Therefore the function returns the same symbol _Dummy_373.
