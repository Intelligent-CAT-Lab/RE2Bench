[THOUGHT]
We treat self = "-phi" as the Mul instance representing -1*phi, so self.args is (-1, phi).

Start with sign = 1.

Iteration 1: t = -1
- -1.is_extended_negative is True, so sign = -sign -> sign becomes -1.
- Continue loop.

Iteration 2: t = phi
- phi has no definite sign attributes (is_extended_positive/negative, is_zero, is_extended_nonpositive/nonnegative are unknown).
- is_positive is not False (it's None), is_negative is not False (None).
- The code reaches the final else branch and does "return" with no value, so the function returns None.

Therefore the function returns None (JSON null).
