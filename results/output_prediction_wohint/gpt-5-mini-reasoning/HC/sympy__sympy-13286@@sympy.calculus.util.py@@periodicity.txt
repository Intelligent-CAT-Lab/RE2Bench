[THOUGHT]
We call periodicity(f, symbol, check=False) with f = csc(2*x) - sec(x). (The symbol argument is not shown in the input but must be x for the function to operate; I proceed with symbol = x.)

1. orig_f = f. f is simplified (no change) to csc(2*x) - sec(x).
2. f.free_symbols contains x, so we continue.
3. f is an Add (csc(2*x) + (-sec(x))). In the is_Add branch:
   - as_independent(symbol) yields k = 0 and g = f (no constant term).
   - So the code calls _periodicity on the addends (the arguments).
4. Consider the individual trig terms:
   - For csc(2*x): TrigonometricFunction._period with general_period = 2*pi inspects argument 2*x. Because argument is a Mul with factor 2 times x, the period is general_period / abs(2) = (2*pi)/2 = pi.
   - For sec(x): sec has general_period = 2*pi and argument x, so its period is 2*pi.
5. The combined function csc(2*x) - sec(x) will have a period that is a common period of {pi, 2*pi}, i.e. the least common multiple of the individual periods, which is 2*pi.
6. check is False, so periodicity returns that period object directly.

Therefore the function returns 2*pi.
