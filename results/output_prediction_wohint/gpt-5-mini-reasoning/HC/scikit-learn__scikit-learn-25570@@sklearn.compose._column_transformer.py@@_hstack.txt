[THOUGHT]
We call _hstack(self, Xs=None).

1. Check if self.sparse_output_ is True. It's False, so take the else branch.
2. The code executes:
   Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
   This attempts to iterate over Xs.
3. Since Xs is None, iterating over it raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
4. Therefore the function does not return a value; it raises a TypeError with that message.

No further lines are executed because of the exception.
