[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate _parallel_poly_from_expr given exprs = ["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"] and an empty opt.

1. The function sees len(exprs) == 2 but the two elements are strings (not Poly instances), so it proceeds with the general path.
2. It sympifies both inputs:
   - sympify("2") -> Integer(2)
   - sympify("-1*2*cos(phi)") -> -2*cos(phi)
3. Neither sympified expression is a Poly, so both are treated as generic expressions. They are collected into exprs = [2, -2*cos(phi)].
4. _parallel_dict_from_expr is called with these two expressions and opt. That helper will determine a common set of generators (symbols) and produce "reps": a list of dictionary representations for each expression in a (monomial -> coefficient) form. For these inputs:
   - The symbol present is phi, so gens will be set to (phi,)
   - The coefficients (for the single monomial, the constant monomial) are 2 and -2*cos(phi)
   - construct_domain will choose a domain able to represent these coefficients; because cos(phi) is a non-polynomial expression the domain used will be the generic expression domain (EX) and coefficients will be treated as EX elements
5. After getting reps and the updated opt (with gens populated and domain set), the function collects monom tuples and corresponding coefficient lists, and then for each expression creates a Poly object from the dict representation using Poly._from_dict(rep, opt).
   - The first Poly corresponds to the constant 2 over generator phi: Poly(2, phi, domain='EX')
   - The second Poly corresponds to the constant (in monomial sense) -2*cos(phi): Poly(-2*cos(phi), phi, domain='EX')
6. opt.polys is set according to whether any original inputs were Poly instances; here none were, so opt.polys will be False (or at least not True).
7. The function returns a tuple (polys, opt) where polys is a list of the two Poly objects and opt is the options object updated with gens and domain.

Representing the Poly objects as their usual string forms and opt as a dict-like view, the returned value is:
- polys: ["Poly(2, phi, domain='EX')", "Poly(-2*cos(phi), phi, domain='EX')"]
- opt: contains gens ["phi"], domain "EX", and polys False
