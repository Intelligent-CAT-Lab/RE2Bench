[THOUGHT]
We call Product._eval_product(self, term, limits).

1. The implementation starts with:
   k, a, n = limits

2. The provided limits is a list of two strings: ["u + v", "u - 1"].
   Unpacking three variables (k, a, n) from a 2-element list raises a ValueError.

So the function will raise a ValueError: "not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)".

No further code is executed.
