[THOUGHT]
1. sympify converts the input string "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)" into the SymPy expression 2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2).
2. The denominator has a common factor a**2: a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2 = a**2*(x**2 - y**2).
3. The quadratic difference x**2 - y**2 factors as (x - y)*(x + y).
4. factor_terms pulls out the common a**2 and factors the quadratic, yielding 2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y)).
5. There is no cancellation between numerator and denominator, so the final simplified/factored expression is 2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y)).
