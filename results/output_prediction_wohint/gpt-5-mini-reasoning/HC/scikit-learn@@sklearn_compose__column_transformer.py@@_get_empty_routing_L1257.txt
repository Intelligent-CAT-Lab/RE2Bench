[THOUGHT]
We call _get_empty_routing which builds a dict comprehension over the iterator self._iter(fitted=False, column_as_labels=False, skip_drop=True, skip_empty_columns=True).

Step through _iter:
- Since fitted is False, transformers is built by zipping self.transformers with self._columns:
  - self.transformers has one element ("trans", "Trans()", <lambda>), self._columns is [0].
  - After the comprehension transformers becomes [("trans", "Trans()", 0)].
- self._remainder is ["remainder", "drop", [1]] and self._remainder[2] is truthy, so transformers becomes an iterator that yields the above tuple and then the remainder triple.
- get_weight = (self.transformer_weights or {}).get — transformer_weights is null -> get_weight(name) will return None.

Iterating:
- First item: name="trans", trans="Trans()", columns=0.
  - skip_drop is True but trans != 'drop', so it is kept.
  - skip_empty_columns is True but columns=0 is not an empty selection, so it is kept.
  - column_as_labels is False so no remapping to feature names.
  - yield ("trans", "Trans()", 0, None).
- Second item: name="remainder", trans="drop", columns=[1].
  - skip_drop is True and trans == 'drop', so this item is skipped.

So the comprehension iterates over a single name "trans", and for that name builds Bunch(**{method: {} for method in METHODS}).

The result is a Bunch whose only attribute is "trans", and that attribute is itself a Bunch mapping every method in METHODS to an empty dict. Representing Bunch objects as plain nested dicts in JSON, the output is a mapping with key "trans" to a dict of method names each mapped to {}. (METHODS in sklearn is the set of metadata request method names; here we list the typical ones.)

Therefore the output contains a single top-level entry "trans" mapping to the methods, each with an empty dict.
