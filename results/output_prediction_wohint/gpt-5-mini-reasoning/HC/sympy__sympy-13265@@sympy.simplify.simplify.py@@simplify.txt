[THOUGHT]
We call simplify with the string:
("(\"exp(x)\" + \"exp(-x)\")/(y*(\"exp(x)\" - \"exp(-x)\"))")

1. simplify first calls sympify(expr). Since expr is a Python string literal that contains quoted substrings, sympify will end up using parse_expr which parses the expression; because there are explicit string literals in the expression, parse_expr will produce a plain Python string (the concatenation and arithmetic are parsed but operate on string literals, resulting in a string), not a SymPy Basic expression.

2. Back in simplify, expr is therefore not an instance of sympy.core.basic.Basic. The code then reaches:
   if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:
       return expr

   A plain Python string is not a Basic, so simplify returns the string unchanged.

Therefore the output is the same string that was passed in.
