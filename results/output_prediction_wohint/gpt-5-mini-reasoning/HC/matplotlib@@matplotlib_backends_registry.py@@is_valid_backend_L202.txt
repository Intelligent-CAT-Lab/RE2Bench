[THOUGHT]
1. Input backend is "Agg".
2. Since it doesn't start with "module://", the code lowercases it -> "agg".
3. The code checks if "agg" is in _BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK. That mapping contains 'agg': 'headless', so the condition is True.
4. The function returns True immediately (entry points are not loaded).
