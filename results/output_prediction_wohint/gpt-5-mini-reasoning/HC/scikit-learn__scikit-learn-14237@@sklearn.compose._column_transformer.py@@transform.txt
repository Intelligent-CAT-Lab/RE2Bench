[THOUGHT]
1. transform begins by calling check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_').
2. The provided self has "transformers_": null (None).
3. check_is_fitted checks that the attribute exists and is not None; since transformers_ is None it raises a NotFittedError indicating the estimator is not fitted yet.
4. Therefore transform does not proceed further and raises that exception.

{
    "exception": "NotFittedError(\"This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator.\")"
}
