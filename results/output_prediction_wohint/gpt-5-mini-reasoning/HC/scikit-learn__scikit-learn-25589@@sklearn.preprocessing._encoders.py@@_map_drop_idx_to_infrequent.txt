[THOUGHT]
We call _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx=1, drop_idx="0").

1. The method begins with:
   if not self._infrequent_enabled:
       return drop_idx
   In the provided self, _infrequent_enabled is False.

2. Because _infrequent_enabled is False, the method returns drop_idx unchanged.

3. The provided drop_idx is the string "0", so the returned value is "0".
