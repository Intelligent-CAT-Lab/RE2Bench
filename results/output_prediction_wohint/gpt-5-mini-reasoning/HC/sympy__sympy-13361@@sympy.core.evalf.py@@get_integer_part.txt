We call get_integer_part(expr=5*sqrt(42949673), no=1, return_ints=True).

1. evalf is called on 5*sqrt(42949673) with assumed_size=30, returning a high-precision floating approximation for the real part and no imaginary part. Compute sqrt(42949673):
   - 6553^2 = 42,941,809
   - 6554^2 = 42,954,916
   - 42949673 lies between those, so sqrt ≈ 6553.6000030518...
   - Multiply by 5 gives value ≈ 32768.000015259...
   So the exact numeric value is slightly greater than 32768.

2. In calc_part:
   - nint is initialized from the integer conversion of the evaluated mpf; that yields 32768.
   - Since the value is not an exact integer, expr - nint is a small positive remainder (~1.5e-5).
   - For no == 1, the code increments nint by 1 when the remainder is positive.
   - So nint becomes 32769.

3. imag part is absent -> treated as 0.

4. Because return_ints=True, the function returns the pair of ints (real_int, imag_int) = (32769, 0).

Therefore the output is the tuple (32769, 0).
