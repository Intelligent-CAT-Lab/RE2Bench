1. _get_kernel_params starts by assigning params = self.kernel_params. Here kernel_params is null -> params = None.
2. Since params is None, it is replaced with an empty dict: params = {}.
3. kernel is the string "polynomial", which is not callable and not equal to "precomputed", so we iterate over KERNEL_PARAMS["polynomial"] (expected to list the kernel-specific parameter names, e.g. ["gamma", "coef0", "degree"]).
4. For each param:
   - "gamma": getattr(self, "gamma") is None, so skip.
   - "coef0": getattr(self, "coef0") is 0.1, not None, so params["coef0"] = 0.1.
   - "degree": getattr(self, "degree") is 3.1, not None, so params["degree"] = 3.1.
5. No ValueError branch is taken. The method returns the params dict containing only the provided non-None kernel parameters.

Result: {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}
