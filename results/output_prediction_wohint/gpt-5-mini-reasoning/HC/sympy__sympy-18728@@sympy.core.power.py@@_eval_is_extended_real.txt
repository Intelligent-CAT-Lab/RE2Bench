[THOUGHT]
We call Pow._eval_is_extended_real(self) with self = {} (a plain dict) and no args.

- The method first does: real_b = self.base.is_extended_real
- Python will try to evaluate self.base. But self is a dict, so attribute access self.base raises AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'base'.
- Execution stops at that point with that AttributeError; no further lines in the method are executed.

Therefore the call raises an AttributeError with the message "'dict' object has no attribute 'base'".
