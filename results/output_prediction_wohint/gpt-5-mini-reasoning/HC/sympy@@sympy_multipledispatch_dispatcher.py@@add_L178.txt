[THOUGHT]
We call Dispatcher.add with:
- self = "<dispatched SymmetricHandler>" (dispatcher instance)
- signature = a sequence with one element: the MatAdd class
- func = some function
- on_ambiguity = ambiguity_warn

Step-by-step through add():
1. if not signature: — signature is non-empty, so skip.
2. if any(isinstance(typ, tuple) for typ in signature): — signature contains a single class, not a tuple, so this is False.
3. Loop over typ in signature: the single element is a class (MatAdd), so isinstance(typ, type) is True and no TypeError is raised here.
4. The code then does self.funcs[signature] = func. However, signature as given is a list (JSON array). Lists are unhashable and cannot be used as dict keys in Python. Attempting to use a list as a key raises a TypeError: "unhashable type: 'list'".

Therefore the method raises a TypeError at the point of setting the dict entry; it does not return normally.
