[THOUGHT]
We call _getitem_RepMatrix with key = [0, 0] (a list). The method first checks if key is a tuple; it's not, so it goes into the non-tuple branch.

1. It obtains rows, cols via self.shape — that uses self.rows and self.cols which are present (3, 3).
2. Next line in the function is rep = self._rep.rep. However, in the provided input self._rep is a string: "DomainMatrix(...)" (a Python str), not an object with a .rep attribute.
3. Accessing .rep on a str raises an AttributeError: "'str' object has no attribute 'rep'".
4. Therefore the function will not proceed further and raises that AttributeError.

No other exceptions or returns occur before this.
