[THOUGHT]
We call Term.mul with two Terms both having coeff=1 and empty numer/denom Factors.

Step-by-step:
- coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff -> 1 * 1 = 1.
- numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer). Both are empty Factors -> mul returns an empty Factors (no factors to combine).
- denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom). Similarly returns an empty Factors.
- numer, denom = numer.normal(denom). With both empty, normal returns the pair of empty Factors unchanged.
- Return Term(coeff, numer, denom) -> Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})).

So the result is a Term with coefficient 1 and empty numerator and denominator Factors.
