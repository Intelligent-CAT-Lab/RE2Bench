[THOUGHT]
1. to_polygons is called with self.codes == None, width == 0 and height == 0, and transform == None.
2. The code checks: if self.codes is None and (width == 0 or height == 0) — this is True (codes is None and width == 0).
3. It sets vertices = self.vertices, which is the 2×2 array:
   [[ 80., 330.],
    [576., 330.]]
4. closed_only is False, so no change to vertices.
5. transform is None, so the function returns [vertices] (a single-element list containing the vertex array).
6. Representing the array as nested lists, the return value is [[[80.0, 330.0], [576.0, 330.0]]].
