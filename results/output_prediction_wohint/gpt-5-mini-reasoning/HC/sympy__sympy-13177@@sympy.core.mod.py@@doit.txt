[THOUGHT]
We are to evaluate the nested function doit(p, q) with p = {} (an empty Python dict) and q = "5" (a Python string).

The function's first statement attempts to evaluate:
    if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
This requires attribute lookups p.is_infinite and q.is_infinite. For the given p (a dict), attribute access p.is_infinite will raise an AttributeError because dict objects do not have an attribute named is_infinite. There is no try/except around this check, so the AttributeError will propagate out of doit immediately. The function does not proceed further.

Therefore the result is an AttributeError: "'dict' object has no attribute 'is_infinite'".
