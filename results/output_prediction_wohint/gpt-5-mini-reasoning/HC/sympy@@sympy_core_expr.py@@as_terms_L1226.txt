[THOUGHT]
We execute Expr.as_terms on the expression "-w**2 - x**2 + y**2 + z**2".

1. Add.make_args(self) yields the four terms: -w**2, -x**2, y**2, z**2 (iteration order preserved here).
2. For each term:
   - Extract coefficient and remaining multiplicative part via as_coeff_Mul():
     - -w**2 and -x**2 are Mul(-1, w**2) and Mul(-1, x**2) so coeff = -1, _term = w**2 or x**2.
     - y**2 and z**2 are powers, so coeff = 1, _term = y**2 or z**2.
   - coeff_complex = complex(coeff) gives (-1+0j) or (1+0j).
   - For the non-number part (_term), iterate its Mul.make_args:
     - Each term is a single Pow factor like w**2, x**2, y**2, z**2.
     - factor.is_number is False, factor.is_commutative is True, so decompose_power yields base and exponent:
       - w**2 -> base w, exp 2
       - x**2 -> base x, exp 2
       - y**2 -> base y, exp 2
       - z**2 -> base z, exp 2
     - Populate cpart mapping base->exp and collect bases in gens_set.
   - No noncommutative parts, so ncpart is empty tuple.
   - coeff_tuple becomes (coeff_complex.real, coeff_complex.imag): (-1.0, 0.0) or (1.0, 0.0).
   - Each term is appended as (term, (coeff_tuple, cpart, ncpart_tuple)).

3. After processing terms, gens_set contains {w, x, y, z}. gens is sorted via default_sort_key; that yields [w, x, y, z] (alphabetical by symbol name).

4. Build monomial vectors of length 4 (k=4) in gens order [w,x,y,z]:
   - -w**2 -> monom = (2, 0, 0, 0)
   - -x**2 -> monom = (0, 2, 0, 0)
   - y**2  -> monom = (0, 0, 2, 0)
   - z**2  -> monom = (0, 0, 0, 2)

5. The function returns (result, gens) where result is a list of tuples (term, (coeff_tuple, monom_tuple, ncpart_tuple)).

So the returned structure (expressions shown as their string forms) is:

result list in the same term order [-w**2, -x**2, y**2, z**2], with coefficient tuples, monomial exponent tuples (w,x,y,z), and empty ncpart tuples; gens = [w, x, y, z].
