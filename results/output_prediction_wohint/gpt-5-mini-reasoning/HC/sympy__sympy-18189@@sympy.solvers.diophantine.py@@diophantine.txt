[THOUGHT]
We need integer solutions of 8*x*y + z**2 = 0.

Rewriting: z^2 = -8 x y. Because z^2 >= 0, the right-hand side must be >= 0, so x and y have opposite sign or one is zero.

A simple algebraic parametrization: choose integers s, t and set
  y = s^2,
  x = -2 t^2,
  z = 4 s t.

Check:
  8*x*y + z^2 = 8 * (-2 t^2) * (s^2) + (4 s t)^2
               = -16 s^2 t^2 + 16 s^2 t^2 = 0.

Because the equation is homogeneous of degree 2, a common integer factor k can be introduced as well:
  (x,y,z) = k * (-2 t^2, s^2, 4 s t)
but the (s,t) parametrization already generates integer solutions (and k can be absorbed by scaling s and/or t).

So diophantine will return a parametric family of solutions; a compact form is the set containing the tuple
  (-2*t**2, s**2, 4*s*t)
corresponding to (x, y, z) with integer parameters s, t.
