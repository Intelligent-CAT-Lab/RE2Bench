[THOUGHT]
- call_command is called with command_name="transaction" (a string), stdout provided, and no_color=True.
- The function first checks if command_name is an instance of BaseCommand. It is not, so it goes into the else branch and executes:
    try:
        app_name = get_commands()[command_name]
    except KeyError:
        raise CommandError('Unknown command: %r' % command_name)
- get_commands() builds a mapping of available command names to app labels based on find_commands over django.core.management.__path__[0]. Then, because settings.configured is not set/configured (LazySettings.configured returns False in this environment), get_commands() returns that mapping without inspecting INSTALLED_APPS.
- The provided environment does not guarantee that "transaction" is present in that mapping. The code path shown indicates that an unknown command results in a KeyError and immediately raises a CommandError with the message "Unknown command: 'transaction'".
- Therefore call_command will raise a CommandError with the message "Unknown command: 'transaction'".
