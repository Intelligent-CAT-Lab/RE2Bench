[THOUGHT]
The _read method enters an infinite loop reading one byte at a time from self.file. For each byte it:
- looks up and calls the handler self._dtable[byte](self, byte),
- raises if self._missing_font is set (it's None in the input),
- inspects the handler name to update down_stack on '_push', '_pop', '_down',
- possibly sets self._baseline_v if it is still None and len(self.stack) == 3 and down_stack[-1] >= 4,
- if the byte equals 140 it returns True,
- if self.state becomes _dvistate.post_post it closes the file and returns False.

Given the provided self:
- _missing_font is null, so no exception path is taken.
- self.state is outer (not post_post), so the post_post early-return path does not trigger.
- The file shown is a real .dvi file; DVI streams terminate with the byte value 140 (the post command in DVI), and the code explicitly returns True when byte == 140.

Therefore the loop will eventually read the terminating 140 byte and return True.
