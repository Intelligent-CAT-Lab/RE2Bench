We simulate Vlist.vpack with the provided self and arguments (h=0.0, m='additional', l=Infinity).

Initial local vars: w=0.0, d=0.0, x=0.0. total_stretch and total_shrink are lists of zeros.

We iterate over the 5 children. The two HCentered entries are clearly Box-like nodes with height=6.30, depth=0.00, width=5.96, shift_amount=0.00. The other three children ("Vbox", "Hrule", "Vbox") are not detailed; assuming they have zero height and zero depth (so they act like zero-sized Boxes). None of the children are Glue, Kern, or Char at the top level in the given representation.

Step through children:

1) First HCentered (Box):
- x += d + p.height = 0.0 + 6.30 = 6.30
- d = p.depth = 0.0
- w = max(0.0, 5.96 + 0.0) = 5.96

2) Vbox (assumed zero-sized Box):
- x += d + 0.0 = 6.30 (unchanged)
- d = 0.0
- w remains 5.96

3) Hrule (assumed zero-sized Box):
- x stays 6.30, d stays 0.0, w stays 5.96

4) Vbox (assumed zero-sized Box):
- x stays 6.30, d stays 0.0, w stays 5.96

5) Second HCentered (Box):
- x += d + 6.30 = 6.30 + 6.30 = 12.60
- d = 0.0
- w remains 5.96

After the loop:
- self.width = w = 5.96
- d (final depth) = 0.0 which is not greater than l=Infinity, so self.depth = 0.0

Since m == 'additional', h += x => h = 0.0 + 12.60 = 12.60
- self.height = h = 12.60

Compute x = h - x = 12.60 - 12.60 = 0.0
Since x == 0, set:
- self.glue_sign = 0
- self.glue_order = 0
- self.glue_ratio = 0.0

self.glue_set remains unchanged (initially 0.0).

The method returns None.

So the mutated fields of self are:
- width: 5.96
- height: 12.6
- depth: 0.0
- glue_sign: 0
- glue_order: 0
- glue_ratio: 0.0
- glue_set: 0.0

The function returns None.
