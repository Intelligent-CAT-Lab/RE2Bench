[THOUGHT]
We call ColumnTransformer.transform with the given self.

1. The first line in transform is:
   check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_')

2. check_is_fitted checks that the attribute exists and is not None. In the provided self, "transformers_" exists but is null (None).

3. Therefore check_is_fitted raises a NotFittedError with the default message:
   "This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator."

No further lines of transform run because the exception is raised immediately.

So the outcome is an exception (NotFittedError) with that message.
