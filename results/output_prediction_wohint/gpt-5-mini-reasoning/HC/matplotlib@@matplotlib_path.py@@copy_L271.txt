[THOUGHT]
copy.copy(self) performs a shallow copy of the Path instance and does not call __init__. The new object will have the same attributes and values as the original: _vertices, _codes, _interpolation_steps, _simplify_threshold, _should_simplify, and _readonly. No attributes are modified during copying.

```
{
    "_vertices": "array([[0., 0.],\n       [1., 1.]])",
    "_codes": "array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)",
    "_interpolation_steps": 1,
    "_simplify_threshold": 0.1111111111111111,
    "_should_simplify": false,
    "_readonly": false
}
