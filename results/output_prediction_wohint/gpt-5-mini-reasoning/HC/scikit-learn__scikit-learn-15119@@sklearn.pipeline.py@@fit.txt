[THOUGHT]
We call FeatureUnion.fit(self, X, y, **fit_params). Inside fit it calls self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one).

Entering _parallel_func:
- First line: self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)
- In the provided input, self.transformer_list is null -> None in Python.
- Calling list(None) raises TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

Thus execution fails immediately with that TypeError; no further lines are executed and no value is returned from fit.
