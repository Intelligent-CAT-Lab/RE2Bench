[THOUGHT]
The function _osborne is defined as _osborne(e, d) and requires two positional arguments. The provided call supplies only e (a string) and no d. Therefore Python will raise a TypeError before the function body runs, complaining that the required positional argument 'd' is missing.
[/THOUGHT]
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "error": "TypeError: _osborne() missing 1 required positional argument: 'd'"
}
```
