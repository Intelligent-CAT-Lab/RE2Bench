[THOUGHT]
We call Mul.as_ordered_factors on the product w*z with order=None.

1. as_ordered_factors does: cpart, ncpart = self.args_cnc().
2. args_cnc treats the Mul as a list of factors. Both w and z are commutative symbols, so it returns cpart = [w, z], ncpart = [].
3. It then sorts cpart with key expr.sort_key(order=None). With the default sort_key, symbols are ordered lexicographically by name, and 'w' comes before 'z', so the order remains [w, z].
4. The method returns cpart + ncpart, i.e. [w, z].

So the output is the list of factors ["w", "z"].
