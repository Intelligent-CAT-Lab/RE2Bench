[THOUGHT]
We simulate Dispatcher.register being called with a single type argument.

- The method register(self, *types, **kwargs) defines an inner function _ (a decorator):
    def _(func):
        self.add(types, func, **kwargs)
        return func
  and then returns that inner function.

- No further action is taken at this point (self.add is only called when the returned decorator is used on a function). So the immediate return value is the inner decorator function object.

Therefore the output is a function object representing Dispatcher.register.<locals>._ (the decorator).
