[THOUGHT]
1. transform calls check_is_fitted(self). Given self has a classes_ attribute, this check will pass (no exception).
2. _build_cache sees _cached_dict is None and sets it to dict(zip(self.classes_, range(len(self.classes_)))). But classes_ is the string "array([0, 1, 2])", so the mapping is built over characters of that string. The final mapping has 12 distinct character keys (characters like 'a','r','y','(', '[', '0', ',', ' ', '1', '2', ']', ')') mapped to indices 0..15 with later duplicates overwriting earlier ones; the resulting dict length is 12.
3. _transform iterates over the 25 rows in y. Each label is a string like "np.int64(1)". None of those label strings are keys in the character-based class_mapping, so every label lookup raises KeyError and those labels are collected into unknown. For every row, the per-row index set remains empty, so indices stays empty and indptr grows with repeated zeros.
4. After processing all 25 rows, indices is empty (length 0), indptr is a list/array of 26 zeros (initial 0 plus one appended per row), and data = np.ones(len(indices)) is an empty array.
5. The CSR matrix constructed has shape (len(indptr)-1, len(class_mapping)) = (25, 12) and contains all zeros (no stored ones). Since sparse_output is False, transform converts the sparse matrix to a dense numpy array.
6. The final returned value is a 25x12 numpy array of zeros.

So the output is a 25-row by 12-column array of zeros.
