[THOUGHT]
1. resolve_gui_or_backend receives gui_or_backend = "no-such-name".
2. It lower-cases the name (no change): "no-such-name".
3. Calls backend_for_gui_framework("no-such-name") — the internal GUI->backend map does not contain this key, so it returns None.
4. It then calls resolve_backend("no-such-name").
   - resolve_backend lower-cases the name (still "no-such-name").
   - Checks built-in backends and self._backend_to_gui_framework (empty) — no match, so gui = None.
   - Since _loaded_entry_points is False, it calls _ensure_entry_points_loaded(), which reads entry points and validates/stores them. With no relevant entry points found, no backend mappings are added, and _loaded_entry_points becomes True.
   - After loading entry points, there is still no mapping for "no-such-name", so resolve_backend raises RuntimeError("'no-such-name' is not a recognised backend name").
5. resolve_gui_or_backend catches that exception and raises a new RuntimeError with the message "'no-such-name' is not a recognised GUI loop or backend name".

So the call raises a RuntimeError with that message.
