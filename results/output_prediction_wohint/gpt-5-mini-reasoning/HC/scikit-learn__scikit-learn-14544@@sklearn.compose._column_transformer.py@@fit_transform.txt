[THOUGHT]
1. fit_transform starts by checking hasattr(X, 'columns'). The provided X object has keys like "_mgr" etc but no "columns" attribute, so hasattr(X, 'columns') is False. Thus self._feature_names_in is set to None (overwriting the prior value).
2. Next X = _check_X(X). The implementation of _check_X is not provided; assume it returns X unmodified or at least does not raise here.
3. _validate_transformers is called. It checks "if not self.transformers: return". In the input self.transformers is null (None), so "not self.transformers" is True and _validate_transformers returns without error.
4. _validate_column_callables is called next. Its code iterates "for _, _, column in self.transformers:". Since self.transformers is None, attempting to iterate over it raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
5. Therefore fit_transform does not complete normally; it raises a TypeError with that message.

The function call raises a TypeError("'NoneType' object is not iterable").
