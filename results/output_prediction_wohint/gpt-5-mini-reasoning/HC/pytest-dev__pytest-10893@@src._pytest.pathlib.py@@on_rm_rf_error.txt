[THOUGHT]
The function starts by checking if excinfo is an instance of BaseException. The provided excinfo is an empty dict ({}), so that check is False. The code then executes the else branch and tries to do exc = excinfo[1]. Indexing an empty dict with key 1 raises a KeyError. No try/except in the function catches this, so the KeyError propagates out of on_rm_rf_error. The function does not return a normal value.
