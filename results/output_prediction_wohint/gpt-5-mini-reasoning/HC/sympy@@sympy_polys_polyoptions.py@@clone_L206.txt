[THOUGHT]
- clone creates a new empty instance of the same class: obj = dict.__new__(self.__class__).
- It then copies items from self.items(); since self is empty, nothing is copied.
- It then applies updates: sets obj['gens'] = ["cos(phi)"].
- The returned object is a dict-like instance containing a single key "gens" with the provided list value.

```
{
    "gens": [
        "cos(phi)"
    ]
}
