[THOUGHT]
- mktemp sets sharex/sharey: inputs sharex=False, sharey=False. The code converts non-str False -> 'none' for both.
- _api.check_in_list accepts 'none' (it's in the allowed list), so no error.
- subplot_kw is None -> becomes an empty dict copied.
- axarr = np.empty((1, 1), dtype=object) creates a 1x1 object array.
- Loop runs once for row=0, col=0:
  - shared_with mapping yields 'none' -> None for both sharex and sharey, so subplot_kw['sharex']=None and subplot_kw['sharey']=None.
  - self[row, col] produces a SubplotSpec for the single cell (row=0,col=0).
  - figure.add_subplot(self[row, col], **subplot_kw) creates and returns a new Axes for that SubplotSpec.
  - axarr[0, 0] is set to that Axes instance.
- After the loops, squeeze is True and axarr.size == 1, so subplots() returns the single Axes object (not an array).
- The returned object is an Axes instance; its common string representation is like "<AxesSubplot(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)>".

Therefore the function returns the newly created Axes object; represented here by its typical repr string.
