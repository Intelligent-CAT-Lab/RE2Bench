[THOUGHT]
We execute _BinMapper.fit with the provided inputs.

1. Validate n_bins: n_bins = 11, which is between 3 and 256, so no error.
2. X is passed to check_array with ensure_all_finite=False; assume it is accepted and returns a numpy array with shape (1000000, 2).
3. max_bins = n_bins - 1 = 10.
4. random_state = 42 → rng becomes a numpy RandomState seeded with 42.
5. subsample = 200000 and X has 1_000_000 rows, so subsampling occurs:
   - rng.choice selects 200000 row indices (deterministic given seed 42) and X is reduced to those rows.
6. is_categorical is None so:
   - self.is_categorical_ becomes an array of zeros of length n_features = 2: [0, 0] (dtype uint8).
   - known_categories defaults to [None, None].
7. Both features are non-categorical, so _find_binning_thresholds is called (in parallel) for each of the two columns with max_bins = 10. The implementation of _find_binning_thresholds is not provided here, so we cannot compute exact threshold numeric values. However, we can determine the shapes that fit produces:
   - For each non-categorical feature, bin_thresholds_[f_idx] will be a 1-d array of thresholds. Let T_f be its length; then n_bins_non_missing[f_idx] = T_f + 1.
   - Typical behavior for histogram binning with max_bins=10 is to produce 10 thresholds, resulting in 11 non-missing bins. With continuous-valued data (as here), it's reasonable that each thresholds array has length 10 and thus n_bins_non_missing becomes 11 for each feature.
8. The method sets:
   - self.missing_values_bin_idx_ = n_bins - 1 = 10
   - self.bin_thresholds_ = [thresholds_for_feature0, thresholds_for_feature1]
   - self.n_bins_non_missing_ = np.array([11, 11], dtype=np.uint32) (assuming each thresholds array has length 10)
9. fit returns self.

Because the exact numeric threshold arrays depend on _find_binning_thresholds and the sampled data and that function's implementation (not provided), we cannot provide the concrete threshold values. We can, however, provide the concrete attributes whose values are deterministic from the inputs: is_categorical_, missing_values_bin_idx_, and the lengths of the computed bins.

Therefore the function returns the same estimator object (self) with the following new/updated attributes (bin threshold arrays are indicated symbolically because numeric values are not determinable from the given information).
