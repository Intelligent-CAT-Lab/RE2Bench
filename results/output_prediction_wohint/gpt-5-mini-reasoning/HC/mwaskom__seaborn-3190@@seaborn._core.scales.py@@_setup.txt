[THOUGHT]
1. The method starts with new = copy(self). Given "self" is represented as a mapping, copy(self) yields a shallow copy (a dict).
2. Next statement is: if new._tick_params is None:
   - This attempts attribute access new._tick_params on the copied object.
   - But new is a dict, and dicts do not support attribute access for keys; trying to access an attribute on a dict will raise an AttributeError.
3. Therefore execution stops immediately with an AttributeError: "'dict' object has no attribute '_tick_params'".
No further code is executed.
