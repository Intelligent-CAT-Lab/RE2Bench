[THOUGHT]
We call MatrixExpr.__getitem__(self, key) with key = [1, 2] (a list).

Step through the code:
1. First branch: if not isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(key, slice): key is a list, not a slice -> False.
2. Second branch: if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2: key is a list, not a tuple -> False.
3. Third branch: elif isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer)): key is a list -> False.
4. Fourth branch: elif isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr)): key is a list -> False.
5. None of the cases match, so the final statement is executed:
   raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)

The IndexError is raised with the message formed by inserting self into the format string. Given the input representation of self is {}, the message becomes "Invalid index, wanted {}[i,j]".

So the function raises an IndexError with that message.
