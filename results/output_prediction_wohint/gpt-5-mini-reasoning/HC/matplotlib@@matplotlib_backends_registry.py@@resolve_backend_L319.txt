[THOUGHT]
1. resolve_backend is called with backend="agg" (a str). It lowercases it -> "agg".
2. It looks up GUI framework: first checks _BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK.get("agg"), which exists and equals "headless".
3. Since gui == "headless", the function will return (backend, None) (it maps "headless" to None in the return).
4. No entry-point loading or module importing is needed because the builtin mapping already provided the GUI.
So the result is the tuple ("agg", None).
