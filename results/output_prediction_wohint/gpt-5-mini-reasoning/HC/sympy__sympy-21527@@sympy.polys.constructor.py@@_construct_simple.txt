[THOUGHT]
We call _construct_simple(coeffs=None, opt={}). Execution steps:

1. The function starts and sets local flags and float_numbers = [].
2. It then evaluates "if opt.extension is True:". Here opt is a dict ({}), so accessing opt.extension tries to read an attribute on a dict.
3. In Python this raises an AttributeError: "'dict' object has no attribute 'extension'".
4. Therefore the function does not proceed further and an AttributeError is raised.

So the output is an AttributeError with that message.
