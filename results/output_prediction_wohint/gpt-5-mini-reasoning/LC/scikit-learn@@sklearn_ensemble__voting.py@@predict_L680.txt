[THOUGHT]
1. predict calls check_is_fitted(self). The VotingRegressor instance has an attribute ending with underscore: estimators_, so check_is_fitted will pass (estimator is considered fitted).
2. predict then calls self._predict(X).
3. _predict does: np.asarray([est.predict(X) for est in self.estimators_]).T
4. self.estimators_ (from input) is a list of strings (representations of pipelines), not actual estimator objects. The comprehension takes the first element, which is a str, and tries to call its predict attribute.
5. A Python str has no attribute 'predict', so an AttributeError is raised: "'str' object has no attribute 'predict'".
6. The exception propagates out of predict; no numpy averaging is reached.

So the function raises an AttributeError with that message.

  "exception": {
    "name": "AttributeError",
    "message": "'str' object has no attribute 'predict'"
