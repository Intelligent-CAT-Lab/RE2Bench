[THOUGHT]
- x.__name__ -> "ImaginaryUnit"
- y.__name__ -> "Pi"
- names differ.
- issubclass(y, Basic) is True (Pi is a SymPy Basic subclass), so continue.
- ordering_of_classes lookup for both names raises ValueError, so both get UNKNOWN.
- both UNKNOWN -> use lexicographic comparison of names:
  "ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi", so (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2) = 0 - 1 = -1.
- Function returns -1.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "return": -1
}
```
