[THOUGHT]
We call add_book on a BookManagement instance whose inventory is {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}, with title="book2" and no quantity (uses default quantity=1).

Step-by-step:
1. The method checks if "book2" is in self.inventory — it is.
2. It increments self.inventory["book2"] by quantity (1): 1 + 1 = 2.
3. The method does not have a return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the method updates inventory to {"book1": 2, "book2": 2} and returns None. The function's return value is None.
