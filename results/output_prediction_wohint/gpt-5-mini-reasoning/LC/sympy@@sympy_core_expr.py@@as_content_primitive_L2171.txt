[THOUGHT]
We call Expr.as_content_primitive(self, radical=False, clear=False).
The method body is: return (S.One, self).
So the result is a 2-tuple whose first element is S.One and second element is the same object passed as self.
The provided self has attribute "nargs" with value "{1}", so the returned tuple is (S.One, <self object with nargs="{1}">).
I'll represent S.One as the string "S.One" and the self object by its given dictionary representation.

{
    "return": [
        "S.One",
        {
            "nargs": "{1}"
        }
    ]
}
