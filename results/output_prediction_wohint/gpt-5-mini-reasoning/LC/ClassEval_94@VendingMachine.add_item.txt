[THOUGHT]
We call add_item with item_name "Coke", price 1.25, quantity 10.

1. add_item calls self.restock_item("Coke", 10).
2. restock_item checks if "Coke" is in inventory — it is.
3. It increments inventory["Coke"]["quantity"] from 20 to 30 and returns True.
4. Back in add_item, the condition is "if not True", which is False, so the body that would create a new entry is not executed.
5. add_item has no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null).

Note: the inventory is mutated so "Coke" now has quantity 30, but the function's return value is None.
