[THOUGHT]
We call SubplotSpec.get_topmost_subplotspec().

1. get_topmost_subplotspec calls self.get_gridspec().
2. get_gridspec returns self._gridspec, which in the input is the string "GridSpec(1, 1)".
3. The method then checks hasattr(gridspec, 'get_topmost_subplotspec'). gridspec is a plain string, which does not have that attribute.
4. Therefore the method returns self (the SubplotSpec instance) unchanged.

So the returned value is the same object passed as self, with its attributes unchanged.
