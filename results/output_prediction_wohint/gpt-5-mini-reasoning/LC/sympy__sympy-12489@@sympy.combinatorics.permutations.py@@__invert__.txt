[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Permutation.__invert__(self).

The method body is:
    return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))

Evaluation order for a function call evaluates the function expression first, i.e. it tries to look up self._af_new. The provided self has attributes "_array_form": None and "_size": 5 but does not provide any attribute named "_af_new". The class defined in the snippet does not define _af_new either, so attribute lookup on self for "_af_new" fails immediately, raising an AttributeError. The code never reaches evaluating _af_invert(...) because the lookup of self._af_new raises first.

Therefore the call raises an AttributeError: the object has no attribute '_af_new'.
