[THOUGHT]
The program reads one line from input: the JSON field value is "\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\"", i.e. the literal characters: a double quote, avrnc, a comma, fwujpcm, a comma, ggjmc, and a closing double quote.

The code does input().replace(',', ' '), so each comma is replaced by a space. That transforms:
"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
into:
"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"

print outputs that exact string (including the surrounding double quotes).

[OUTPUT]
```
"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"
