[THOUGHT]
We need to follow Model.__eq__:

1. Check "if not isinstance(other, Model): return NotImplemented".
   - The provided "other" has the same structure/fields as "self" (both have _state, id, headline, pub_date), so we assume isinstance(other, Model) is True.

2. Check "if self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model: return False".
   - No _meta is provided in the input, but both objects represent the same model type in the given context, so we assume their _meta.concrete_model values are equal and this check passes.

3. Compute "my_pk = self.pk".
   - pk is a property that calls _get_pk_val, which does "meta = meta or self._meta" and then "return getattr(self, meta.pk.attname)".
   - Assuming the model's primary key attname is "id", getattr(self, "id") yields 1. So my_pk = 1.

4. "if my_pk is None: return self is other" — not the case (my_pk == 1).

5. "return my_pk == other.pk".
   - other.pk similarly resolves to other.id == 1, so comparison yields True.

Therefore the equality check returns True.
