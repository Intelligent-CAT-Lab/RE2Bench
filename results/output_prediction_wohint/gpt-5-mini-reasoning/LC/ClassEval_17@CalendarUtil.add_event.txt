[THOUGHT]
We call CalendarUtil.add_event with a self whose events list already contains one event dict. The add_event method does:
- self.events.append(event)
- there is no return statement, so the function returns None (Python implicit).

Side effect: self.events will now contain the original event plus the appended event (two identical dicts). The function's return value is None, which in JSON is null.
