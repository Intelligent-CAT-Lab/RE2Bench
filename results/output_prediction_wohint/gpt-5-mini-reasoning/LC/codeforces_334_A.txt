[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads a single line input "8" and converts it to integer n = 8.
2. It sets i = 1 and j = n * n = 64.
3. The while loop runs while i < j. Each iteration prints "i j", then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
4. Starting from (i, j) = (1, 64), the loop continues until i >= j. For k iterations, i = 1+k and j = 64-k. The loop condition 1+k < 64-k holds while k <= 31. For k = 0..31 inclusive, we print pairs:
   (1,64), (2,63), ..., (32,33).
5. After printing (32,33) the next step would make i = 33 and j = 32, at which point i < j is false and the loop stops.

So the output is 32 lines, each line "i j" for i from 1 to 32 and j from 64 down to 33.
