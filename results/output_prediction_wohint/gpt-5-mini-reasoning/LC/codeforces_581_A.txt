[THOUGHT]
The input string is "\"1 1\"" in the JSON, which represents the actual console input: 1 1
- input() -> "1 1"
- x = list(input().split()) -> ['1', '1']
- convert to ints -> x = [1, 1]
- a = 1, b = 1
- print(min(x), end=' ') prints "1 " (min of [1,1] is 1)
- abs(a - b) = 0, which is not >= 2, so the else branch prints "0"

Combined output is:
1 0
