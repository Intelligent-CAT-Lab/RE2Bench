[THOUGHT]
The program reads one line into stdin. The provided input value is "\"BBA\"" which is a string consisting of a double quote, B, B, A, double quote: '"BBA"'.

s becomes '"BBA"'. The condition checks whether both 'A' and 'B' are substrings of s.
- 'A' is in s (the A inside).
- 'B' is in s (there are two B characters).

Both are present, so result = 'Yes'. The program prints Yes.
