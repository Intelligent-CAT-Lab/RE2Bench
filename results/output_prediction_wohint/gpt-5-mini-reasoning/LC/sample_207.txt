[THOUGHT]
We execute f(commands) step by step.

1. Initialize d = {}.
2. Iterate over commands list:
   - First c = {"brown": 2}; d.update(c) -> d becomes {"brown": 2}.
   - Next c = {"blue": 5}; d.update(c) -> d becomes {"brown": 2, "blue": 5}.
   - Next c = {"bright": 4}; d.update(c) -> d becomes {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}.
3. Return d, which is {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}.
