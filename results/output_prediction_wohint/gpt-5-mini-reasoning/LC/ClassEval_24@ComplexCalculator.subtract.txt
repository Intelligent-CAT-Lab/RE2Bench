[THOUGHT]
- The static method subtract expects c1 and c2 to have .real and .imag attributes (i.e., complex numbers).
- Provided inputs are strings: "(-1+2j)" and "(-3+4j)".
- Attempting to access c1.real will raise an AttributeError because Python str objects do not have a 'real' attribute.
- The function will therefore raise AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real' before any subtraction or return occurs.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real'"
}
