[THOUGHT]
We evaluate: return other.__class__ is self.__class__ and other.object_id == self.object_id and (other.generation == self.generation)

Given self = {} (a dict) and other = [1, 2] (a list):
- other.__class__ is self.__class__ becomes list is dict → False.
- Python's and short-circuits, so the rest is not evaluated.
- The expression evaluates to False.
