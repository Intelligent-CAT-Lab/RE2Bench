[THOUGHT]
We evaluate auto_set_mode with current_temperature = 25 and target_temperature = 25.
The condition checks if current_temperature < target_temperature. 25 < 25 is False, so the else branch runs and sets self.mode = 'cool' (it is already 'cool').
The method has no return statement, so it returns None.
