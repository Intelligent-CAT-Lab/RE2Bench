[THOUGHT]
1. dup_l1_norm receives f = [1, 2] and K = "ZZ" (we treat K as the integer domain object ZZ with methods zero, abs, and sum).
2. Check if not f: f is non-empty, so proceed to the else branch.
3. Call dup_abs(f, K): this returns [K.abs(1), K.abs(2)] -> [1, 2] (absolute values).
4. Call K.sum([1, 2]): Domain.sum does sum(args, start=self.zero). K.zero is 0, so sum([1,2], start=0) = 3.
5. dup_l1_norm returns 3.
