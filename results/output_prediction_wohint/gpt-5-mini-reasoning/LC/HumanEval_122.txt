[THOUGHT]
We call add_elements(arr, k) with arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and k = 4.

1. Compute arr[:k] -> [111, 21, 3, 4000].
2. For each element in that slice, include it in the sum only if len(str(elem)) <= 2:
   - 111 -> str('111') length 3 -> excluded
   - 21  -> str('21') length 2 -> included
   - 3   -> str('3') length 1 -> included
   - 4000-> str('4000') length 4 -> excluded
3. Sum of included elements = 21 + 3 = 24.

The function returns 24.
