[THOUGHT]
The setup function calls app.add_transform several times but does not return values from those calls. It then returns the ExtensionMetadata dictionary {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}. The app argument is provided but its behavior doesn't change the returned dict.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "return": {
        "version": "builtin",
        "parallel_read_safe": true,
        "parallel_write_safe": true
    }
}
```
