[THOUGHT]
1. Call any_int(2, 1, 1).
2. Check isinstance for all: isinstance(2,int), isinstance(1,int), isinstance(1,int) => all True.
3. Evaluate sums:
   - x + y = 2 + 1 = 3, compare to z (1) => 3 == 1 is False.
   - x + z = 2 + 1 = 3, compare to y (1) => 3 == 1 is False.
   - y + z = 1 + 1 = 2, compare to x (2) => 2 == 2 is True.
4. Since one condition is True, the function returns True.
