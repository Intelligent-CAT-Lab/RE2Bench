[THOUGHT]
We call add_argument(self, arg="age", required=False, arg_type=<class 'int'>).

1. The method checks `if required:` — since required is False, it does not add anything to self.required. self.required remains the empty set.
2. It then executes `self.types[arg] = arg_type`, setting self.types["age"] to the provided arg_type. The existing types mapping already has "age": int, so this overwrites it with the same value (no effective change).
3. The method has no return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the function's return value is None. (Self is mutated as described, but the output of the call is None.)
