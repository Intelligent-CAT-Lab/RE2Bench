[THOUGHT]
The setup function does two things:
1. Calls app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader) and app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor). Given the provided app ("<SphinxTestApp buildername='html'>"), these calls register the two transforms on the app (side effects), but they don't affect the return value.
2. Returns the extension metadata dictionary: {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}.

There are no conditional branches or other computations; the returned dict is exactly as written in the function.

  "return": {
    "version": "builtin",
