[THOUGHT]
The function checks whether the list is equal to its sorted version (ascending) or its sorted version in reverse (descending).

1. Input list l = [9, 9, 9, 9].
2. sorted(l) -> [9, 9, 9, 9], which is equal to l.
3. Since l == sorted(l) is True, the function returns True (it doesn't need to check the reverse case).

So the result is True.
