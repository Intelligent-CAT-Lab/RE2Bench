[THOUGHT]
1. loads constructs a TimestampSigner and calls unsign_object on the provided string.
2. The signed string has three colon-separated parts: payload, timestamp, signature.
   - payload = "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9"
   - timestamp = "1u7SIo"
   - signature = "wF3XgnVXy3Uny-ff_G2pL1VcbThKPy56l3Vn9gnoLso"
3. The payload is base64 for the JSON bytes. Decoding "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9" yields the JSON string '{"a":"dictionary"}'.
4. Assuming the signature verifies successfully, unsign_object deserializes that JSON and returns the Python dict {"a": "dictionary"}.
5. Therefore loads(...) returns the dictionary {"a": "dictionary"}.
