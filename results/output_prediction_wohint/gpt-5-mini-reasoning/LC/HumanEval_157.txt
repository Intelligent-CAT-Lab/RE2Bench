[THOUGHT]
We evaluate right_angle_triangle(10, 6, 8).

1. Compute squares: a*a = 10*10 = 100, b*b = 6*6 = 36, c*c = 8*8 = 64.
2. Check the first condition: a*a == b*b + c*c -> 100 == 36 + 64 -> 100 == 100 -> True.
3. Since the first part of the OR expression is True, the overall function returns True.
