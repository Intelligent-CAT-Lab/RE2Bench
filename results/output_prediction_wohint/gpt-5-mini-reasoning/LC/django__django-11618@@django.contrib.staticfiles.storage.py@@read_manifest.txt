[THOUGHT]
- read_manifest attempts to open self.manifest_name, which defaults to "staticfiles.json".
- Storage.open calls FileSystemStorage._open which does open(self.path(name), mode).
- self.location is provided as "/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr", so path("staticfiles.json") resolves to "/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr/staticfiles.json".
- The code will try to open that file in binary mode. No file contents for that path are provided in the input, so the open() call would raise FileNotFoundError.
- read_manifest catches FileNotFoundError and returns None.
