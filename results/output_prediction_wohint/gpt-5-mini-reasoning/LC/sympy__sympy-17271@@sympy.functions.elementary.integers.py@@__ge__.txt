[THOUGHT]
We call ceiling.__ge__(self, other) where:
- other is "x"
- self only has "nargs": {} in the input (no information that self.args exists or that self.is_real is True)

The method implementation:
1. if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real: return S.true
   - We don't have a self.args[0] equal to other (no args provided), and "x" as given does not provide is_real True, so this condition does not hold.
2. if other is S.NegativeInfinity and self.is_real: return S.true
   - other is "x", not S.NegativeInfinity, so this is False.
3. Otherwise: return Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)

Therefore the method falls through to returning Ge(self, other, evaluate=False).
I represent that as a symbolic relational object in the output.
