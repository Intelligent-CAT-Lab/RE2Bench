[THOUGHT]
The pattern "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b" matches US-style phone numbers like 123-456-7890. re.split will split the text at each match and return the substrings between matches (no capturing groups, so matches are removed).

Input text:
"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

Matches occur at the three phone numbers. The segments are:
- Before the first match: "" (empty, since the first match is at the start)
- Between first and second: " abiguygusu " (space, word, space)
- Between second and third: " kjgufwycs " (space, word, space)
- After the third match: "" (empty, since the last match is at the end)

So re.split returns: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].
