[THOUGHT]
1. The function first checks sys.platform != 'win32'.
2. In a non-Windows environment (typical for these executions), that condition is true, so the function immediately returns None without calling any further code.
3. The provided handle (null) is irrelevant because execution returns early due to platform check.

    "return": null
