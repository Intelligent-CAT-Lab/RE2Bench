We have x = array([0.,1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.]) (length 10) and one arg array([1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.,10.]). len(args)=1 so steps shape is (1+1, 2*10) = (2,20).

First row (steps[0,...]):
- steps[0, :1] = x[:1] -> steps[0,0] = 0.0
- steps[0, -1:] = x[-1:] -> steps[0,19] = 9.0
- midpoints = (x[:-1] + x[1:]) / 2 = [0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5,8.5] (length 9)
- assigned to steps[0,1:-1:2] (indices 1,3,5,...,17) and steps[0,2::2] (indices 2,4,6,...,18).
So row 0 becomes:
[0.0,0.5,0.5,1.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5.5,5.5,6.5,6.5,7.5,7.5,8.5,8.5,9.0]

Second row (steps[1,...]):
- steps[1:, 0::2] = args -> the even columns 0,2,4,...,18 get [1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.,10.]
- steps[1:, 1::2] = steps[1:, 0::2] duplicates them into odd columns.
So row 1 becomes:
[1.,1.,2.,2.,3.,3.,4.,4.,5.,5.,6.,6.,7.,7.,8.,8.,9.,9.,10.,10.]

Return value is the 2x20 numpy array with these rows.
