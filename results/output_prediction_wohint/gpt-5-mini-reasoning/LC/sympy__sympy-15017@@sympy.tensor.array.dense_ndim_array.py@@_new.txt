We need to simulate ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new with the provided inputs.

1. The method is a classmethod, called with the given cls and iterable. shape argument is null (None).

2. First line inside _new: 
   shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)

   - Given iterable has "rows": 2 and "cols": 2 and "_mat": null. This corresponds to a 2x2 Matrix-like input.
   - _handle_ndarray_creation_inputs will therefore return a shape representing (2, 2) and a flat_list that, when flattened, yields four elements (one per matrix entry). Since the matrix's internal storage (_mat) is null/None, the extracted elements are None (i.e., four None entries).
   => shape becomes (2, 2)
   => flat_list (before flattening) corresponds to the 2x2 data, which flattens into [None, None, None, None].

3. Next: shape = Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))
   - The integers 2 are sympified; effectively the shape becomes Tuple(2, 2). For JSON representation we will show the numbers [2, 2].

4. flat_list = flatten(flat_list)
   - flatten yields the sequence [None, None, None, None].

5. flat_list = Tuple(*flat_list)
   - flat_list is now a sympy Tuple containing four None entries; in JSON we represent them as [null, null, null, null].

6. self = Basic.__new__(cls, flat_list, shape, **kwargs)
   - The created instance will have args equivalent to (flat_list, shape). We'll represent that as "args": [flat_list, shape].

7. Set attributes:
   - self._shape = shape -> Tuple(2,2) -> represented as [2,2]
   - self._array = list(flat_list) -> [None, None, None, None] -> [null, null, null, null]
   - self._rank = len(shape) -> 2
   - self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, shape, 1) -> 1*2*2 = 4

8. The method returns the instance. We'll represent the returned object's main exposed state as a JSON object containing its constructor args and the attributes set above.

So the returned object corresponds to a 2x2 dense array whose flattened contents are four None values, with rank 2 and loop size 4.
