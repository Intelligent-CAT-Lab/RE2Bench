[THOUGHT]
We call Integer.__lt__(self="3", other="1").

1. The method first tries: other = _sympify(other).
2. _sympify("1") with strict=True will raise SympifyError for a plain string (strings are not accepted by _sympify).
3. The SympifyError is caught by the except block, and the method returns NotImplemented immediately.

Therefore the function returns the Python singleton NotImplemented.
