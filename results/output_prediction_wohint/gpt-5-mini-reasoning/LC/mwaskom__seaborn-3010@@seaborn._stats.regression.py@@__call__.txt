[THOUGHT]
We execute PolyFit.__call__:

1. The method body is: return groupby.apply(data.dropna(subset=['x', 'y']), self._fit_predict)
2. It first needs to evaluate data.dropna(...). The provided `data` is a dict-like JSON representation of a pandas DataFrame object, but we don't actually need to evaluate dropna because the next step tries to call apply on `groupby`.
3. The provided `groupby` in the input is a plain JSON object (a Python dict), not a pandas GroupBy object. A plain dict does not have an `apply` method.
4. Attempting to access or call groupby.apply will raise an AttributeError: "'dict' object has no attribute 'apply'".

Thus the call raises an AttributeError and does not return a normal value.
