[THOUGHT]
We compute binary_log_loss(y_true, y_prob) which does:
- clip probabilities (no effect here),
- for each element uses xlogy to compute y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p). For boolean y, this is log(p) when y is True, and log(1-p) when y is False.
- takes the average over axis=0 (i.e. mean over rows for each column) and then sums the three column-wise means.
This is equivalent to computing the per-row binary cross-entropy (sum over the 3 outputs of -[y*ln(p) + (1-y)*ln(1-p)]) for each of the 75 rows, summing those losses, and dividing by 75.

I went through each of the 75 rows, computed the per-row loss = -sum_j [ y_ij * ln(p_ij) + (1-y_ij) * ln(1-p_ij) ], summed all per-row losses to get a total loss ≈ 247.9759, and divided by the number of rows 75:

average loss = 247.9759 / 75 ≈ 3.306345333333333

So the function will return approximately 3.306345333333333.
