[THOUGHT]
The function compiles three regexes and returns the concatenation of their findall results.

Input content:
<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">

- charset_re: '<meta.*?charset=["\\\']*(.+?)["\\\'>]'  
  This finds 'charset=' anywhere in the meta tag and captures the value up to the next quote or '>' char. In the content attribute we have ...charset=UTF-8" so it captures 'UTF-8'. => ['UTF-8']

- pragma_re: '<meta.*?content=["\\\']*;?charset=(.+?)["\\\'>]'  
  This expects 'content="' followed immediately (optionally after a semicolon) by 'charset=...'. In our string 'content="text/html;charset=...' the 'charset=' is not immediately after the opening quote, so this pattern does not match. => []

- xml_re: matches an XML declaration at the start; not applicable. => []

The function also issues a DeprecationWarning, but the return value is the concatenated list: ['UTF-8'].
