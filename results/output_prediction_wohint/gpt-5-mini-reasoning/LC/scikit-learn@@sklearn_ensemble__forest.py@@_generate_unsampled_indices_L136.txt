We need to trace _generate_unsampled_indices(random_state=209652396, n_samples=150, n_samples_bootstrap=150).

1. _generate_unsampled_indices calls _generate_sample_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap).
2. _generate_sample_indices does:
   - random_instance = check_random_state(random_state) — with an integer seed this creates a NumPy RandomState initialized with that seed.
   - sample_indices = random_instance.randint(0, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap, dtype=np.int32)

   This produces 150 integers in the range [0, 150), drawn with replacement, using the Mersenne Twister RNG state seeded with 209652396. The exact sequence of 150 integers depends on the NumPy RandomState's MT19937 implementation and the seed; reproducing the exact sequence requires executing the code (or running MT19937 exactly as NumPy does). Without executing NumPy's RNG here, I cannot deterministically list the 150 drawn indices.

3. Back in _generate_unsampled_indices:
   - sample_counts = np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=150) — yields, for each index 0..149, how many times it was drawn.
   - unsampled_mask = sample_counts == 0 — boolean mask where True indicates that index was never drawn.
   - indices_range = np.arange(150)
   - unsampled_indices = indices_range[unsampled_mask] — array of the indices that were never sampled.

This result is a NumPy array of integers in 0..149. Its length is random but has expected value ≈ 150*(1 - (1 - 1/150)^150) complement ≈ 150 * (1/e) ≈ 55 unsampled indices on average. However, the exact list of indices cannot be produced without actually running the RNG.

Therefore I cannot give the exact deterministic list of unsampled indices from this seed without executing NumPy's RNG. I can, however, describe the form of the output.

(If you want the exact array, run the function in a Python environment with NumPy available and the given seed.)
