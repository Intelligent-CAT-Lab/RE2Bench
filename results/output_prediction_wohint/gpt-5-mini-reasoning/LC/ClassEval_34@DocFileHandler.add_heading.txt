[THOUGHT]
The method tries to open the file at self.file_path using Document(self.file_path). If that succeeds it adds a heading and saves the document, returning True. If opening, adding, or saving raises any exception, the except block returns False.

Given only the file path "test_example.docx" and no guarantee the file exists in the environment, attempting Document("test_example.docx") will likely raise an exception (python-docx raises a PackageNotFoundError / OSError if the file does not exist). That exception would be caught and the method would return False.
