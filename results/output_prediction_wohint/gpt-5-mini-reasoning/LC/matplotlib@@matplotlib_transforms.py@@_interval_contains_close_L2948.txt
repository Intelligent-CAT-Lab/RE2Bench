[THOUGHT]
Parse inputs:
- interval = array([0.001, 1.   ]) → a = 0.001, b = 1.0
- val = array(0.2) → 0.2
- rtol = 1e-10

Since a <= b, keep ordering. Compute scaled rtol:
- b - a = 1.0 - 0.001 = 0.999
- scaled rtol = 0.999 * 1e-10 = 9.99e-11

Compute bounds:
- lower = a - scaled_rtol = 0.001 - 9.99e-11 = 0.0009999999001
- upper = b + scaled_rtol = 1.0 + 9.99e-11 = 1.0000000000999

Check membership:
- 0.0009999999001 <= 0.2 <= 1.0000000000999 is True

So the function returns True.
