[THOUGHT]
1. TR6 calls _TR56(rv, f=cos, g=sin, h=lambda x: 1-x, max=4, pow=False).
2. Inside _TR56, a helper _f is created that only transforms expressions which are Pow (rv.is_Pow) whose base.func == f (i.e., powers of cos(...)).
3. The given rv is cos(phi), which is not a power expression (rv.is_Pow is False), so _f would return rv unchanged.
4. bottom_up applied to cos(phi) with this _f will therefore return the same expression cos(phi).
5. Thus TR6 returns cos(phi).
