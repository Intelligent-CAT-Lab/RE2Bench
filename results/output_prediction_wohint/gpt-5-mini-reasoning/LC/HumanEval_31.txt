[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives n = 13441. Since n >= 2, it proceeds to the loop.
2. The loop iterates k from 2 up to n-2 (i.e., 2..13439), but we only need to check for divisors up to sqrt(13441) ≈ 116.
3. Test divisibility by primes up to 113: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,101,103,107,109,113. None of these divide 13441 evenly (checked remainders).
4. No divisor is found in the loop, so the function returns True (13441 is prime according to this function).
