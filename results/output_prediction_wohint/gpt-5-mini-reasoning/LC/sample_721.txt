[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
2. count = len(nums) = 5.
3. The for-loop runs for num in range(2, count) → range(2, 5) → iterations for num = 2, 3, 4 (three iterations).
4. In each iteration it calls nums.sort(), which sorts the list in-place. The list is already in ascending order, so sorting does not change it.
5. After the loop, the function returns nums, which remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
