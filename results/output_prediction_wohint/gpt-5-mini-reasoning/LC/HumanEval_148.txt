[THOUGHT]
We run bf("Earth", "Earth").
- planet_names is the tuple of planet names.
- The function first checks if either planet is not in planet_names or if planet1 == planet2.
- Since planet1 == planet2 ("Earth" == "Earth"), the function returns () — an empty tuple.
In JSON output I'll represent the empty tuple as an empty list to show an empty sequence.
