[THOUGHT]
The multiply method attempts to access c1.real and c1.imag. The provided c1 and c2 are strings ("(-1-2j)" and "(-3-4j)"), and Python str objects do not have attributes real or imag. Attempting to evaluate c1.real raises an AttributeError before any arithmetic is performed.

So the call will raise:
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real'
[/THOUGHT]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "exception": "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real'"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
