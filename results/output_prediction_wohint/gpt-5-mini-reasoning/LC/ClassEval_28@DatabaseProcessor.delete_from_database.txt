[THOUGHT]
Execution steps:
1. Method is called with self.database_name = "test.db", table_name = "test_table", name = "Alice".
2. Connects to SQLite database: sqlite3.connect("test.db").
3. Creates a cursor.
4. Constructs delete_query = f'DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?' -> "DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?".
5. Executes cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,)) with parameter ("Alice",).
6. Commits the transaction and closes the connection.
7. The method has no return statement, so it returns None.

(If the table did not exist an exception would be raised, but assuming normal execution, the result is None.)
