[THOUGHT]
The load_image method does the following:
- Calls Image.open(image_path) which (on success) returns a PIL Image object.
- Assigns that object to self.image.
- The method has no return statement, so it returns None (Python default).

Assuming the file path is valid and Image.open succeeds, the method will set self.image to the opened Image and return None. If the file were missing or unreadable, Image.open would raise an exception, but we assume success here.
