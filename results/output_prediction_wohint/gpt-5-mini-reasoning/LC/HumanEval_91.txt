[THOUGHT]
1. The function splits S by the regex '[.?!]\s*' into sentences. For S = "bIt", there are no sentence-ending punctuation marks, so re.split returns ['bIt'].
2. The function then checks for each sentence whether sentence[0:2] == 'I '. For the single sentence 'bIt', sentence[0:2] is 'bI'.
3. Compare 'bI' == 'I ' → False.
4. The generator yields one False, sum of booleans treats False as 0, so the result is 0.
