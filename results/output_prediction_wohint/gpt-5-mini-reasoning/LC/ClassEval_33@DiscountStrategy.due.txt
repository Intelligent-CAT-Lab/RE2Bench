[THOUGHT]
We evaluate DiscountStrategy.due for the given self.

- The instance already has _DiscountStrategy__total = 150.0 (total price of the cart).
- self.promotion is provided (not None). In the context of the typical promotions set, this promotion is the fidelity-based promotion that gives a 5% discount when customer.fidelity >= 1000.
- Customer fidelity is 1200, so the promotion discount = 5% of 150.0 = 0.05 * 150.0 = 7.5.
- due() returns total - discount = 150.0 - 7.5 = 142.5.
