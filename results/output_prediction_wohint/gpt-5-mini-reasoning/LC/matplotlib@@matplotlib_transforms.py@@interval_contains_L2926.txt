[THOUGHT]
The function does: a, b = interval. The provided interval is the string "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])", not a sequence of two elements. Python will try to iterate the string by characters and attempt to unpack into two variables, but the string has more than two characters, so unpacking fails and a ValueError is raised: "too many values to unpack (expected 2)".

    "exception": "ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)"
