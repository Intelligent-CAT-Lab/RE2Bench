[THOUGHT]
The method does:
- tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root). With self.root = None, ElementTree(None) is allowed (creates an empty tree).
- tree.write(file_name) is then called with file_name = "" (empty string). ElementTree.write will try to open the given filename; attempting to open an empty filename raises an OSError/FileNotFoundError.
- The exception is caught by the broad except, so the method returns False.
Therefore the output is False.
