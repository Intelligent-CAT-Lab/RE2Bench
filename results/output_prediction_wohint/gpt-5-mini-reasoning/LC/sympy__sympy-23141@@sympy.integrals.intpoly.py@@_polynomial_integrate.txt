[THOUGHT]
We call _polynomial_integrate(polynomials, facets, hp_params) with:
- polynomials = {"2": "x*y"}
- facets = None
- hp_params = None

Execution steps:
1. dims = (x, y) and dim_length = 2. integral_value = S.Zero.
2. The outer for-loop iterates over keys of polynomials; there is one key: the string "2". The loop body sets poly_contribute = S.Zero and facet_count = 0.
3. Next line is "for hp in hp_params:". But hp_params is None, so trying to iterate over it raises a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.
4. Therefore the function does not complete normally and raises a TypeError before producing any numeric/symbolic result.

So the result is an exception: TypeError("'NoneType' object is not iterable").
