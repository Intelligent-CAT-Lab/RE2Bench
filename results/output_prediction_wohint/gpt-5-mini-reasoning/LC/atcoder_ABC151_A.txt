[THOUGHT]
The program reads one character from input, takes its Unicode code point with ord(), adds 1, converts back with chr(), and prints the result.

The provided input value is "\"a\"" which represents the character a as the input. So input() returns 'a'.
ord('a') = 97; 97 + 1 = 98; chr(98) = 'b'.
The program prints: b

    "output": "b"
}
