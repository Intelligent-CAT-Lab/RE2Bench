[THOUGHT]
We call _parallel_fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, sample_weight=None).

1. sample_weight is None, so the function will execute estimator.fit(X, y).
2. The provided estimator dict corresponds to a GaussianNB estimator (priors: null, var_smoothing: 1e-09). Calling fit will train the estimator on X and y and then return the fitted estimator object.
3. _parallel_fit_estimator then returns that estimator object.

Because the input represents the estimator as a simple dict with the given attributes and we are not asked to produce all fitted attributes, the returned value is the (fitted) estimator — represented here by the same estimator dictionary with priors null and var_smoothing 1e-09 (i.e., the estimator object itself).
