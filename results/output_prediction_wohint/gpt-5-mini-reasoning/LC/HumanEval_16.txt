[THOUGHT]
We call count_distinct_characters with string = "Jerry jERRY JeRRRY".

1. Lowercase the string: "Jerry jERRY JeRRRY".lower() -> "jerry jerry jerrry" (note the last word has three 'r's).
2. Build a set of characters in that lowercase string: characters present are 'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', and the space ' '.
3. The size of that set is 5.

So the function returns 5.
