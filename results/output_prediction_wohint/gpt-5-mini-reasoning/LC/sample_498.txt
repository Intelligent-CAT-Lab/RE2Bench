[THOUGHT]
We call f with nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], idx = 2, added = 3.
Inside f, the statement nums[idx:idx] = (added,) assigns the one-element tuple (3,) to the empty slice at position 2, which inserts 3 at index 2 without removing any elements.
So the list becomes: elements before index 2 -> [2, 2], then inserted 3, then the remaining original elements starting from old index 2 -> [3, 2, 3, 3].
Final list: [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]
