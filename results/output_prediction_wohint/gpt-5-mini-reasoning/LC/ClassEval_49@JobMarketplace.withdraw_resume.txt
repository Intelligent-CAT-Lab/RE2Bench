[THOUGHT]
We call JobMarketplace.withdraw_resume with self.resumes = [] and resume = {"name": "Tom", ...}.
The method does: self.resumes.remove(resume).
Since the resume object is not in the empty list, list.remove raises a ValueError with message "list.remove(x): x not in list".
No return value; the call results in that exception being raised.
