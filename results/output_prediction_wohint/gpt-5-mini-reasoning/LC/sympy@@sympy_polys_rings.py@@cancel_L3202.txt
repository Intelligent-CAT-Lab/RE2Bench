[THOUGHT]
We execute PolyElement.cancel(self, g).

1. f = self. The provided "self" has no coefficients (only the ring is given), so f is the zero polynomial (falsey).
2. The code checks "if not f: return (f, ring.one)". Because f is zero, it immediately returns (f, ring.one).
3. ring.one is the unit polynomial, represented by the zero-monomial with coefficient 1. For 4 variables that monomial is the tuple (0, 0, 0, 0), so ring.one corresponds to {(0, 0, 0, 0): 1}.
4. Therefore the returned tuple is (zero polynomial, unit polynomial) — represented here as an empty coefficient mapping for the zero polynomial and a mapping with the zero monomial for the unit.

So the result is the pair: {} and {"(0, 0, 0, 0)": 1}.
