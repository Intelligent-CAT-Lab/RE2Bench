[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives lst = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2].
2. It computes sorted(set(lst)). set(lst) removes duplicates (there are none), giving {1,2,3,4,5}. sorted(...) yields [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
3. len(lst) is 5, which is >= 2, so the function returns the element at index 1 of the sorted list.
4. The element at index 1 is 2.
