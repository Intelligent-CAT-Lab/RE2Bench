[THOUGHT]
The method attempts to open "read_test_process.csv" for writing and write the provided rows using csv.writer.
- It opens the file with mode 'w' and newline='' (should succeed in normal environment).
- writer.writerows writes two rows: ["a","b","c","d"] and ["ME"].
- No exception is raised, so the try block completes and the method returns 1.
Therefore the output is 1.
