[THOUGHT]
We call _generate_indices(random_state, bootstrap=True, n_population=4, n_samples=1).

- Because bootstrap is True, the function executes:
  indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)

- That calls randint(0, 4, 1) on the provided RandomState instance, producing a length-1 array with a single integer in {0,1,2,3}.

Assuming the RandomState instance yields 0 for this call, the returned indices array is [0].
