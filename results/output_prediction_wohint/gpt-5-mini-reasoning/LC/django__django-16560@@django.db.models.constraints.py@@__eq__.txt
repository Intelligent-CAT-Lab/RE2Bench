[THOUGHT]
1. The __eq__ method first checks isinstance(other, CheckConstraint). The provided "other" structure represents another CheckConstraint instance (same attributes), so this check is True.
2. It then evaluates the boolean expression:
   - self.name == other.name: "price" == "price" -> True
   - self.check == other.check: the dicts with keys ("children", "connector", "negated") are identical -> True
   - self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code: "custom_code" == "custom_code" -> True
   - self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message: both have identical proxy args and kw -> True
3. All parts are True, so the whole expression is True and __eq__ returns True.
