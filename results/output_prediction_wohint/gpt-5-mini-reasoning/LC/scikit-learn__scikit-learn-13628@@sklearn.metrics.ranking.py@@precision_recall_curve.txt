[THOUGHT]
1. precision_recall_curve is called with y_true=None and probas_pred=None.
2. It calls _binary_clf_curve(y_true, y_score=probas_pred, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None).
3. In _binary_clf_curve the first step is to determine y_type = type_of_target(y_true).
4. type_of_target receives y = None. It computes:
   valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str))
   For y=None, both checks fail, so valid is False.
5. Since valid is False, type_of_target raises a ValueError with the message:
   "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None"
6. This exception propagates out, so precision_recall_curve does not return normal arrays but raises the same ValueError.

Therefore the output is an exception: ValueError with that message.
