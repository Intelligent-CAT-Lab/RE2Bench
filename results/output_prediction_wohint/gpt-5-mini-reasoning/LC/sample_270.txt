[THOUGHT]
1. The input `dic` is an empty dict: {}.
2. The function initializes `d = {}`.
3. The for-loop `for key in dic:` has no iterations because `dic` is empty, so the loop body (which would call `dic.popitem(last=False)`) is never executed.
4. The function returns the empty dict `d`.
Note: Although `popitem(last=False)` would not be valid on a plain dict if called, it is irrelevant here because it's never reached.
