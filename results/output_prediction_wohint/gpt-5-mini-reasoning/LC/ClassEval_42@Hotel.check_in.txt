[THOUGHT]
We call check_in with room_type "single". booked_rooms has the key "single" (value is an empty dict), so the first if (room_type not in keys) is false and we continue.

Next the code checks if name ("guest 1") is in booked_rooms["single"]. That dict is empty, so the condition is false; the body (which contains returns or mutations) is skipped.

There is no further code or explicit return, so the function finishes and returns None implicitly.
