[THOUGHT]
1. __pow__ receives n = -2. It first checks isinstance(n, Permutation) — false.
2. It converts n = int(n) -> -2.
3. It then calls _af_pow(self.array_form, n). self._array_form is None, but self._size is 7. The permutation's array_form property (when _array_form is None) will be computed as the identity array of length 7: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].
4. Powering the identity permutation by -2 yields the identity again (inverse and powers of the identity are identity).
5. _af_new wraps that array-form into a new Permutation object. The resulting permutation has array form [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] and size 7 (cyclic form remains None).

So the returned object corresponds to the identity permutation on 7 elements.
