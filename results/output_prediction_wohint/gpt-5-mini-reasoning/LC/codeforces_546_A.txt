[THOUGHT]
Step-by-step execution:
1. input().strip().split() receives the input line. The provided JSON value "\"1 1 1\"" represents the console input: 1 1 1.
2. Splitting gives the strings ["1", "1", "1"].
3. Mapping to int yields k = 1, n = 1, w = 1.
4. sum starts at 0. Loop i from 1 to w (1):
   - i = 1: sum += k * i -> sum = 0 + 1*1 = 1.
5. After the loop sum = 1. Check if sum <= n: 1 <= 1 is true, so the program prints 0.
