[THOUGHT]
We simulate the program step by step.

- The input line is: 1 0 1
- After splitting and mapping to int: N = 1, A = 0, B = 1
- Compute A + B = 1
- ans = N // (A + B) * A = 1 // 1 * 0 = 1 * 0 = 0
- rem = N % (A + B) = 1 % 1 = 0
- ans += min(rem, A) = 0 + min(0, 0) = 0
- The program prints: 0
