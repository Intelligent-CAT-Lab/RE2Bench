[THOUGHT]
We compute micro-averaged F1 for the two provided label arrays. For multiclass single-label classification, micro F1 equals overall accuracy (total correct / total samples).

Parse the arrays (both have length 75). Compare elementwise and count matches:
- Total matches found = 39
- Total samples = 75

Micro F1 = accuracy = 39 / 75 = 13 / 25 = 0.52

So the function will return 0.52.
