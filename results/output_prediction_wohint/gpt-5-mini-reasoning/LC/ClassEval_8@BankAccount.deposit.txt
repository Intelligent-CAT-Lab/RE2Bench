[THOUGHT]
We have a BankAccount instance with balance = 0. The deposit method is called with amount = 300.
1. Check if amount < 0: 300 is not less than 0, so no exception.
2. Add amount to balance: 0 + 300 = 300. Update self.balance to 300.
3. Return the new balance, which is 300.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": 300
}
```
