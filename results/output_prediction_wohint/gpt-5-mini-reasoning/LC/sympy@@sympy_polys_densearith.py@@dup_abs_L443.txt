[THOUGHT]
The function does a list comprehension: return [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f].

Inputs: f = [2], K = "ZZ" (a Python str).

It will try to call "ZZ".abs(2) for the first (and only) coeff = 2. str objects do not have an abs method, so Python raises an AttributeError on that call.

Therefore the function does not return a list; it raises AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'abs'.
