DomainMatrix.to_list returns self.rep.to_list(). The rep provided matches an SDM/DDM-like structure, so the called to_list will build a 2x2 list and fill entries from rep.

Steps:
- Shape is (2,2), so initialize ddm = [[zero, zero], [zero, zero]]. We assume domain.zero is 0.
- Fill ddm[0][0] with rep[0][0] which is "Matrix([\n[1, 0],\n[0, 1]])"
- Fill ddm[0][1] with rep[0][1] which is "Matrix([\n[1, 2, 3],\n[3, 5, 4]])"
- Fill ddm[1][0] with rep[1][0] which is "Matrix([\n[4, 2],\n[2, 3],\n[7, 5]])"
- Fill ddm[1][1] with rep[1][1] which is "Matrix([\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1]])"

The resulting list of lists is returned with those four matrix entries in the corresponding positions.
