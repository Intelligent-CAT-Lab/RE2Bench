[THOUGHT]
We call math_to_image with s="$x^2$", prop=None, dpi=None, format=None, color=None, and filename_or_obj is the string "PosixPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/example.png')".

1. MathTextParser('path') is created (vector output).
2. parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=None) returns a tuple (width, height, depth, _, _). For the simple inline expression "$x^2$" there is no ink below the baseline, so depth is 0.0 (width and height are positive numbers but not needed for the return).
3. A Figure is created with figsize=(width/72.0, height/72.0).
4. fig.text is called with y = depth / height = 0.0, placing the text at the baseline.
5. fig.savefig is called with the given filename string (matplotlib will attempt to write a file with that literal name).
6. The function returns depth, which is 0.0.

Thus the function returns 0.0.
