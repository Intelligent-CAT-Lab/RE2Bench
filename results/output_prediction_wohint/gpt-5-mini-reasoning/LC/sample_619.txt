[THOUGHT]
The function f returns title.lower(). It does not strip or otherwise alter whitespace.

Input title is "   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  " (three leading spaces, triple spaces between words, two trailing spaces).

Applying .lower() converts letters to lowercase but preserves all spaces, yielding "   rock   paper   scissors  ".
