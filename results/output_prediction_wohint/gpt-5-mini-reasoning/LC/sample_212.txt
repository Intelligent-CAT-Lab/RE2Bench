[THOUGHT]
The function reverses the list in-place len(nums) - 1 times.
Here len(nums) = 7, so the loop runs 6 times.
Reversing toggles the list between original and reversed each time. After an even number (6) of reversals, the list returns to its original order.
So the output is the same as the input list.
