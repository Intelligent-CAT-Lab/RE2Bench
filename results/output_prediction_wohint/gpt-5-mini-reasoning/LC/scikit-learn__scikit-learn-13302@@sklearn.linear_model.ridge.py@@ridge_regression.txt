[THOUGHT]
We call ridge_regression which delegates to _ridge_regression with alpha=1.0 and return_intercept=False, so it solves (X^T X + alpha I) coef = X^T y for the coefficients.

1. Parse X (6x5) and y (length 6) from the input.
2. Compute X^T y (5 elements) — I computed approximately:
   X^T y ≈ [-4.19069, -2.19475, -5.48699, -17.6723, -16.6266]
3. Compute X^T X (5x5) and add alpha*I (alpha=1):
   A = X^T X + I ≈
   [[13.83188, -1.24926, -0.016946, 3.83895, -5.25952],
    [-1.24926, 6.83931, 1.604896, 1.028111, 2.05766],
    [-0.016946,1.604896,3.384399,1.309312,3.964386],
    [3.83895,1.028111,1.309312,9.044245,4.496688],
    [-5.25952,2.05766,3.964386,4.496688,12.892443]]
4. Solve A coef = X^T y numerically. I performed Gaussian elimination with rounding; the back-substitution gives the coefficient vector approximately:
   coef ≈ [-0.22846, 0.14094, -0.11407, -1.42168, -0.87519]

Thus the function returns the coefficient array (no intercept, since return_intercept=False).
