[THOUGHT]
We run truncate_number(number: float) -> number % 1.0.

1. Input number is 1.33.
2. number % 1.0 returns the fractional part of the positive number: mathematically 1.33 - 1 = 0.33.
3. Due to IEEE-754 floating-point representation, the result is not represented exactly as 0.33 but as the closest binary float, which prints as 0.32999999999999996.

So the function returns 0.32999999999999996.
