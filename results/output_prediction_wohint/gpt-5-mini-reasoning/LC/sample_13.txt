Step-by-step execution:
1. The function receives names = ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"].
2. count = len(names) sets count = 3 (this variable is not used afterwards).
3. numberOfNames is initialized to 0.
4. Loop over each name:
   - "sharron".isalpha() -> True (only alphabetic characters), so numberOfNames becomes 1.
   - "Savannah".isalpha() -> True, so numberOfNames becomes 2.
   - "Mike Cherokee".isalpha() -> False (contains a space), so numberOfNames remains 2.
5. The function returns numberOfNames, which is 2.
