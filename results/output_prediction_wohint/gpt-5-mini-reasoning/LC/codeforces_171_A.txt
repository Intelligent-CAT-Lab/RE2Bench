[THOUGHT]
The program does the following:
- Reads a line and splits it into a and b.
- Reverses the string b (b[::-1]), converts that to int.
- Converts a to int and prints int(a) + int(reversed b).

Given the input string "982906996 135497281" (two numbers separated by a space):

- a = "982906996"
- b = "135497281"
- b[::-1] = "182794531"
- int(a) = 982906996
- int(b[::-1]) = 182794531
- Sum = 982,906,996 + 182,794,531 = 1,165,701,527

The program will print:
1,165,701,527 (without commas)
