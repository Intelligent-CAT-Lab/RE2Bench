[THOUGHT]
We call clean_non_binary_chars on an object whose binary_string is "01101000011011010110001001101111".
The method builds ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string)).
All characters in the given string are '0' or '1', so the filtered result is the same string.
The method assigns that back to self.binary_string and does not return anything explicitly, so it returns None (null in JSON).
