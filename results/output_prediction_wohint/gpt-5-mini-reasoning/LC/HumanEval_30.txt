[THOUGHT]
We run get_positive on the provided list.

1. The function uses a list comprehension: [e for e in l if e > 0].
2. Iterate elements of l = [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]:
   - -1 > 0? no -> excluded
   - -2 > 0? no -> excluded
   - 4 > 0? yes -> included
   - 5 > 0? yes -> included
   - 6 > 0? yes -> included
3. The resulting list is [4, 5, 6], which is returned.
