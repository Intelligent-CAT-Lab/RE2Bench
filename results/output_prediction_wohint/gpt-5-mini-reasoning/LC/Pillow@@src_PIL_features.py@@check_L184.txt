[THOUGHT]
The check function will look up the feature name in the module-level registries in this order: modules, codecs, features.

- The input feature is "freetype2". That is not in modules or codecs, but it is a known feature in Pillow's features mapping, so check() calls check_feature("freetype2").

- check_feature verifies the feature exists in features, then gets (module, flag, ver) = features["freetype2"] (the module is the compiled PIL freetype support module, e.g. "PIL._imagingft").

- It then tries to import that module. If the compiled freetype support extension module is not present on the import path, the import raises ModuleNotFoundError and check_feature returns None. If the module is present, it returns getattr(imported_module, flag) (a boolean indicating availability).

- Given no runtime information that the compiled freetype extension is present, the safe simulated outcome is that importing "PIL._imagingft" fails (ModuleNotFoundError) and check_feature returns None. check() returns that None to the caller.

Thus the function returns None (JSON null).
