[THOUGHT]
We compute elementwise products and sums. a_rows and b_rows are identical, so (a_rows * b_rows).sum() equals count of True in a_rows. Counting Trues in a_rows gives 7. a_cols and b_cols are identical; counting Trues in a_cols gives 8. Thus:

intersection = 7 * 8 = 56
a_size = 7 * 8 = 56
b_size = 7 * 8 = 56

Jaccard = intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection) = 56 / (56 + 56 - 56) = 56 / 56 = 1.0
