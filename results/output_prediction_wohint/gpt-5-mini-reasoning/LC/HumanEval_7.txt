The function returns all strings that contain the substring "run".

Check each input:
- "grunt": contains "run" (characters 1-3) → include.
- "trumpet": does not contain "run" → exclude.
- "prune": contains "run" (characters 1-3) → include.
- "gruesome": does not contain "run" → exclude.

Resulting list: ["grunt", "prune"].
