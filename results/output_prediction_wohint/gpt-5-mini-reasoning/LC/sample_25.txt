[THOUGHT]
1. The function copies the input dict so the original is not modified.
2. d.popitem() removes the last inserted key-value pair. Given the insertion order in the input, the last key is "x:" with value 3, so that pair is removed.
3. The function returns the remaining dictionary which contains keys "l" and "t" with values 1 and 2 respectively.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "output": {
    "l": 1,
    "t": 2
  }
}
