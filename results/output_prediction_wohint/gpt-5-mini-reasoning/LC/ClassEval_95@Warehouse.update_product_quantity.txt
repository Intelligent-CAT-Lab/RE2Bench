[THOUGHT]
We call update_product_quantity with product_id = 1 (int) and quantity = -3.
The method checks "if product_id in self.inventory". Inventory keys are strings: "1".
Since 1 (int) != "1" (str), the key is not found, the if-block is not executed, and no change is made.
The method has no return statement, so it returns None.
