[THOUGHT]
1. verify calls self._load_library().
2. _load_library sees self.library == 'argon2' and attempts importlib.import_module('argon2').
3. If the 'argon2' module is not available, importlib.import_module raises ImportError.
4. _load_library catches ImportError and raises ValueError(
   "Couldn't load %r algorithm library: %s" % (self.__class__.__name__, e)
   ), which becomes:
   "Couldn't load 'Argon2PasswordHasher' algorithm library: No module named 'argon2'".
5. verify does not catch this ValueError, so the call to verify will raise that ValueError rather than returning a boolean.

Therefore the function raises a ValueError indicating the argon2 library couldn't be loaded.
