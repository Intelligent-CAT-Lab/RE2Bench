[THOUGHT]
We call f with array = [].

1. Check "while -1 in array": since array is empty, -1 not in array → loop body not executed.
2. Check "while 0 in array": 0 not in array → loop body not executed.
3. Check "while 1 in array": 1 not in array → loop body not executed.
4. No modifications made; function returns the original empty list.

Final returned value is [].
