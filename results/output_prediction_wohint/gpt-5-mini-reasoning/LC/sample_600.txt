[THOUGHT]
1. The input array is an empty list [].
2. just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array)) maps over an empty list, so just_ns becomes [].
3. final_output is initialized to [].
4. The for loop iterates over just_ns which is empty, so no items are appended.
5. The function returns final_output which is [].
