[THOUGHT]
The program reads a line and splits it into three integers. The provided input corresponds to the three integers 7, 5, 5.

- ABC becomes (7, 5, 5).
- ABC.count(5) == 2 is True (there are two 5's).
- sum(ABC) == 17 is True (7 + 5 + 5 = 17).

Since both conditions hold, the program prints "YES".
