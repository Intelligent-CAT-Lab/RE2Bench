[THOUGHT]
We apply TR111 which does bottom_up(rv, f).

1. rv is cos(phi)**2, which is a Pow with base = cos(phi) and exp = 2.
2. bottom_up will traverse to the leaves first, but none of the subnodes cause f to change anything (phi and cos(phi) are not Pow powers that meet f's conditions).
3. f checks: isinstance(rv, Pow) — True for cos(phi)**2.
   Then it requires (rv.base.is_positive or (rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative)).
   - rv.base.is_positive for cos(phi) is unknown (None), not True.
   - rv.exp.is_integer is True, but rv.exp.is_negative is False (2 is not negative).
   So the combined condition is False, so f returns rv unchanged.
4. Therefore bottom_up returns the original expression unchanged: cos(phi)**2.

Final returned value: cos(phi)**2
