[THOUGHT]
We call ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction._eval_expand_trig(self) with no hints.

1. Method body is: return self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)
2. It attempts to access attribute _calculate_reciprocal on the provided self object.
3. The provided self representation only contains nargs (with _args_set) and does not include any _calculate_reciprocal attribute.
4. Attempting to call self._calculate_reciprocal therefore raises an AttributeError indicating the object has no such attribute.

So the call does not return a normal value; it raises an AttributeError.
