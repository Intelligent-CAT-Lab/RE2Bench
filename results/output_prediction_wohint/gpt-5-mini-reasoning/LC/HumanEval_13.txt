[THOUGHT]
We call greatest_common_divisor(10, 15).

Initial values: a = 10, b = 15.

Loop iteration 1:
- b is 15 (truthy).
- Compute a, b = (b, a % b) => a = 15, b = 10 % 15 = 10.

Loop iteration 2:
- b is 10 (truthy).
- Compute a, b = (b, a % b) => a = 10, b = 15 % 10 = 5.

Loop iteration 3:
- b is 5 (truthy).
- Compute a, b = (b, a % b) => a = 5, b = 10 % 5 = 0.

Loop ends because b is 0. Function returns a, which is 5.
