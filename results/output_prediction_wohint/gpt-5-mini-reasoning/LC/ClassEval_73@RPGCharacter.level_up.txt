[THOUGHT]
We start with an RPGCharacter whose attributes are:
- level = 3
- hp = 140
- attack_power = 30
- defense = 20
- exp = 0

level_up checks if level < 100. Since 3 < 100, it increments level by 1 → 4, sets exp = 0 (remains 0), increases hp by 20 → 160, attack_power by 5 → 35, and defense by 5 → 25. The method returns a tuple (level, hp, attack_power, defense) which becomes (4, 160, 35, 25).
