[THOUGHT]
We call _StrPath.__eq__(self, other) with other being the Python string:
"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')".

Steps:
1. The method first checks isinstance(other, PurePath). other is a str, so this is False.
2. Next it checks isinstance(other, str). This is True, so it issues a Deprecation/RemovedInSphinx10Warning via warnings.warn(...) and then returns self.__str__() == other.
3. self.__str__() for a Path-like object would be the path string (e.g. "/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html"), not including the "_StrPath(...)" wrapper.
4. Comparing that plain path string to the provided other string which includes the class name and parentheses ("_StrPath('/tmp/...')") yields False.

So the method returns False and a RemovedInSphinx10Warning is emitted.
