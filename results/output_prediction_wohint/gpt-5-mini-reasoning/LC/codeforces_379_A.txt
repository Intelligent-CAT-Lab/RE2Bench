[THOUGHT]
The input line provides two integers: a = 80 and b = 970.

Initial values:
- x = a = 80
- h = 0
- s = 0

First while loop runs x times (80 iterations), each iteration does:
- x -= 1
- h += 1
- s += 1

After that loop:
- x = 0
- h = 80
- s = 80

Second while loop condition: s // b != 0. Compute 80 // 970 = 0, so the loop body does not execute.

Finally, the program prints h, which is 80.
