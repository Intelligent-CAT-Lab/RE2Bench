I apologize, but it seems there was an error in my previous response. The correct input for the `_complement` function, given the output `_elements = "frozenset({1})"`, is not as I previously stated.

However, based on the provided output, I can infer that the function `_complement` is being used in a context where it is expecting a `FiniteSet` object as input. The `_elements` attribute is a part of this object, which contains a frozenset of elements.

Given the output, I would deduce that the input `other` is a `FiniteSet` with the elements `{1}`. Therefore, the correct input for the `_complement` function is a `FiniteSet` object containing `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.

Here is the corrected input:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "other": {
            "_elements": "frozenset({2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9})"
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
