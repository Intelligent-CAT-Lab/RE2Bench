The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` is being used to perform orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with the Gram matrix and target vector as inputs. Given the provided output, I will try to predict the input that led to this result.

The output shows that the function returned a 1D array with two non-zero values, [0.         2.33249979 0.         0.         0.         0.]. This suggests that the input Gram matrix and target vector are such that the OMP algorithm converges to a solution with two non-zero coefficients.

The Gram matrix `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` and target vector `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` are consistent with this output. The `n_nonzero_coefs` parameter is set to 2, which means that the algorithm will stop when it has found two non-zero coefficients. The `tol` parameter is set to 0.01, which is a relatively small value, indicating that the algorithm should converge to a precise solution.

Therefore, the input that led to the provided output is likely:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {
        "Gram": [[0, 1], [1, 0]],
        "Xy": [[0, 1], [1, 0]],
        "n_nonzero_coefs": 2,
        "tol": 0.01,
        "norms_squared": [1, 1],
        "copy_Xy": true
    }
}
```

This input should produce the output provided, which is a 1D array with two non-zero values.
