Okay, so I need to figure out what input would cause the function `starts_one_ends` to return 18000. Let me start by understanding the function better.

The function is defined as:
def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)

Hmm, so when n is 1, it returns 1. For any other n, it calculates 18 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of (n - 2). Let's see what values of n would give us 18000.

First, let's check if n=1 would work. Since 18000 is definitely not 1, n can't be 1. So we need to look at the second part of the function: 18 * 10^(n-2).

We need to find n such that 18 * 10^(n-2) = 18000.

Let me solve for n. Let's divide both sides by 18:
10^(n-2) = 18000 / 18

Calculating the right side: 18000 divided by 18. Let's do that division. 18 times 1000 is 18000, so 18000 / 18 = 1000.

So now the equation is 10^(n-2) = 1000.

What power of 10 gives 1000? Well, 10^3 = 1000. So:
n - 2 = 3
Adding 2 to both sides gives n = 5.

Wait, let me check that again. If n=5, then 10^(5-2) is 10^3 which is 1000. Multiply by 18 gives 18000. Yes, that works.

So the input n should be 5. Let me make sure there aren't other possible values. Let's test n=5 in the function:

starts_one_ends(5) would compute 18 * 10^(5-2) = 18 * 10^3 = 18 * 1000 = 18000. That's correct.

What if n was 6? Then 10^(6-2) = 10^4 = 10000. 18*10000=180000, which is way bigger than 18000. So n=5 is the only solution here.

Therefore, the input to the function should be n=5.
