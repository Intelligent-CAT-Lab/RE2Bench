The output `3.4222022694919696` corresponds to `-ln(0.032640243)`. This value is obtained when the true label is `1` and the predicted probability is approximately `0.032640243`, or symmetrically when the true label is `0` and predicted probability is `1 - 0.032640243 = 0.967359757`. Assuming minimum standard inputs, `y_true` is `[1]` and `y_prob` is `[0.032640243]`.
