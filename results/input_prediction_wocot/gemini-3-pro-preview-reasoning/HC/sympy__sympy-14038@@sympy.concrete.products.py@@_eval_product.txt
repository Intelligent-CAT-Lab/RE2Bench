The input arguments for `_eval_product` that result in `nan` given the execution traces involving polynomial factorization and `RisingFactorial` evaluation are a polynomial term with integer roots such that the product calculation leads to an indeterminate form (like $0 \times \infty$), and limits involving infinity.

The term `k**2 - 3*k + 2` factors into `(k-1)(k-2)`. With `a=0` and `n=oo`:
- The product involves terms for $k=0, 1, 2, \dots$.
- At $k=1$, the term is 0. At $k=2$, the term is 0. This introduces a 0 factor in the product.
- The product is infinite in length ($n=\infty$), leading to $RisingFactorial$ terms of the form $RisingFactorial(x, \infty)$.
- Specifically, the computation involves $RisingFactorial(-1, \infty)$ or $RisingFactorial(-2, \infty)$.
- $RisingFactorial(-1, \infty) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\Gamma(n-1)}{\Gamma(-1)}$. Since $\Gamma(-1)$ is a pole ($\infty$), this leads to `nan`.
- Or simply, the combination of a zero factor and the infinite product length (and leading coefficient behavior) results in `nan`.

The use of `dup_zz_hensel_lift` and other polynomial factorization functions confirm the term is a polynomial that requires factorization (degree $\ge 3$ or reducible quadratic handled by `factor_list`). `k**2 - 3*k + 2` matches these characteristics.
