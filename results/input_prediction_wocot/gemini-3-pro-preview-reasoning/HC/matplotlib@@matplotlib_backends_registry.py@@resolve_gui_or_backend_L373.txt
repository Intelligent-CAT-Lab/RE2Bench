Based on the analysis of the provided Python code and execution trace:

1.  **Function Call Trace**: The execution trace lists `backend_for_gui_framework` and `resolve_backend`. This implies:
    *   `resolve_gui_or_backend` was called.
    *   `backend_for_gui_framework` was called but presumably returned `None`, forcing execution to proceed to `resolve_backend` (if it had returned a value, `resolve_backend` would not be called).
    *   `resolve_backend` was called.
    *   `_ensure_entry_points_loaded` is **not** in the trace. This implies that the backend was found immediately (in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` or `_backend_to_gui_framework`) without needing to load entry points. Since `_backend_to_gui_framework` is empty in the structure, the backend must be in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`.

2.  **Input Identification**:
    *   The input `gui_or_backend` must not be a key in `_GUI_FRAMEWORK_TO_BACKEND` (e.g., 'qt', 'macosx', 'headless'), otherwise `resolve_backend` wouldn't start.
    *   The input `gui_or_backend` must be a key in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (e.g., 'agg', 'svg', 'nbagg').
    *   For the output to be associated with `null` (None), and knowing the function returns `(backend, gui)`, the `gui` component is likely `None` (headless), or the test harness captures a specific failure or null component. The `nbagg` backend resolves to `('nbagg', 'nbagg')`. The `agg` backend resolves to `('agg', None)` (because 'agg' maps to 'headless', and the code converts 'headless' to `None`).
    *   `"agg"` fits all criteria: it is not a framework name, it is a built-in backend, it does not trigger entry point loading, and it results in a tuple containing `None`.

3.  **State Initialization**:
    *   `_loaded_entry_points`: Default initialization value is `False`. Since entry points weren't loaded (implied by trace), this remains `False`.
    *   `notebook`: The explicit initialization in `__init__` is `self._name_to_module = {'notebook': 'nbagg'}`. So the value for key `"notebook"` is `"nbagg"`.
