The input of the function `_eval_is_extended_real` is predicted to be a `Pow` object where the base is `re(2 + I, evaluate=False)` and the exponent is `2`. This configuration triggers the check for `base.is_extended_positive`, which in turn calls `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative` invoking `evalf`, `Float` comparison, and `as_real_imag` (creating `re` Function structure and evaluating `re`). The presence of `Function.__new__` and `re.eval` in the trace is consistent with the creation and evaluation of the `re` function object, either directly as the base or internally. Since `re(2+I)` simplifies to `2` (Integer) which avoids the complex path, `evaluate=False` is required to force the `Expr` fallback logic observed in the trace.
