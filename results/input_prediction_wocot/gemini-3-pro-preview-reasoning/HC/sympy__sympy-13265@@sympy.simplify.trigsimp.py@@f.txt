Based on the analysis of the code and the provided output, the function `f` inside `exptrigsimp` is designed to simplify expressions of the form involving exponentials into hyperbolic or trigonometric functions. The output `y*tanh(1 + I)` suggests that the input was an exponential form of `tanh(1 + I)` multiplied by `y`.

The exponential definition of `tanh(z)` is `(exp(2z) - 1) / (exp(2z) + 1)`.
Given `z = 1 + I`, we have `2z = 2 + 2I`.
So the exponential form is `(exp(2 + 2*I) - 1) / (exp(2 + 2*I) + 1)`.
Multiplying by `y`, the input `rv` to `f` must have been `y * (exp(2 + 2*I) - 1) / (exp(2 + 2*I) + 1)`.
