For the function `_setup` in class `ContinuousBase`, based on the provided output and code logic:
- The output shows `trans: "log"`, which is a property of `self`. This indicates the input `self` had `trans="log"`.
- The output shows `_tick_params` and `_label_params` fully populated. In the code, these are populated by `new.tick()` and `new.label()` if they are `None` in the copied object. Thus, in the input `self`, they were likely `null`.
- The output shows `values`, `norm`, and `_legend` as `null`, so they are `null` in the input `self`.
- The input `args` contains `data` (a pandas Series) and `prop` (a Property object).
- The series `data` acts as the source for the scale setup. Given `trans="log"`, a standard testing series for such scenarios is `[1, 10, 100]` or `[1, 2, 3]`. We assume a representative series `[1, 10, 100]` with name `"x"`. Use standard pandas `BlockManager` structure for input representation.
- The property `prop` likely corresponds to the x-axis, so `variable` is `"x"`.
