Based on the analysis of the `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` function and the provided output, the function is designed to simplify the arguments of a Piecewise expression, specifically by converting conditions that are redundant (due to previous conditions covering the complement) into `True`.

The output `[(1, x < 0), (3, True)]` indicates that the first condition is kept as is. The second condition `(3, True)` suggests that the original input for the second term was likely the complement of the first condition, which is `x >= 0`. When `x < 0` is already handled, `x >= 0` becomes tautologically true in the `Piecewise` execution flow (or logic simplification), so the function replaces it with `True`.

Given the JSON output format uses strings to represent the `ExprCondPair` objects (e.g., `"(1, x < 0)"`), the input `_args` should be provided in a compatible string format that represents the uncollapsed arguments.
