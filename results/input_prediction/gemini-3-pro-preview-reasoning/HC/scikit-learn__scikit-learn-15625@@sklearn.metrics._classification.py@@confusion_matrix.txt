The function `confusion_matrix` computes a confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification. The output provided is `[[ 9, 0], [ 0, 11]]`.

1.  **Analyze the Output Matrix**:
    *   The matrix is $2 \times 2$, implying a binary classification problem (2 classes).
    *   The diagonal elements are 9 and 11. The element at `[0, 0]` is 9, and at `[1, 1]` is 11.
    *   The off-diagonal elements are 0, which means there are no misclassifications. The predicted labels `y_pred` perfectly match the true labels `y_true`.
    *   The sum of the elements is $9 + 0 + 0 + 11 = 20$, so there are 20 samples in total.

2.  **Determine Labels and Counts**:
    *   By default, `confusion_matrix` sorts the unique labels found in `y_true` and `y_pred`.
    *   Let's assume the standard integer labels `0` and `1`.
    *   The sorted labels would be `[0, 1]`.
    *   The element `cm[0, 0]` corresponds to the label at index 0 (label `0`). Its value is 9. This means there are 9 samples where the true class is `0` and the predicted class is `0`.
    *   The element `cm[1, 1]` corresponds to the label at index 1 (label `1`). Its value is 11. This means there are 11 samples where the true class is `1` and the predicted class is `1`.

3.  **Construct Input Arrays**:
    *   `y_true`: Needs to have nine `0`s and eleven `1`s. Order doesn't strictly matter for the matrix sum, but grouping them is clear. Let's create a list with nine `0`s followed by eleven `1`s.
    *   `y_pred`: Since prediction is perfect (off-diagonals are 0), `y_pred` must be identical to `y_true`.
    *   `y_true = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
    *   `y_pred = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

4.  **Handle `sample_weight`**:
    *   The output values are integers `9` and `11`.
    *   If `sample_weight` were provided, the result data type would depend on the weight types. However, given the simple counts summing to the total number of samples (20), it implies unit weights.
    *   The standard default for `sample_weight` is `None` (which defaults to 1 internally).
    *   In the provided structure, `sample_weight` is a keyword argument. We will set it to `null`.

5.  **Conclusion**:
    *   Arguments `y_true` and `y_pred` are lists of length 20 matching the counts.
    *   `sample_weight` is `null`.
