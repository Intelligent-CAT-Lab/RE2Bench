To predict the input for the `sympify` function that results in the output `"2500/pi"`, we analyze the function's logic and the desired output.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is `"2500/pi"`. In the context of SymPy, this represents a mathematical expression: the integer 2500 divided by the constant $\pi$. The `sympify` function is designed to convert various input types into SymPy expressions.

2.  **Analyze the Code Flow:**
    *   The function checks if the input `a` is already a SymPy object (`__sympy__`), a NumPy instance, or can be coerced into a float/int (if not a string).
    *   If `a` is a string, it skips the numeric coercion block.
    *   There is a critical check:
        ```python
        if strict:
            raise SympifyError(a)
        ```
        This check is executed for strings immediately after skipping the numeric coercion block. It is also executed for non-strings if they weren't returned by coercion logic.
    *   If `strict` is `False`, the code proceeds to string parsing:
        ```python
        expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)
        return expr
        ```
    *   `parse_expr` can convert a string like `"2500/pi"` into the corresponding SymPy expression tree (`Mul(2500, Pow(pi, -1))`).

3.  **Determine Input `a`:**
    *   The most direct source for the expression `"2500/pi"` is the string `"2500/pi"`. Passing this string to `parse_expr` yields the desired symbolic object.
    *   Creating this object from numbers inside `sympify` isn't possible in one go (unless `a` was already the expression object, which is trivial and less likely than the string conversion use-case).
    *   Therefore, `a` is `"2500/pi"`.

4.  **Determine Input `strict`:**
    *   As noted in the code analysis, if `a` is a string and `strict` is `True`, the function raises a `SympifyError` before attempting to parse the string.
    *   For the string `"2500/pi"` to be successfully parsed and returned, `strict` must be `False`.

5.  **Construct Inputs:**
    *   `self`: Empty (function is standalone/static context in snippet).
    *   `args`: `a` = `"2500/pi"`.
    *   `kwargs`: `strict` = `False`.
