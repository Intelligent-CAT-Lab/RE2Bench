To produce the output of two Axes objects, we need to set up `fig` and `layoutgrids` such that:
1.  `fig` contains two axes that participate in the layout.
2.  `layoutgrids` contains the grid specification used by these axes.
3.  We avoid complex margin calculations (which require `margin_vals` arrays) by configuring the axes to span only one column and one row each (simple 1x2 grid). This bypasses the logic inside `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1`.

Running the logic:
1.  `match_submerged_margins` is called.
2.  `fig.subfigs` is set to `[]`, so the recursive loop adds nothing to `axsdone`.
3.  `axs` list is constructed from `fig.get_axes()`. We provide two axes in `fig`.
4.  The loop iterates over these axes.
5.  For each axis, `ss1.get_gridspec()` is called. We set this to return the key "GridSpec(1, 2)".
6.  This key exists in `layoutgrids`, so the axis is processed.
7.  We set `colspan` and `rowspan` to be single-element lists (e.g., `[0]`). Thus, `len(ss1.colspan)` is 1, and the nested loops for margin adjustment are skipped.
8.  The function returns the list of valid axes.
