The given output is `False`.
The method `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative(self, positive)` returns `False` when the extended positivity/negativity condition is not met for a number.
Inside the function:
1. `self.is_number` must be true.
2. `self.evalf(2)` is called to get a numerical approximation `f`.
3. `match = pure_complex(f)` extracts real part `r` and imaginary part `i`.
4. If `match` is valid, it checks: `bool(not i and (r > 0 if positive else r < 0))`.
   - If `positive` is `True`, it returns `True` only if `i` is effectively 0 and `r > 0`.
   - If `positive` is `False`, it returns `True` only if `i` is effectively 0 and `r < 0`.

The output is `False`, so `r > 0` (or `r < 0`) must be false (assuming `i=0`).
We need a number that is neither strictly positive nor strictly negative (or at least fails the specific check).
`0` is the prime candidate: `0 > 0` is False, and `0 < 0` is False.
The trace shows `sympy.sympy.core.numbers._eval_evalf`, `__bool__`, `__gt__`, `__lt__`, which confirms `self` is treated as a number. `__bool__` returning `False` (as seen in the trace snippet for `numbers`) is consistent with `Integer(0)` (which is falsy in Python).
Thus, if `self` is `0` (representing `Integer(0)`) and `positive` is `True` (checking if it is extended positive), the result is `False`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative` returns `False`.
2. This happens if the number is not strictly positive (when `positive=True`) or not strictly negative (when `positive=False`), or if it is complex.
3. The simplest real number satisfying this condition is `0`. `0` is not greater than `0`.
4. The functions called include `sympy.sympy.core.numbers._eval_evalf` and `__bool__`, supporting the use of a simple number like `Integer`.
5. `Integer(0)` results in `r=0.0, i=0`. `r > 0` is False. The method returns `False`.
6. `positive` is typically `True` (default for `is_extended_positive`), so assuming `positive` is `True` aligns with standard usage.
