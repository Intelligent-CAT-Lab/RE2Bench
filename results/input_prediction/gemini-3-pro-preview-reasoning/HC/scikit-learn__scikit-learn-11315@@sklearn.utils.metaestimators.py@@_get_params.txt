To determine the input for `_get_params`, I analyze the provided output, the function definition, and the class structure.

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `{'n_jobs': 1, 'remainder': 'passthrough', 'transformer_weights': null, 'transformers': null}`.
    This dictionary corresponds to the parameters of a `ColumnTransformer` (or similar estimator) instance. The key `transformers` has a value of `null`, which implies in Python the attribute `self.transformers` is `None`.

2.  **Analyze the Function `_get_params`**:
    ```python
    def _get_params(self, attr, deep=True):
        out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)
        if not deep:
            return out
        estimators = getattr(self, attr)
        # ... logic to iterate estimators ...
    ```
    The function first retrieves base parameters using `BaseEstimator.get_params`. If `deep` is `True`, it then attempts to access `attr` on `self` to get a list of estimators and iterate over them.

3.  **Trace Logic**:
    *   The `Functions called during the execution` section lists `_transformers`. The logic for `_transformers` is:
        ```python
        def _transformers(self):
            return [(name, trans) for name, trans, _ in self.transformers]
        ```
    *   If `self.transformers` is `None` (as indicated by the output `transformers: null`), calling `_transformers` would raise a `TypeError` ('NoneType' object is not iterable).
    *   Since the function executed successfully and produced output, the properties accessed must have been valid, OR the execution path causing the error was skipped.
    *   The only way to skip the `_transformers` access (and thus avoid the crash) is if `deep` is set to `False`. The check `if not deep: return out` happens before `getattr(self, attr)`.
    *   Therefore, `deep` must be `False`.

4.  **Determine Input Values**:
    *   **Input `kwargs`**: `deep` is `False`.
    *   **Input `args`**: `attr` is required. For `ColumnTransformer`, the attribute holding the estimator tuples is `_transformers`. Although not used due to `deep=False`, it is the expected argument.
    *   **Input `self`**: The attributes must match the output dictionary because `BaseEstimator.get_params` simply returns attributes matching constructor arguments.
        *   `n_jobs`: 1
        *   `remainder`: "passthrough"
        *   `transformer_weights`: `None` (null)
        *   `transformers`: `None` (null)
        *   `_remainder` and `transformers_`: These are internal/fitted attributes. Since `transformers` is `None` (unfitted state), they are likely `None` or not set. I will use `null` (None) for them.
