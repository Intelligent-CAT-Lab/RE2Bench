The function `_find_reasonable_pivot` aims to find a non-zero element in a column `col` to serve as a pivot. It uses `iszerofunc` to check for zeroness and `simpfunc` to simplify expressions if the first check is inconclusive.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is a tuple `(0, "-9", false, [])`.
    *   Index: `0` (The pivot is at the first position).
    *   Value: `"-9"` (The string representation of the pivot value). This suggests the internal object is `Integer(-9)` (whose string representation is `"-9"`) or `Float(-9.0)` (string `"-9.0"`). Since it is `"-9"`, it is likely `Integer(-9)`.
    *   Assumed Non-zero: `False` (The value was definitely determined to be non-zero).
    *   Newly determined: `[]`.

2.  **Analyze the Execution Trace**:
    *   The function `sympy.matrices.utilities._simplify` is listed in "Functions called during the execution".
    *   The function `sympy.matrices.utilities._iszero` is also listed.
    *   If the input `col` contained a `SymPy` object like `Integer(-9)`, the "Pass 1" check with `_iszero(Integer(-9))` would return `False` immediately, and `_simplify` would **not** be called.
    *   The fact that `_simplify` was called implies that "Pass 1" returned `None` (inconclusive). This happens if the elements in `col` are not native SymPy objects (e.g., Python `int` or `str`), or are unsimplified expressions.
    *   If `col` contained `["-9"]` (a list of strings):
        *   **Check Float/Int**: Strings are not instances of Float/Integer. Check fails.
        *   **Pass 1**: `_iszero("-9")` calls `getattr("-9", 'is_zero', None)`, which returns `None`. `possible_zeros` becomes `[None]`.
        *   **Pass 2**: Iterates `i=0`. `possible_zeros[0]` is `None`. Calls `simped = simpfunc("-9")`.
            *   `_simplify("-9")` converts the string `"-9"` to the SymPy object `Integer(-9)`.
            *   `_iszero(Integer(-9))` returns `False`.
            *   The function returns `(0, Integer(-9), False, [])`.
    *   This path matches the output and explains the presence of `_simplify` in the trace.

3.  **Construct the Input**:
    *   `col`: `["-9"]`. A list containing the string `"-9"`.
    *   `iszerofunc`: The function used was likely `_iszero`. Based on the "Functions called", we can reference it by its fully qualified name `sympy.matrices.utilities._iszero` or simply `_iszero`. Given the explicit nature of these structures, providing the name found in the trace is appropriate.
    *   `simpfunc`: Similarly, `sympy.matrices.utilities._simplify`.

4.  **Final JSON Structure**:
    *   `args` contains `col`, `iszerofunc`, `simpfunc`.
    *   `col` is `["-9"]`.
    *   Function arguments are represented by their names as strings to fit JSON format.
