The output `test_folds` array contains labels `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` which indicates that `n_splits` is 5.
The sequence of fold IDs in the output exhibits a distinct block-like structure with some mixing/noise at the boundaries (e.g., a long sequence of `0`s, then `1`s, etc.). This structure on a sample-by-sample basis (where the first chunk of samples gets fold 0, the next chunk fold 1, etc.) is characteristic of:
1.  `shuffle=False`: If `shuffle` were True, the fold IDs would be randomly distributed across the array.
2.  An interleaved or specific target `y`. If `y` were sorted by class (e.g., `[0...0, 1...1]`), `StratifiedKFold` with `shuffle=False` would produce repeated gradients (e.g., `0,1,2,3,4, 0,1,2,3,4`). The fact that we see a global gradient (`0`s -> `1`s -> `4`s) suggests `y` is distributed in a way that allows the first global chunk of data to satisfy the quota for fold 0 for all classes, or effectively behaves like a single group or balanced interleaved data where quotas fill sequentially. However, the presence of noise (e.g., `...1 0 0 1...`) typically arises from inequalities in class distribution or specific interleaving where one class fills its fold quota slightly before another.

Given the typical context of such inputs in scikit-learn tests/examples using `StratifiedKFold`, and the output size (~150 elements) and values, the input is consistently `n_splits=5` and `shuffle=False`. `X` is provided as a structure mimicking a pandas DataFrame (with `values`, `iloc`, etc.), and `y` is the target array. The data likely comes from a standard dataset (like Iris) or a generated classification problem.
