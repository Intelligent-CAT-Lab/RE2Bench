The user wants to predict the input for the function `add_order` of the class `_ClassBuilder`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Function**: The function `add_order` is a method of `_ClassBuilder`. It calls `_make_order(self._cls, self._attrs)` to create comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__le__`, etc.) and adds them to `self._cls_dict`. It returns `self`.

2.  **Analyze the Output**: The output provided is `{"output": "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>"}`. This is the string representation of the returned `self` object. It confirms that `self._cls` is a class named `A` and that `add_order` executed without raising an exception.

3.  **Analyze the Input Structure**: The input structure asks for the values of `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr` inside the `self` object. Although `_ClassBuilder` stores derived state (like `_attrs`), the structure likely maps to the arguments provided to `__init__` which established the state.

4.  **Deduce Variable Values**:
    *   `these`: This argument is used in `__init__` to manually provide attributes. If `these` is `None` (the default in `attr.s`), the builder scans the class `cls` for attributes. If `these` is a dictionary, it uses those attributes. Since the output is generic and implies a standard class processing flow, and `these` defaults to `None` in the library's usage, `None` (JSON `null`) is the most probable value.
    *   `auto_attribs`: This boolean argument controls whether to scan for type-annotated fields (modern style) or `attr.ib` assignments. The apparent default for `attr.s` is `False`. Since the execution of `add_order` works correctly regardless of how `_attrs` was populated (even if empty, it just generates empty tuple comparisons), we assume the standard default `False`.
    *   `has_custom_setattr`: This boolean indicates if the class has a user-defined `__setattr__`. It affects initialization logic (`on_setattr`) but does not directly impact `add_order`'s logic of adding comparison methods. We assume the default `False`.

5.  **Construct Input**: Based on the defaults and the lack of constraints forcing otherwise:
    *   `auto_attribs`: `False`
    *   `these`: `None`
    *   `has_custom_setattr`: `False`

    In JSON format, `False` is `false` and `None` is `null`.
