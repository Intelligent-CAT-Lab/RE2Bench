Based on the output, the function `diophantine` returned a set containing a single tuple of parametrized solutions:
`{(-8*q**2, 64*p**2 + 16*p*q + q**2, 64*p*q + 8*q**2)}`

1.  **Analyze the Solution Structure:**
    The solution tuple contains three expressions involving parameters `p` and `q`. Let the variables corresponding to these expressions in alphabetical order be $x, y, z$.
    -   $x = -8 q^2$
    -   $y = 64 p^2 + 16 p q + q^2 = (8p + q)^2$
    -   $z = 64 p q + 8 q^2 = 8q(8p + q)$

2.  **Verify the Equation:**
    Let's check for a relationship between $x, y, z$.
    Calculate terms involving squares and products:
    -   $z^2 = (8q(8p+q))^2 = 64 q^2 (8p+q)^2$
    -   $xy = (-8q^2)(8p+q)^2 = -8 q^2 (8p+q)^2$
    -   $y^2$ involves a 4th power of parameters, unlikely to balance $z^2$ directly without other 4th power terms.
    -   Compare $z^2$ and $xy$:
        $z^2 = -8 ( -8 q^2 (8p+q)^2 ) = -8 (xy)$
        $\Rightarrow z^2 = -8xy$
        $\Rightarrow z^2 + 8xy = 0$

    Let's verify:
    $z^2 + 8xy = 64q^2(8p+q)^2 + 8(-8q^2)(8p+q)^2 = 64q^2(8p+q)^2 - 64q^2(8p+q)^2 = 0$.
    The equation is $z^2 + 8xy = 0$.

3.  **Determine Function Arguments:**
    -   **`eq`**: The expression representing the equation is `z**2 + 8*x*y`.
    -   **`param`**: The solution uses parameters `p` and `q`. While the default parameter for `diophantine` is `t` (or `m`, `n` depending on context), for homogeneous ternary quadratic equations, SymPy's solver (`_parametrize_ternary_quadratic`) internally uses `p` and `q` regardless of the `param` argument passed to the main function (as seen in the source logic where `param` is not passed to the ternary solver). Thus, we rely on the default behavior and don't need to specify `param`.
    -   **`syms`**: Not specified, defaults to free symbols `x, y, z` sorted alphabetically.
    -   **`permute`**: The output set contains only one tuple. Since the equation $z^2 + 8xy = 0$ is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, a complete set of solutions (permutations included) would typically include the swapped version $((8p+q)^2, -8q^2, ...)$. Since only one is present, `permute` must be `False` (the default).
