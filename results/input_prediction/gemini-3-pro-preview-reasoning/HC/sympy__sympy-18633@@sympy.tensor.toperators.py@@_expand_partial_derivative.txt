[THOUGHT]
The goal is to determine the input `self` (a `PartialDerivative` object) for the method `_expand_partial_derivative` such that it produces the output `{"_indices": null, "_free": null, "_dum": null}`.

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output indicates that the return value of the function has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes equal to `null` (None). This is characteristic of `S.Zero` (SymPy's scalar zero) when serialized, as `S.Zero` is a singleton number and does not have tensor attributes like `_indices` (unlike `PartialDerivative` or `Tensor` objects which would have lists, even if empty).
2.  **Analyze the Code:**
    In `_expand_partial_derivative`:
    ```python
    args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
    obj = self.func(*args)
    obj._indices = indices
    # ...
    if not args[0].free_symbols:
        return S.Zero
    ```
    The method constructs a partial derivative object `obj` and checks if the expression being differentiated (`args[0]`) contains any free symbols. If `args[0].free_symbols` is empty, it means the expression is constant with respect to the variables, and the function returns `S.Zero`.
3.  **Deduce Logic Trigger:** Since the output corresponds to `S.Zero`, the input `self` must be a `PartialDerivative` where the expression (`self.expr`) has no free symbols (i.e., it represents the derivative of a constant, like a number).
4.  **Reconstruct Input Attributes:**
    If `self` represents a partial derivative of a scalar constant (e.g., `PartialDerivative(1, x)`), it is a scalar tensor expression (rank 0).
    For a scalar expression:
    -   `_indices` is an empty list `[]`.
    -   `_free` (free indices) is an empty list `[]`.
    -   `_dum` (dummy indices) is an empty list `[]`.
    (Note: If the input had non-empty indices, e.g. derivative of a constant tensor, the result would still be `S.Zero` which matches the output, but usually simplest inputs are expected. The empty lists correspond to the scalar case `d(const)/dx`.)

Therefore, the input placeholders `XXX` should be filled with `[]`.
