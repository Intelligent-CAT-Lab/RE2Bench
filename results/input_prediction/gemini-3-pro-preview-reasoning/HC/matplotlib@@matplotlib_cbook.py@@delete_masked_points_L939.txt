[THOUGHT]
1. **Analyze the Function Logic**: The function `delete_masked_points` takes a variable number of arguments (`*args`). It treats the first argument as the reference for the number of records (`nrecs`). It iterates over all arguments: valid sequences (matching `nrecs`) are converted to numpy arrays and checked for validity (finite values, not masked). Non-sequence arguments are passed through. If any valid sequence has invalid points (NaN, Inf, or masked), those indices are removed from all valid sequence arguments.

2. **Analyze the Output**: The output is a JSON object with a key `output` containing a list: `[array_string_1, array_string_2, null]`.
   - `array_string_1`: A string representation of a numpy array containing values from 0.0 to 0.45.
   - `array_string_2`: A string representation of a numpy array containing values from 0.5 to 0.95.
   - `null`: Represents Python's `None`.

3. **Deduce the Input**:
   - The output list has 3 elements, so `*args` must have contained 3 arguments.
   - The third element is `null` (None). Since `None` is not a sequence, the function's logic (`if not isinstance(x, str) and np.iterable(x)...`) skips it for processing/filtering but keeps it in the return list `margs`. Thus, the third input argument was `None`.
   - The first two output elements are arrays of length 10. The values are all finite numbers (0.0 to 0.45 and 0.5 to 0.95).
   - If the original inputs had invalid values, the output arrays would be shorter due to filtering. Since the values are perfect sequences (step 0.05), it is most likely that the inputs were these exact sequences and no filtering occurred.
   - Therefore, the first input argument was a list/array `[0.0, 0.05, ..., 0.45]` and the second was `[0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95]`.

4. **Construct the JSON**:
   - Fill the `args` parameter inside the structure with a list containing the two lists of floats and `null`.
