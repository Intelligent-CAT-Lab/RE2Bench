To predict the input `cls` for the `restify` function that results in the output `":py:obj:`None`"`, I will trace the execution logic:

1.  **Analyze the function Logic**: The function `restify(cls)` checks the type and properties of `cls` to determine the string representation.
2.  **Examine the first condition**:
    ```python
    if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
        return ':py:obj:`None`'
    ```
    If `cls` is `None` or the `NoneType` class, it immediately returns the target output.
3.  **Examine subsequent conditions**:
    *   `elif isinstance(cls, str): return cls`: If the input was the string `":py:obj:`None`"`, it would return it. However, `restify` is designed to convert types to strings, so the primary use case implies passing the object `None` rather than the resulting string.
    *   Other conditions handle `Ellipsis`, builtin classes, `NewType`, `UnionType`, etc., which produce formatted strings involving the class name or module, not `None`.
4.  **Conclusion**: The most direct and logical input to produce `":py:obj:`None`"` is `None`. In JSON format, Python's `None` is represented as `null`.
