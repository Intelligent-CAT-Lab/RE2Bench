The goal is to determine the input for the function `_complement` of the `Set` class (specifically a subclass like `FiniteSet` effectively) given the output.

The function `_complement(self, other)` calculates the set difference `other - self`.

**Step 1: Analyze the Output**
The output given is:
```json
{
    "_elements": "frozenset({1})"
}
```
This indicates that the function returned a `FiniteSet` object whose internal `_elements` attribute is a `frozenset` containing the single element `1`. Thus, the result of the calculation `other - self` is the set `{1}`.

**Step 2: Analyze the Input Structure**
The provided input structure is:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "other": {
            "_elements": XXX
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
- `self`: Represented as `{}`. This implies `self` has no specific internal state set in this test case, effectively acting as an empty set (e.g., `S.EmptySet` or an empty `FiniteSet`). An empty set is disjoint from any other set.
- `other`: We need to fill in `_elements`. Since `other` has `_elements`, it is treated as a `FiniteSet`.

**Step 3: Deduce the arguments**
The logic of `_complement` for a `FiniteSet` `other` iterates through elements of `other` and checks if they are contained in `self`.
`result = {x for x in other if x not in self}` (simplified).

We established:
`result = {1}`
`self = {}` (Empty)

Substituting `self` into the equation:
`other - {} = {1}`
`other = {1}`

So `other` must be a set containing exactly the element `1`.
The internal representation of `other` requires setting `_elements`. To match the format seen in the output (and typical for these serialized Object representations), this should be the string representation of a frozenset containing 1.

Value for `XXX`: `"frozenset({1})"`

[THOUGHT]
The function `_complement(self, other)` calculates `other - self`.
The output shows the result is a `FiniteSet` with `_elements` being `frozenset({1})`. This means the result is `{1}`.
The input structure for `self` is `{}`, which implies `self` is an empty set (or has no elements impacting the operation).
Because `self` is empty, `other - self` simplifies to `other`.
Since the result is `{1}`, `other` must be `{1}`.
`other` is defined by its `_elements` attribute in the structure. To match the output format and defining a set with element 1, the value should be `"frozenset({1})"`.
