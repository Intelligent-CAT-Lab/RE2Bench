To predict the input `exprs` for the function `_parallel_poly_from_expr`, we analyze the function's logic and the provided output.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output**:
    *   The function returns a tuple (simulated as a JSON list).
    *   The first element is a list of polynomials:
        *   `P1`: `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` corresponding to the expression $2$.
        *   `P2`: `Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` corresponding to the expression $-2 \cos(\phi)$.
    *   The second element is an options dictionary `opt`:
        *   `"gens": ["cos(phi)"]`: The generator used is $\cos(\phi)$.
        *   `"domain": "ZZ"`: The coefficients are integers ($2, -2$), so the domain constructed is Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$).
        *   `"polys": false`: This indicates that the input list `exprs` did not contain `Poly` objects (or `opt.polys` was explicitly False, but defaults usually apply). If inputs were `Poly` objects, the code logic would typically result in `polys=True` or take a different branch.

2.  **Reverse Engineering the Input (`exprs`)**:
    *   The function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` iterates over `exprs`, calls `sympify` on them, and then converts them to polynomials sharing the same domain and generators.
    *   Since `polys` is `False` in the output, the inputs were expressions (e.g., `Basic` instances or strings), not `Poly` instances.
    *   The expressions must correspond to the polynomials $2$ and $-2 \cos(\phi)$ respectively.
    *   The generator $\cos(\phi)$ implies one expression contained `cos(phi)` and the other did not introduce new incompatible variables (constant $2$ is compatible).
    *   In a JSON-based input format for SymPy functions, expressions are commonly represented as strings which `sympify` can parse.
    *   Therefore, `exprs` should be a list containing strings representation of these expressions: `["2", "-2*cos(phi)"]`.

3.  **Verifying Constraints**:
    *   If `exprs = ["2", "-2*cos(phi)"]` and `opt = {}`:
        *   `sympify("2")` $\to$ `Integer(2)`.
        *   `sympify("-2*cos(phi)")` $\to$ `Mul(Integer(-2), cos(Symbol('phi')))`.
        *   Neither are `Poly` objects $\to$ `_polys` list is empty.
        *   `_parallel_dict_from_expr` will scan these. It finds generator `cos(phi)`.
        *   Coefficients are $2$ and $-2$. `construct_domain` finds `ZZ`.
        *   Resulting Polys match the output.
        *   `opt.polys` becomes `False` (boolean of empty `_polys`). Matches output.

4.  **Filling `XXX`**:
    *   The structure provided requires `exprs` to be filled.
    *   Value: `["2", "-2*cos(phi)"]`.
