1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output describes a SciPy CSR matrix with shape `(1, 5)`, `indices` `[2, 4]`, and `indptr` `[0, 2]`. This means there is 1 sample (row), and the resulting one-hot encoding has 5 dimensions. The row has non-zero values (1s) at columns 2 and 4.

2.  **Determine Input Dimensions**: Since there are 2 non-zero entries in the output for a single sample, and `OneHotEncoder` produces exactly one active bit per input feature, the input `X` must have 2 features.

3.  **Determine `n_values` and `active_features_`**:
    *   The structure contains `active_features_`, which implies `n_values='auto'` (as `active_features_` is only set when `n_values` is 'auto' or array of such).
    *   The output shape is 5. If `active_features_` maps the internal representation to the output, and we see indices 2 and 4, the simplest consistent configuration for `n_values='auto'` producing a 5-column output is that all 5 potential columns are active. Thus `active_features_` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    *   We need to partition the 5 discrete values into 2 features.
    *   Let `n_values_` be `[n1, n2]`. `n1 + n2 = 5`.
    *   Feature 0 maps to indices `[0, n1)`.
    *   Feature 1 maps to indices `[n1, n1+n2)`.
    *   We have output indices 2 and 4.
    *   If `n1=3`, `n2=2`:
        *   Feature 0 range `[0, 3)`. Index 2 is in this range. Value = `2 - 0 = 2`.
        *   Feature 1 range `[3, 5)`. Index 4 is in this range. Value = `4 - 3 = 1`.
        *   This works. `X` would be `[[2, 1]]`.
    *   If `n1=2`, `n2=3`:
        *   Feature 0 range `[0, 2)`. Neither 2 nor 4 is in this range. This would imply Feature 0 has no active bit, which is impossible for standard `OneHotEncoder` without missing values (and checks usually fail or drop rows, but shape is fixed). So this is invalid.
    *   Thus, `n_values_` is `[3, 2]`.
    *   `feature_indices_` is `[0, 3, 5]`.

4.  **Determine `X`**:
    *   Based on `n_values_=[3, 2]`, Feature 0 value is 2, Feature 1 value is 1.
    *   `X = [[2, 1]]`.

5.  **Fill `self` attributes**:
    *   `n_values`: `'auto'`.
    *   `categorical_features`: `'all'` (default).
    *   `dtype`: The structure requires filling fields for the `dtype` object (`np.float64`). Since these are properties of the type class and do not affect the control flow logic (other than `dtype` being passed to matrix constructor), and typically aren't manually set, I will ignore their detailed values and use `null` or simple strings, as they are likely artifacts of the serializer used in the prompt generation.
    *   `sparse`: `True`.
    *   `handle_unknown`: `'error'` (default).

6.  **Construct JSON**: maintaining the provided structure.
