The code snippet performs the following operations:
1. reads a line of input.
2. splits the line into two parts and converts them to integers `t` and `h`.
3. calculates the value `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.
4. prints the calculated value.

The expected output is `2`.
So, the equation to solve is:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`

Subtracting 1 from both sides:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`

This integer division result implies that the numerator is at least equal to the denominator but strictly less than twice the denominator (assuming the denominator is positive).
Let `D = t - 1` and `N = h - 2`.
We require `D > 0` (so `t > 1`) and `D <= N < 2 * D`.
Substituting back variables:
`t - 1 <= h - 2 < 2 * (t - 1)`

Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality:
`t + 1 <= h < 2t`

We can pick any integer `t` greater than 1 to find a corresponding integer `h`.
Let's choose a small value for `t`, say `t = 2`.
Inequality becomes:
`2 + 1 <= h < 2 * 2`
`3 <= h < 4`
The only integer `h` that satisfies this is `h = 3`.

Verification:
If `t = 2` and `h = 3`:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`
`= (3 - 2) // (2 - 1) + 1`
`= 1 // 1 + 1`
`= 1 + 1`
`= 2`
This matches the expected output.
Thus, the input string "2 3" is valid.
