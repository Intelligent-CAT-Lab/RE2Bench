The code reads an integer `N`.
If `N` is even, it prints `0.5`.
If `N` is odd, it prints the result of `(N + 1) / N / 2`.
The given output is `0.5050505050505051`.
Since `0.5050505050505051` is not `0.5`, `N` must be odd.
The expression `(N + 1) / N / 2` is equivalent to $\frac{N+1}{2N} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2N} = 0.5 + \frac{0.5}{N}$.
Setting up the equation based on the output:
$0.5 + \frac{0.5}{N} \approx 0.5050505050505051$
$\frac{0.5}{N} \approx 0.0050505050505051$
$N \approx \frac{0.5}{0.0050505050505051} \approx 99$
Let's verify with `N = 99`:
It is odd.
The calculation is `(99 + 1) / 99 / 2` = `100 / 198` = `50 / 99`.
$50 / 99 = 0.\overline{50}$.
In double-precision floating-point arithmetic (used by Python), `50/99` is represented as `0.5050505050505051`.
This matches the output.
Thus, the input is `99`.
