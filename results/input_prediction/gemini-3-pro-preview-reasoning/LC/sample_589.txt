The function `f(num)` takes a list `num` as input, gets the last element of that list (`num[-1]`), and appends it to the end of the list. Then it returns the modified list.

Given the output `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`:
1.  The list has 5 elements. The last operation performed was `num.append(num[-1])`.
2.  This means the last element `1` is a duplicate of the element that was at the end of the list before the append operation.
3.  The element at index 3 (second to last) is `1`.
4.  To get the input, we reverse the append operation by removing the last element.
5.  Therefore, the input list `num` was `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`.
