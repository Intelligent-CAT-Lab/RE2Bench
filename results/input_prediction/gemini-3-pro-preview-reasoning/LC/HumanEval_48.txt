[THOUGHT]
The function `is_palindrome` iterates through the provided string `text`. It compares the character at index `i` with the character at the mirrored position `len(text) - 1 - i`. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns `False`. Only if the loop completes without finding mismatches does it return `True`.

The expected output is `False`. This means the input string `text` must *not* be a palindrome. I need to select a string where at least one character differs from its symmetric counterpart.

Let's choose the string "hello".
1. `len("hello")` is 5.
2. The loop starts at `i = 0`.
3. Comparison: `text[0]` ('h') != `text[5 - 1 - 0]` ('o').
4. The characters are different, so the function returns `False` immediately.

Any non-palindrome string would work (e.g., "ab", "test", "openai"). I will selection "hello" as a representative example.
