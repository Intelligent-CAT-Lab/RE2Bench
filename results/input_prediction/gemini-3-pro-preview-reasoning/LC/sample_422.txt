[THOUGHT]
The function `f` performs the following operations on the input `array`:
1. It creates a copy of `array`.
2. It reverses the order of elements in the copy.
3. It iterates through the reversed array, squaring each element (`x * x`), and returns the resulting list.

Given the output `[1, 4, 1]`:
1. The elements of the resulting list correspond to the squares of the elements in the reversed input array.
2. Therefore, the reversed array contained elements $x, y, z$ such that $x^2 = 1$, $y^2 = 4$, and $z^2 = 1$.
3. Solving for the values, we get magnitudes of $1, 2, 1$. Assuming the simplest case of positive integers, the reversed array was `[1, 2, 1]`.
4. Since the function processed the array in reversed order, the original input `array` must be the reverse of `[1, 2, 1]`.
5. Reversing `[1, 2, 1]` results in `[1, 2, 1]`.

Thus, the predicted input is `[1, 2, 1]`.
