[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers from a single line of input, assigning them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
It then calculates four products: `a * c`, `a * d`, `b * c`, and `b * d`.
The maximum of these four products is printed as the answer.
The provided output is `56183721947132200`.
To reverse engineer the input, we need to find four integers such that at least one of their pairwise products equals `56183721947132200`, and none of the other products exceed this value.

We can simplify the problem by setting `a = 56183721947132200` and `c = 1`.
Thus, `a * c` will be `56183721947132200`.
To ensure this is the maximum, we can set `b = 0` and `d = 0`.
Let's verify the products:
- `a * c = 56183721947132200 * 1 = 56183721947132200`
- `a * d = 56183721947132200 * 0 = 0`
- `b * c = 0 * 1 = 0`
- `b * d = 0 * 0 = 0`
The maximum is indeed `56183721947132200`.

The input string consists of these four numbers separated by spaces.
