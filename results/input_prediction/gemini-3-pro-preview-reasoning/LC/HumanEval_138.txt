The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` simply checks whether the input integer `n` satisfies two conditions simultaneously: it must be even (`n % 2 == 0`) and it must be greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`). Since the desired output is `True`, I need to find a value for `n` that makes both expressions true.

1.  **Check Evenness**: `n % 2 == 0` implies `n` is an even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).
2.  **Check Magnitude**: `n >= 8` implies `n` must be 8 or larger.

Combining these, any even integer greater than or equal to 8 is a valid input. The smallest such integer is 8.

Verification:
- If `n = 8`: `8 % 2 == 0` is `True` and `8 >= 8` is `True`. Result is `True`.
- If `n = 10`: `10 % 2 == 0` is `True` and `10 >= 8` is `True`. Result is `True`.

I will use `8` as the input.
