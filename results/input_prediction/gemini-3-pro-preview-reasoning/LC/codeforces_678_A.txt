[THOUGHT]
The Python code performs the following operations:
1.  Reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and converts the parts to integers. These are assigned to `vamshi` and `z`.
2.  Computes the expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`. Here `//` is integer division.
3.  Prints the result.

We are given the output `15`. We need to find input values `vamshi` and `z` such that:
$$(vamshi // z + 1) \times z = 15$$

For this equation to hold with integer arithmetic:
1.  $z$ must be a factor of 15. The positive factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.
2.  The term $(vamshi // z + 1)$ must equal $15 / z$.

Let's test possible values for $z$:
*   **Case $z = 3$**:
    *   $15 / 3 = 5$.
    *   So, $(vamshi // 3 + 1) = 5 \implies vamshi // 3 = 4$.
    *   This means $vamshi$ must be in the range $[3 \times 4, 3 \times 5)$, usually written as $12 \le vamshi < 15$.
    *   We can choose $vamshi = 12$.
    *   Verification: $(12 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (4 + 1) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15$. Correct.

*   **Case $z = 5$**:
    *   $15 / 5 = 3$.
    *   So, $(vamshi // 5 + 1) = 3 \implies vamshi // 5 = 2$.
    *   This means $vamshi$ must be in the range $[5 \times 2, 5 \times 3)$, or $10 \le vamshi < 15$.
    *   We can choose $vamshi = 10$.
    *   Verification: $(10 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (2 + 1) * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15$. Correct.

We can select the pair `vamshi = 12` and `z = 3`. The input format expects these two numbers separated by a space on a single line.
