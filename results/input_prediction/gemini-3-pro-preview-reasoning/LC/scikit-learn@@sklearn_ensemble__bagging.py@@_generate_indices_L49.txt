1.  **Analyze the function**: `_generate_indices(random_state, bootstrap, n_population, n_samples)` generates a list of indices.
    *   If `bootstrap` is `True`, it uses `random_state.randint`. This implies `random_state` must be an object with a `.randint` method (like `numpy.random.RandomState`). It does *not* call `check_random_state` in this branch.
    *   If `bootstrap` is `False`, it calls `sample_without_replacement`. The problem description lists `check_random_state` as a function called during execution. `sample_without_replacement` typically calls `check_random_state` to convert an integer/None seed into a `RandomState` object.
2.  **Deduce `bootstrap`**: Since `check_random_state` is listed as "Functions called during the execution", the execution path must have gone through `sample_without_replacement`. Thus, `bootstrap` must be `False`. Furthermore, providing a `RandomState` object in a JSON input is not standard; usually, integers are provided which are converted by `check_random_state`. This reinforces `bootstrap=False`.
3.  **Analyze the output**: The output is `{"output": [0]}`.
    *   The output is a list containing a single integer `0`.
    *   Since the length of the output list is 1, `n_samples` must be `1`.
    *   The value is `0`. The indices generated are in the range `[0, n_population)`.
4.  **Deduce `n_population`**: The index `0` must be valid. So `n_population` must be at least `1`. To deterministically get `[0]` regardless of the random seed (mostly), `n_population` should be `1`. If `n_population` were larger (e.g., 2), `sample_without_replacement` would return either `0` or `1` depending on `random_state`. To ensure the "input" prediction is correct for the given "output", the most logical constraint is `n_population=1`, which limits the pool to just `[0]`.
5.  **Deduce `random_state`**: With `bootstrap=False`, `random_state` can be an integer. `0` is a standard convention for tests. Even if it's `42` or `None`, with `n_population=1` and `n_samples=1`, the result is `[0]`. `0` is the safest guess.

**Conclusion**:
*   `bootstrap`: `False` (JSON `false`)
*   `n_samples`: `1`
*   `n_population`: `1`
*   `random_state`: `0`
