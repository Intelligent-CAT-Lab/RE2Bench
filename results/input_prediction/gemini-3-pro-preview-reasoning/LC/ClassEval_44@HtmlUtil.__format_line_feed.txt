[THOUGHT]
The function `__format_line_feed` takes a string `text` as input.
It uses `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)` to perform a substitution.
The regular expression `\\n+` (which compiles to match one or more newline characters) is replaced by a single newline character `\n`.
Effectively, this function collapses multiple consecutive newlines into a single newline. It preserves single newlines.

We are given the output: `"Some sentence here."`.
We analyze this output string:
1. It does not contain any newline characters (`\n`).
2. It is a simple single-line string.

We reason backwards to the input:
- If the input `text` contained any sequence of newlines (e.g., `"A\n\nB"`), the output would contain single newlines (e.g., `"A\nB"`).
- Since the provided output does not contain any newlines, the input `text` could not have contained any newlines (neither single nor multiple), because the substitution replaces newlines with a newline, it does not remove them.
- Therefore, the transformation `re.sub` effectively seemingly did nothing or the input was already in the desired format without any `\n`.
- The most straightforward and likely input that results in `"Some sentence here."` is the string `"Some sentence here."` itself.

Therefore, the input `text` is `"Some sentence here."`.
