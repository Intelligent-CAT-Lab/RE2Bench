[THOUGHT]
The function `change_base` converts an integer `x` into a string representation in a given `base`. The algorithm repeatedly takes the modulus of `x` with `base` to get the current digit and divides `x` by `base` to move to the next position.

The provided output is `"4"`.
1. Since the output is not an empty string, `x` must be initially greater than 0.
2. The output string has length 1. This implies the loop `while x > 0` executed exactly once. If it executed more than once, digits would be accumulated.
3. For the loop to execute only once, after the first iteration, the new value of `x` (calculated as `x // base`) must be 0. This implies that the initial `x` must be strictly less than `base`.
4. In the single iteration, the character added to `ret` is `str(x % base)`. Since `x < base`, `x % base` equals `x`. Therefore, `str(x)` must be `"4"`. This sets `x = 4`.
5. Since `x < base`, we must have `4 < base`. The base can be any integer greater than or equal to 5.
6. Choosing standard decimal representation, we can set `base = 10`.

Verification:
If `x = 4` and `base = 10`:
- `4 > 0` is true. Enter loop.
- `ret = str(4 % 10) + ''` -> `ret = "4"`.
- `x = 4 // 10` -> `x = 0`.
- Loop condition `0 > 0` is false. Exit loop.
- Return `"4"`. Matches output.
