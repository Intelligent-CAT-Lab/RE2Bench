The function `digitSum` computes the sum of the ASCII values (`ord(char)`) of all uppercase letters in the input string `s`. Non-uppercase characters contribute 0.
The target output is 327. We need to construct a string `s` composed of uppercase letters whose ASCII values sum to 327.
The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, and for 'Z' is 90.

Let's estimate the number of characters needed:
- If we use 3 characters, the maximum possible sum is $3 \times 90 = 270$, which is less than 327.
- If we use 4 characters, the minimum sum is $4 \times 65 = 260$ and the maximum is $4 \times 90 = 360$. This is a valid range.
- If we use 5 characters, the minimum sum is $5 \times 65 = 325$. Since 327 is very close to 325, this is a convenient choice.

Using 5 characters:
The base sum for five 'A's is $5 \times 65 = 325$.
We need a total of 327. The difference is $327 - 325 = 2$.
We can achieve this by taking 4 'A's and increasing the 5th character by 2.
$65 + 2 = 67$, which corresponds to the character 'C'.
So, a string containing four 'A's and one 'C' will work.
Verification: 'A' (65) + 'A' (65) + 'A' (65) + 'A' (65) + 'C' (67) = 260 + 67 = 327.
