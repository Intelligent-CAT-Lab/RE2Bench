The function `greatest_common_divisor` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly replaces `(a, b)` with `(b, a % b)` untill `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the GCD.

The output is provided as `5`. This means we need to find two integers `a` and `b` such that their GCD is 5.

[THOUGHT]
The function implements the Euclidean algorithm for GCD.
Result `a` is returned when `b` becomes 0.
We need `GCD(a, b) == 5`.
There are infinitely many pairs satisfying this (e.g., (5, 5), (5, 10), (10, 5), (15, 5), (15, 10)).
Let's select `a = 10` and `b = 5`.

Simulation trace:
1. Initial state: `a = 10`, `b = 5`.
2. `while b:` (5 is True).
3. Tuple assignment: `a` becomes current `b` (5). `b` becomes current `a % b` (10 % 5 = 0).
4. New state: `a = 5`, `b = 0`.
5. `while b:` (0 is False).
6. Return `a` (5).

This matches the output.
