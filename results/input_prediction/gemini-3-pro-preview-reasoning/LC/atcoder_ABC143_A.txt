The code snippet reads two integers, A and B, calculates `A - 2 * B`, and prints the result, with a lower bound of 0 (values less than 0 become 0). 

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the code**:
    *   `A, B = map(int, input().split())`: Reads two integers from a single line.
    *   `ans = A - 2 * B`: Calculates the difference between A and twice B.
    *   `if ans < 0: ans = 0`: If the result is negative, it sets it to 0.
    *   `print(ans)`: Prints the result.

2.  **Analyze the objective**:
    *   Target output is `0`.
    *   This output can happen in two scenarios:
        a.  Mathematically, $A - 2B = 0 \implies A = 2B$.
        b.  Mathematically, $A - 2B < 0 \implies A < 2B$.
    *   Combining these, any input where $A \le 2B$ is valid.

3.  **Construct Input**:
    *   I need to choose two integers $A$ and $B$ that satisfy $A \le 2B$.
    *   Let's pick a case where $A = 2B$.
    *   If $B = 5$, then $A = 2 * 5 = 10$.
    *   Check: $10 - 2(5) = 10 - 10 = 0$. Output is 0. Matches.
    *   Input string format: `"10 5"`.

4.  **Final Verification**:
    *   Input: `"10 5"`
    *   A = 10, B = 5
    *   ans = 10 - 10 = 0
    *   ans is not < 0
    *   print(0)
    *   Matches required output.
