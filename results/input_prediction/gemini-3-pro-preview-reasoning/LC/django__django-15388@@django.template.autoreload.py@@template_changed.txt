[THOUGHT]
The function `template_changed` returns `True` if two conditions are met:
1. `file_path.suffix` is not `.py`.
2. `file_path` is located within one of the directories returned by `get_template_directories()`.

The function `get_template_directories` resolves template directories to absolute paths using `Path.cwd()`. To produce the output `{"output": true}`, the input `file_path` must be an absolute path that is a child of one of the configured template directories (e.g., `/app/templates` or `/templates`) and must have a non-Python extension (e.g., `.html`).
The `sender` argument is unused in the function logic, so `null` (None) is a suitable value.
Assuming a standard mocked environment where a generic directory like `/templates` is returned by `get_template_directories`, a file path like `/templates/index.html` effectively satisfies the conditions.
