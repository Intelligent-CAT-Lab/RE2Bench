[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern` is a method of the `RegexUtils` class.
Looking at the function signature `def generate_email_pattern(self):`, it takes no parameters other than `self`.
The body of the function assigns a hardcoded regular expression string to the variable `pattern` and returns it.
The provided output matches this hardcoded string exactly.
Since the function accepts no arguments, the `args` and `kwargs` sections in the input structure should be empty.
The `self` object does not require any specific state initialization because the method does not access any instance attributes.
Therefore, the input structure remains empty as provided in the template.
