The function `compare(game, guess)` computes the absolute difference between elements of two iterables `game` and `guess` at corresponding indices.
The output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`. This means the function produced a list of length 4.
This implies `game` and `guess` are iterables (likely lists) of at least length 4.
The relationship for each index `i` is `abs(game[i] - guess[i]) == output[i]`.

We have the following equations:
1. `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`
2. `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0`
3. `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0`
4. `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`

There are infinite integer solutions. We will construct a valid one.
Let's arbitrarily choose `guess` to be `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.
- For index 0: `abs(game[0] - 2) = 2` implies `game[0]` can be `4` or `0`. Let's choose `4`.
- For index 1: `abs(game[1] - 2) = 0` implies `game[1] = 2`.
- For index 2: `abs(game[2] - 2) = 0` implies `game[2] = 2`.
- For index 3: `abs(game[3] - 2) = 1` implies `game[3]` can be `3` or `1`. Let's choose `3`.

So, `game = [4, 2, 2, 3]` and `guess = [2, 2, 2, 2]` is a valid input pair.
