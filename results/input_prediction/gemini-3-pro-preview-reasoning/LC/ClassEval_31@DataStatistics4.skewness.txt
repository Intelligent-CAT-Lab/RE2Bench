The function `skewness` calculates the statistical skewness of a dataset `data`.
The code computes the sample skewness using the formula that involves the sum of cubed deviations from the mean: $\sum (x - \bar{x})^3$.
The output is `0`.
The result of the function is `0` (or `0.0`) in two main cases:
1. The standard deviation is 0 (handled by `if std_deviation != 0 else 0`). This happens if all elements in `data` are identical (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`).
2. The calculated skewness is 0. This happens if the numerator $\sum (x - \bar{x})^3$ is 0. This sum is 0 for any distribution that is perfectly symmetric around its mean (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).

Constraint Analysis:
- The formula involves division by `(n - 1) * (n - 2)`. This implies that for the calculation to proceed (i.e., when `std_deviation != 0`), the length of `data` ($n$) must be greater than 2 to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If we choose a symmetric distribution like `[1, 2, 3]`:
  - $n = 3$.
  - Mean = 2.0.
  - Variance calculated with $n=3$ is $(1+0+1)/3 = 2/3$.
  - Standard deviation is non-zero.
  - Numerator: $(1-2)^3 + (2-2)^3 + (3-2)^3 = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0$.
  - Result is $0.0$.
- Although the output shows integer `0`, `0.0` is mathematically equivalent, and standard testing inputs for skewness typically involve symmetric non-constant lists. `[1, 2, 3]` is the simplest valid symmetric input with $n > 2$.

Input Selection:
`[1, 2, 3]` is a clear, minimal, and valid dataset that results in a skewness of 0 due to symmetry.
