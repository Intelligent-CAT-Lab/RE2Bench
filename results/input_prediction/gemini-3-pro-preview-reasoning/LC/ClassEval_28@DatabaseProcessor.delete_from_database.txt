The function `delete_from_database` executes a SQL `DELETE` operation on a SQLite database. It performs the following steps:
1.  Connects to the database specified by `self.database_name`.
2.  Creates a cursor.
3.  Executes a query `DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?` using the parameters `table_name` for the table and `name` for the value to match.
4.  Commits the transaction.
5.  Closes the connection.
6.  Implicitly returns `None` (as there is no return statement).

The provided output is `{"output": null}`, which corresponds to the Python `None` return value. Because the function's return value does not depend on the content of the inputs (it only indicates completion), and the function causes a side effect (deletion) rather than a data transformation, it is impossible to deduce the *exact* original input strings from the output alone. Any valid combination of string inputs for `database_name`, `table_name`, and `name` (assuming the database and table exist to prevent an `OperationalError`) would result in this output.

Therefore, we verify that the code executes successfully with plausible, syntactically correct inputs typical for such a method. We will simulate the execution with a standard example context.

[THOUGHT]
The Code defines a class `DatabaseProcessor` with a method `delete_from_database` that deletes a record from a SQLite table.
The method returns `None` upon completion.
The Output provided is `null` (None), indicating the function ran without error.
Since the output is constant regardless of the specific input values (as long as they are valid), I must provide a set of plausible inputs that allow the code to run.
I will assume a common testing scenario:
- `self.database_name`: "test.db"
- `table_name`: "users"
- `name`: "Alice"
Execution trace with these inputs:
1. `conn = sqlite3.connect("test.db")` -> Success (creates file if missing).
2. `cursor = conn.cursor()` -> Success.
3. `cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ?", ("Alice",))` -> Success (assuming table 'users' exists; otherwise would raise Error, but output implies success).
4. `conn.commit()` -> Success.
5. `conn.close()` -> Success.
6. Returns `None`.
This matches the provided output.
