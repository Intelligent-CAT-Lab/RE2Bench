[THOUGHT]
The function `__pow__(self, n)` computes the power of a permutation. It performs the following steps:
1. Checks if `n` is a `Permutation` (raises error if so).
2. Converts `n` to an integer using `int(n)`. The execution trace shows `sympy.core.numbers.Integer.__int__` was called, which confirms `n` was passed as a SymPy Integer object (or similar) that delegates `__int__` to return its value. In the JSON input, we represent this simply as the integer value.
3. Accesses `self.array_form` to get the list representation of the permutation.
4. Calls `_af_pow(self.array_form, n)` which calculates the power of the permutation in array form. This operation usually returns a list representing the permuted elements. Raising a permutation to a power (like squaring it) preserves the domain size (the number of elements it acts on).
5. Calls `self._af_new(...)` with the result to create and return a new `Permutation` instance.

The provided output is:
```json
{
    "_array_form": null,
    "_size": 7
}
```
The output indicates the resulting permutation has a `_size` of 7. Since `_af_pow` preserves the size of the permutation array, the input permutation `self` must also have a size of 7.

Therefore, `self` must be defined with:
- `_size`: 7
- `_array_form`: A list of length 7 containing a permutation of 0..6. The simplest case is the identity permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- `_cyclic_form`: Can be `null` (None) since we are providing the array form.

For the argument `n`, any integer is valid resulting in a permutation of the same size. The value `2` is a reasonable choice to represent a squaring operation, consistent with the `__int__` call trace. The fact that `_array_form` is `null` in the output is likely a specific behavior of the object serialization or test case setup, but it does not change the requirement that the input size must be 7 to result in an output size of 7.
