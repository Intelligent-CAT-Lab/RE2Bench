[THOUGHT]
The function `withdraw_resume` takes a `resume` argument and removes it from the `self.resumes` list using `self.resumes.remove(resume)`.
The output is `null` (None in Python), which is the standard return value of a successful execution of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything (and `list.remove` modifies the list in-place and returns `None`).
For the code to execute successfully (without raising a `ValueError`), the `resume` object passed as an argument must be present within the `self.resumes` list.
Therefore, I need to construct a `resume` object (following the structure provided with name, skills, and experience) and ensure that `self.resumes` is a list containing an identical object. `self.job_listings` is not used but part of the structure, so I will initialize it as an empty list or with dummy data. I will choose a sample resume for "Alice" with some skills and experience.

Input construction:
1. `args.resume`: An object `{"name": "Alice", "skills": ["Python"], "experience": "3 years"}`.
2. `self.resumes`: A list containing the above object, e.g., `[{"name": "Alice", "skills": ["Python"], "experience": "3 years"}]`.
3. `self.job_listings`: `[]`.
