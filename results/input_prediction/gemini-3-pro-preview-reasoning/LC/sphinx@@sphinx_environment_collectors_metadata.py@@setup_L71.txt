[THOUGHT]
The function `setup` takes a `Sphinx` application object `app` as an argument.
Inside the function, the method `app.add_env_collector` is called to register `MetadataCollector`.
Finally, the function returns a static dictionary containing extension metadata: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.

The provided `[OUTPUT]` matches this return value exactly.
Unlike the example provided where the output path depended heavily on the input string properties, here the output is constant regardless of the input `app`'s state, as long as `app` supports the `add_env_collector` method.
In the context of serialized execution traces (like the one shown in the example's `_trace` argument which was `{}`), objects or mocks that are passed as arguments but whose internal state isn't specifically mutated or read in a way that affects the serializable return value are typically represented as empty dictionaries `{}` (representing a Mock object or a generic instance).

Therefore, the input `app` is represented as `{}`.
