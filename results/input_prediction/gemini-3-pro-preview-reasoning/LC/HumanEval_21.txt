The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers (floats), calculates the minimum and maximum values in that list, and then transforms each number $x$ using the formula:
$$ \text{scaled\_x} = \frac{x - \min}{\max - \min} $$
This transformation maps the minimum value to 0.0 and the maximum value to 1.0, with other values scaled linearly in between (Min-Max normalization).

The provided output is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.
Properties of the output:
1. It contains 5 elements. Therefore, the input list `numbers` must also contain 5 elements.
2. The values are sorted in ascending order from 0.0 to 1.0. This implies the input list was also sorted in ascending order (since the scaling factor $\frac{1}{\max - \min}$ is positive).
3. The values increase by a constant step of 0.25. $0.0 \to 0.25 \to 0.5 \to 0.75 \to 1.0$. This implies the input values formed an arithmetic progression.

We need to find an input list $[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5]$ such that:
- $x_1 = \min$
- $x_5 = \max$
- The normalized values match the output.

There are infinitely many such lists (any arithmetic progression of length 5). Examples include:
- `[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]` (Min=0, Max=4, Range=4. Check: $1/4=0.25$, etc.)
- `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` (Min=1, Max=5, Range=4. Check: $(2-1)/4=0.25$, etc.)
- `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]` (Input equals Output)

In the context of programming problems and test cases (specifically this function is similar to Problem 21 from the HumanEval dataset), a standard example input used to demonstrate this behavior is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`. It is a simple, increasing sequence of natural numbers (as floats).

Let's verify `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`:
- Min = 1.0
- Max = 5.0
- Denominator = 4.0
- Output:
  - $(1.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.0$
  - $(2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.25$
  - $(3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.5$
  - $(4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.75$
  - $(5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 1.0$
 This matches the output perfectly.
