[THOUGHT]
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` and computes the sum of the squares of the elements `i` that satisfy three conditions:
1. `i > 0`: The number must be strictly positive.
2. `i % 2 != 0`: The number must be odd.
3. `'.' not in str(i)`: The number's string representation must not contain a decimal point (this effectively restricts the input to integers, filtering out floats like `3.0`).

The logic creates a list of squared values for items satisfying these conditions and then sums them up.
If any number enters the summation, it contributes a value `i**2`. Since `i > 0`, `i**2 > 0`. A sum of positive numbers can only be 0 if the set of numbers being summed is empty.
Therefore, for the output to be `0`, the list comprehension must yield an empty list. This means the input `lst` must not contain any positive odd integers.

There are many possible inputs that satisfy this (e.g., `[]`, `[0]`, `[-1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, `[1.1]`). The simplest and most direct input that yields a sum of 0 is an empty list `[]`.
