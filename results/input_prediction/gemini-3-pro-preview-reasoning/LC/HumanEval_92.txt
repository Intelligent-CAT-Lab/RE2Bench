[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int(x, y, z)` returns `True` only if two conditions are met:
1. All arguments `x`, `y`, and `z` must be instances of the `int` class.
2. The sum of two of the arguments must equal the third argument (i.e., `x + y == z` OR `x + z == y` OR `y + z == x`).

To generate an input that results in `True`, I need to select three integers that satisfy the arithmetic relationship.
Arbitrarily picking values:
Let `x = 1` and `y = 2`.
To satisfy `x + y == z`, `z` must be `1 + 2 = 3`.

Verification:
- `isinstance(1, int)` is True.
- `isinstance(2, int)` is True.
- `isinstance(3, int)` is True.
- `1 + 2 == 3` matches the first condition (`x + y == z`).
- The function returns `True`.

Therefore, `x=1`, `y=2`, `z=3` is a valid input.
