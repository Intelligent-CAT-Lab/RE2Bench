The function `f(text)` iterates through the input `text`, filters out any characters that are not numeric (`str.isnumeric`), and joins the remaining characters into a single string. 
For the output to be `"123314"`, the sequence of numeric characters found in the input `text` must correspond exactly to `'1', '2', '3', '3', '1', '4'`.
Any non-numeric characters in the input would be ignored.
Therefore, the simplest input that produces this output is the string `"123314"` itself.
