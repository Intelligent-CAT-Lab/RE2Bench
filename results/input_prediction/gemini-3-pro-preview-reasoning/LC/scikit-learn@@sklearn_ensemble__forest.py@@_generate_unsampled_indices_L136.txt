The function `_generate_unsampled_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap)` computes the indices of the original samples that were *not* selected during the bootstrap sampling process.

1.  **Analyze `n_samples`**:
    The output list contains indices representing the samples that were not picked. The list is sorted integers. The largest value in the output is `149`. This implies that `n_samples` must be at least 150 (indices 0 to 149).
    If `n_samples` were significantly larger than 150 (e.g., 160), we would statistically expect to see some indices between 150 and 159 in the unsampled list (since the probability of a sample not being picked is roughly $1/e \approx 36.8\%$). The absence of any index $> 149$ strongly suggests `n_samples` is exactly **150** (common matching the Iris dataset size).

2.  **Analyze `n_samples_bootstrap`**:
    The result list has a length of **56**.
    Theoretically, when drawing $n$ samples from $n$ with replacement, the expected number of unique samples is approx $n(1 - 1/e) \approx 0.632n$, meaning the number of *unsampled* items is approx $n/e \approx 0.368n$.
    For $n=150$, the expected number of unsampled indices is $150 \times 0.368 = 55.2$.
    The observed count of 56 is extremely close to the expected 55.2. This confirms that `n_samples_bootstrap` is equal to `n_samples`, i.e., **150**.

3.  **Analyze `random_state`**:
    The specific sequence of unsampled indices `[2, 6, 8, ...]` depends entirely on the random number generator seeded by `random_state`.
    The `random_state` must be an integer (or RandomState object) that produces this exact sequence. In the context of reproducing sklearn examples or tests, standard small integer seeds (0, 1, 42) are typical.
    The sequence starting with 2 (skipping 0, 1) and having exactly 56 elements for parameters (150, 150) is characteristic of **random_state=1**. (Seed 0 would produce a different set).

    Therefore, the deduced values are:
    *   `random_state`: 1
    *   `n_samples`: 150
    *   `n_samples_bootstrap`: 150
