[THOUGHT]
The function `add_event` takes an argument `event` and appends it to the list `self.events`. It does not return anything (implicitly returns `None`).
The output provided is `null`, which is consistent with the return value of `add_event`.
Because the function returns `None` regardless of the input values, and the side effect (updating the list) is not visible in the output, it is impossible to reverse-engineer the exact specific strings (like the specific date or description) used in the original call solely from the output.
Therefore, any syntactically correct input is a valid prediction. We will assume a standard usage scenario where:
1. The `CalendarUtil` instance is new, so `self.events` is an empty list `[]`.
2. The `event` argument is a dictionary containing typical placeholder values for a meeting (e.g., a "Team Meeting" on "2023-01-01").
