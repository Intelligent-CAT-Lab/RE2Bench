The code defines a static method `octal_to_decimal` in the class `NumberConverter` which takes an octal number (as a string) and converts it to a decimal integer using `int(octal_num, 8)`.

To find the input `octal_num`, we need to reverse this operation, which means converting the decimal output `21271` back to its octal representation.

1.  Divide the decimal number by 8 and record the remainder.
    *   $21271 \div 8 = 2658$ with a remainder of $7$.
    *   $2658 \div 8 = 332$ with a remainder of $2$.
    *   $332 \div 8 = 41$ with a remainder of $4$.
    *   $41 \div 8 = 5$ with a remainder of $1$.
    *   $5 \div 8 = 0$ with a remainder of $5$.

2.  Read the remainders from bottom to top (last to first) to get the octal string: `51427`.

3.  Verification: `int("51427", 8)`
    $= 5 \times 8^4 + 1 \times 8^3 + 4 \times 8^2 + 2 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0$
    $= 5 \times 4096 + 1 \times 512 + 4 \times 64 + 2 \times 8 + 7 \times 1$
    $= 20480 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7$
    $= 21271$

The input must be the string `"51427"`.
