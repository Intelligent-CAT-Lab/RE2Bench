The function `right_angle_triangle` checks if three given numbers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, or permutations thereof). The output is `true`, so we need to provide three numbers that form a Pythagorean triple.

A common example of a Pythagorean triple is (3, 4, 5).
Let's verify this input:
- Let `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 5`.
- The first condition checks `a * a == b * b + c * c`: $9 == 16 + 25$ -> $9 == 41$ (False).
- The second condition checks `b * b == a * a + c * c`: $16 == 9 + 25$ -> $16 == 34$ (False).
- The third condition checks `c * c == a * a + b * b`: $25 == 9 + 16$ -> $25 == 25$ (True).
- Since one condition is true, the function returns `True`.

Other possible inputs could include (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), etc. Any valid triple works. I will use 3, 4, 5.
