The method `deposit` updates the account balance by adding the `amount` to the current `self.balance` and returns the new total. To get an output of `300`, the sum of the initial `self.balance` and the `amount` argument must equal 300. Additionally, the code checks that `amount` is non-negative.

We can choose valid values that satisfy the equation: `initial_balance + amount = 300`.
Let's assume the initial balance was `200`.
Then, the deposit amount must be `100`.
Check constraints: `100 >= 0` (valid) and `200 + 100 = 300`.
