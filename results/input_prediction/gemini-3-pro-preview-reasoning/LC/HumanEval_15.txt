The function `string_sequence(n)` generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), converts them to strings, and joins them with spaces.
    
    The code logic is: `return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])`.
    
    The output provided is `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
    
    Breaking down the output string into a list of numbers gives: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
    
    The range used to generate this list is `range(n + 1)`.
    Since `range(start, stop)` generates numbers up to but not including `stop`, `n + 1` must be greater than the last number generated (10) by exactly 1.
    
    The last number in the sequence is `10`.
    Therefore, the generated sequence goes from `0` to `10`.
    This implies `n = 10`.
    
    Checking `range(10 + 1)` -> `range(11)` -> `0, 1, ..., 10`. This matches the output.
