The function `ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2)` calculates the difference between two complex numbers `c1` and `c2`.
The logic is:
1.  Compute the real part difference: `real = c1.real - c2.real`.
2.  Compute the imaginary part difference: `imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag`.
3.  Return a new complex number `complex(real, imaginary)`.

The desired output is `"(2-2j)"`. This corresponds to a complex number with a real part of `2` and an imaginary part of `-2`.
Therefore, we need to find inputs `c1` and `c2` such that:
`c1.real - c2.real = 2`
`c1.imag - c2.imag = -2`

There are infinite pairs of complex numbers that satisfy these equations. I will choose a pair of complex numbers with distinct integer components to serve as a test case.
Let `c2 = 1 + 4j` (real=1, imag=4).
Then `c1` must satisfy:
`c1.real = 2 + c2.real = 2 + 1 = 3`
`c1.imag = -2 + c2.imag = -2 + 4 = 2`
So `c1 = 3 + 2j`.

Verification:
`c1 = 3 + 2j`
`c2 = 1 + 4j`
`subtract(c1, c2)` -> `complex((3-1), (2-4))` -> `complex(2, -2)` -> `(2-2j)`.

Since the output is formatted as a string representation of a complex number, I will provide the inputs in a similar format valid for Python complex literals (strings inside the JSON).
