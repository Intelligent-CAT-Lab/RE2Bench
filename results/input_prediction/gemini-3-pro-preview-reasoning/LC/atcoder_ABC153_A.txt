The code reads two integers $h$ and $a$ from the standard input, interprets them as the height of a monster to attach and the damage of an attack (or similar context usually associated with variable names like these in competitive programming problem statements), calculates the number of attacks needed to defeat the monster using `math.ceil(h / a)`, and prints the result.

Given the output is `6`, we need to find integers $h$ and $a$ such that $\lceil h / a \rceil = 6$.
This mathematical condition implies that $5 < h/a \le 6$.
If we choose $a = 1$, then $5 < h \le 6$, which leads to $h = 6$.
So, one possible input string is `"6 1"`.
Another possibility: if $a = 2$, then $10 < h \le 12$, so $h$ could be $11$ or $12$. Input `"11 2"` would result in $\lceil 5.5 \rceil = 6$.

Let's select $h=6$ and $a=1$.
Input string: `"6 1"`.
Execution trace:
1. `input()` returns `"6 1"`.
2. `.split()` results in `['6', '1']`.
3. `map(int, ...)` converts these to `6` and `1`.
4. `h` becomes `6`, `a` becomes `1`.
5. `h / a` is `6.0`.
6. `math.ceil(6.0)` is `6`.
7. `print(6)` outputs `6`.
