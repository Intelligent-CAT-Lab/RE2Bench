The function `maximum` takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`. It sorts the list in ascending order and returns the last `k` elements (which are the largest `k` elements due to sorting).

1.  **Analyze Output**: The provided output is `[-4, 4]`. This is a list containing two integers.
2.  **Determine `k`**: The output is the result of the slice `arr[-k:]`. Since the output list has a length of 2, `k` must be 2 (assuming the input array had at least 2 elements).
3.  **Determine `arr`**: To produce the output `[-4, 4]`, the input array `arr`, after being sorted, must end with `..., -4, 4`.
    *   This implies that `4` is the largest element and `-4` is the second-largest element (or equal if there were more elements).
    *   The simplest input array that generates this result consists exactly of these elements.
    *   The order in the input array does not matter because the first step in the function is `arr.sort()`.
    *   Let's construct `arr` as `[-4, 4]` (or `[4, -4]`).

**Verification**:
*   Input: `arr = [-4, 4]`, `k = 2`
*   Execution:
    *   `k == 0` is False.
    *   `arr.sort()` modifies `arr` to `[-4, 4]`.
    *   `ans = arr[-2:]` takes the last 2 elements: `[-4, 4]`.
    *   Returns `[-4, 4]`.
*   This matches the output.
