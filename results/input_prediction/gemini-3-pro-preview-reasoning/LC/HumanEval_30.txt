The function `get_positive` iterates through a given list `l` and returns a new list containing only the elements that are strictly greater than 0.
given the output `[4, 5, 6]`, we know that the input list `l` must contain these numbers in that relative order.
Since the function filters out numbers $\le 0$ and keeps numbers $> 0$,, any number in the output must have been present in the input. While the input could also contain non-positive numbers (e.g., `[4, -1, 5, 0, 6]`), information about such numbers is lost in the output. The simplest input that guarantees this output is the list itself.
Therefore, `l` can be `[4, 5, 6]`.
