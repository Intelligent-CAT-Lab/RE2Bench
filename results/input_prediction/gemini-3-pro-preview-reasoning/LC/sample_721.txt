The function `f` sorts the input list `nums` in place inside a loop and returns it. Even though the sorting operation is performed multiple times (specifically `len(nums) - 2` times), the final state of the list is simply the elements of the input list sorted in ascending order. Therefore, to produce the output `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`, the input `nums` must act as a list containing these exact integers. Any permutation of these numbers would yield the same output. We can simply use the output list as the input.

[THOUGHT]
The function `f(nums)` performs the following steps:
1. Calculates `count = len(nums)`.
2. Loops with index `num` from 2 to `count`.
3. Inside the loop, it calls `nums.sort()`, which sorts the list in-place in ascending order.
4. Returns the list `nums`.

The operation `nums.sort()` makes the list sorted. Repeatedly sorting a sorted list generally leaves it unchanged. Thus, the function returns the sorted version of the input list.
The given output is `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
This implies that the input `nums` contained these elements. Since the sort order is ascending, the input could have been any permutation of `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`. The simplest valid input assumption is the list itself (or an unsorted version). I will provide the list containing these elements.
