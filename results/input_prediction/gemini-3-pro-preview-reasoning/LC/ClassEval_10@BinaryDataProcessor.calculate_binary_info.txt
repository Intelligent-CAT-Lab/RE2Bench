[THOUGHT]
The method `calculate_binary_info` returns a dictionary containing the length of the binary string and the percentage of zeroes and ones.
Based on the provided output:
1.  `Bit length` is 40. This implies `len(self.binary_string) == 40`.
2.  `Zeroes` percentage is 0.475. The count of '0's is $40 \times 0.475 = 19$.
3.  `Ones` percentage is 0.525. The count of '1's is $40 \times 0.525 = 21$.
4.  Verification: $19 + 21 = 40$. Matches the bit length.

Although the `__init__` method refers to a `clean_non_binary_chars` method which is not shown, we need to provide the value of the `self.binary_string` attribute that would result in these statistics. The specific order of characters does not matter for the counts. A valid string must simply contain 19 '0's and 21 '1's.

Constructing the string:
19 zeroes: `0000000000000000000`
21 ones: `111111111111111111111`
Combined: `0000000000000000000111111111111111111111`
