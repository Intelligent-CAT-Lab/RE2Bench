The code snippet takes a single character input, converts it to its integer representation using `ord()`, increments that value by 1, and then converts it back to a character using `chr()`.

1. **Analyze the output**: The output is given as `"b"`.
2. **Reverse the operation**:
   - The final printed character is `'b'`.
   - The operation performed was `chr(ord(input) + 1)`.
   - So, `ord(input) + 1 = ord('b')`.
   - The ASCII value of `'b'` is 98.
   - Therefore, `ord(input) + 1 = 98`, which means `ord(input) = 97`.
   - The character with ASCII value 97 is `'a'`.

So, the input must have been `'a'`.
