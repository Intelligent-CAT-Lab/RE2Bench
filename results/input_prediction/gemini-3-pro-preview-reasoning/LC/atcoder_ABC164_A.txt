The code reads two integers $S$ and $W$ from the input. It checks if $S \le W$. If this condition is true, it prints 'unsafe'. Since the expected output is "unsafe", we need to provide two integers where the first is less than or equal to the second. Choosing $S=10$ and $W=20$ yields $10 \le 20$, which is True.
