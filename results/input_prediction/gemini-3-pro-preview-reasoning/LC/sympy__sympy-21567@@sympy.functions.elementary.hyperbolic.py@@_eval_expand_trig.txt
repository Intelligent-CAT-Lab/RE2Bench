[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Class and Method**: The function `_eval_expand_trig` belongs to the class `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction`. This class inherits from `HyperbolicFunction` (and typically `Function`). In SymPy, hyperbolic functions (like `sinh`, `cosh`) and their reciprocals (like `sech`, `csch`) are unary functions, meaning they take exactly one argument.

2.  **Analyze the Output**: The provided output is `{"nargs": {"_args_set": "{'1'}"}}`. This JSON represents the attributes of the object returned by the function. The `nargs` attribute refers to the number of arguments the function accepts. The value `"{'1'}"` for `_args_set` indicates that the returned object defines its valid argument count as a set containing the single value 1 (representing unary arity).

3.  **Determine the Input `self`**: The input structure asks for the attributes of `self` (the instance on which the method is called). Since `self` is an instance of `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction`, and all such functions are unary (arity 1), `self` must also have an `nargs` attribute reflecting this.

4.  **Match Input to Output**: Given that both the input object (a reciprocal hyperbolic function) and the result (likely a transformed expression preserving the functional nature or arity context) are unary, the `nargs` property for `self` should be identical to the one seen in the output. The string representation provided in the output is `"{'1'}"`.

5.  **Fill Placeholders**: The placeholder `XXX` for `_args_set` in the input structure should be filled with `"{'1'}"`. The `args` and `kwargs` keys in the structure are empty and require no filling.

6.  **Conclusion**: The input `self` has `nargs` with `_args_set` equal to `"{'1'}"`.
