The goal is to determine the input parameters for the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class that result in the output `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`.

1.  **Analyze the `select` method**:
    ```python
    def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):
        if fields is None:
            fields = '*'
        else:
            fields = ', '.join(fields)
        sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'
        if condition is not None:
            sql += f' WHERE {condition}'
        return sql + ';'
    ```

2.  **Deconstruct the Output String**:
    Target output: `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`

    *   **Part 1: `SELECT *`**: The code sets `fields = '*'` if the input `fields` argument is `None`. Since the provided structure shows `args: {}` and `kwargs` only containing `condition`, `fields` is taking its default value of `None`.
    *   **Part 2: `FROM table1`**: The code performs string interpolation with `{self.table_name}` after `FROM`. Just looking at the output, the value after `FROM` is `table1`. Therefore, `self.table_name` must be `"table1"`.
    *   **Part 3: `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20`**: The code appends ` WHERE {condition}` if `condition` is provided. The text following `WHERE` (and before the final semicolon) is `age BETWEEN 10 AND 20`. Therefore, the `condition` argument must be `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
    *   **Part 4: `;`**: The code appends `;` at the return statement, which matches the end of the output string.

3.  **Map to Input Structure**:
    *   `self.table_name`: `"table1"`
    *   `kwargs` -> `condition`: `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`
