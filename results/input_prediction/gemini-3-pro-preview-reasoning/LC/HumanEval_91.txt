The function `is_bored` splits the input string `S` into a list of sentences using the regular expression `[.?!]\s*`, which interprets periods, question marks, and exclamation marks as sentence delimiters. It then iterates through the resulting sentences and counts how many valid sentences start with "I " (the letter I followed by a space).

To get an output of `0`, we need to provide a string `S` such that none of the split sentences start with "I ".

Let's trace with a candidate input `S = "Hello world"`:
1.  `sentences = re.split('[.?!]\\s*', "Hello world")` results in `['Hello world']` because there are no matching delimiters.
2.  The generator expression iterates:
    -   For `sentence = 'Hello world'`: `sentence[0:2]` is `"He"`. `"He" == "I "` is `False` (0).
3.  `sum(...)` sums these values, resulting in `0`.

This matches the target output.
