[THOUGHT]
The function `interval_contains(interval, val)` checks if a value `val` lies within the closed range defined by `interval` (interpreted as `[min(a,b), max(a,b)]`).
1. The function unpacks `interval` into `a` and `b`.
2. It ensures `a` is the lower bound and `b` is the upper bound by swapping them if `a > b`.
3. It returns the boolean result of `a <= val <= b`.
4. The target output is `np.True_` (which represents `True`).
5. Therefore, we need to provide an `interval` pair and a `val` such that `val` is inclusively between the two numbers in `interval`.
6. Arbitrarily choosing simple integers: let `interval` be `[1, 3]` and `val` be `2`.
   - `a` becomes 1, `b` becomes 3.
   - `1 > 3` is False.
   - `1 <= 2 <= 3` is True.
   - This satisfies the condition.
