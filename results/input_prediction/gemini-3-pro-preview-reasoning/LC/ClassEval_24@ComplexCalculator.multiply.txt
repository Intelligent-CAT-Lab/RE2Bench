The user wants to find the inputs `c1` and `c2` for the `ComplexCalculator.multiply` method that result in the output `(-5+10j)`.

1.  **Analyze the Code**: The `multiply` method takes two arguments `c1` and `c2` and calculates their product using the standard formula for complex multiplication:
    `real = c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag`
    `imaginary = c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real`
    It returns a `complex` object.

2.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `(-5+10j)`. This is the string representation of the complex number $-5 + 10i$. We need to find `c1` and `c2` such that `c1 * c2 = -5 + 10j`.

3.  **Determine Factors**:
    Calculations with complex integers (Gaussian integers) often depend on the norm (magnitude squared).
    The norm of the target is $|-5 + 10j|^2 = (-5)^2 + 10^2 = 25 + 100 = 125$.
    We need integer norms that multiply to 125. A nice factorization is $5 \times 25$.
    *   Norm 5 can be formed by $1^2 + 2^2$. Complex numbers like $1+2j, 1-2j, 2+1j$, etc.
    *   Norm 25 can be formed by $3^2 + 4^2$. Complex numbers like $3+4j, 3-4j, 4+3j$, or just $5$ ($5^2+0^2$).

4.  **Test Candidates**:
    Let's try $c1 = 1 + 2j$ (Norm 5).
    We solve for $c2$: $c2 = \frac{-5+10j}{1+2j}$.
    Multiply numerator and denominator by conjugate $(1-2j)$:
    Numerator: $(-5+10j)(1-2j) = -5 + 10j + 10j - 20j^2 = -5 + 20j + 20 = 15 + 20j$.
    Denominator: $1^2 + 2^2 = 5$.
    Result: $\frac{15+20j}{5} = 3 + 4j$.
    So, $c1 = 1 + 2j$ and $c2 = 3 + 4j$ is a valid pair.

5.  **Verify**:
    `multiply(1+2j, 3+4j)`
    `real = 1*3 - 2*4 = 3 - 8 = -5`
    `imaginary = 1*4 + 2*3 = 4 + 6 = 10`
    Result: `complex(-5, 10)` which corresponds to `(-5+10j)`.

6.  **Format Input**: Since `c1` and `c2` are complex objects, and JSON cannot represent them natively, they are typically represented by their Python string representation or as strings that can be parsed. Given the output format `(-5+10j)`, the corresponding string representations for inputs are `(1+2j)` and `(3+4j)`.
