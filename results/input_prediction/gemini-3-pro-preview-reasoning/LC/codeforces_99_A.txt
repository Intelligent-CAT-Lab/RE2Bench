[THOUGHT]
The code takes user input, splits it by `.`, and performs checks to decide what to print.
The output provided is `2`.

Analysis of the code paths:
1. `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`:
   Checks if the last digit of the integer part is 9. If so, it prints a specific string `'GOTO ▁ Vasilisa .'`.
   Since the output is `2`, this condition must be false. Thus, the integer part of the input number does not end in 9.

2. `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`:
   Checks if the first digit of the fractional part is 5 or greater. If so, it prints `int(num[0]) + 1`.
   This is effectively rounding up.
   If this path was taken, `int(num[0]) + 1 == 2`.
   Therefore, `int(num[0])` must be `1`.
   For this to be valid, `num[0]` must be "1" (which does not end in 9, satisfying condition 1).
   And `num[1][0]` must be >= 5.
   Possible inputs: "1.5", "1.6", "1.7", "1.8", "1.9".

3. `else:`:
   It prints `num[0]` directly.
   This is effectively rounding down (truncation) for fractional parts < 5.
   If this path was taken, `num[0]` (as a string) must be "2".
   For this to be valid, `num[0]` must be "2" (which does not end in 9, satisfying condition 1).
   And `num[1][0]` must be < 5.
   Possible inputs: "2.0", "2.1", "2.2", "2.3", "2.4".

Selection:
I can choose any valid input that produces the output `2`.
Let's choose the input "1.6".
- `input().split('.')` -> `['1', '6']`.
- `int('1')` is 1, last digit is 1 != 9. (Condition 1 False).
- `num[1][0]` is '6'. `int('6')` is 6, which is >= 5. (Condition 2 True).
- Prints `int('1') + 1` -> `2`.
This matches the output.
