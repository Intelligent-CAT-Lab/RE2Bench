[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums`. It iterates `range(len(nums) - 1)` times, and in each iteration, it reverses the list `nums` in place.
Let $N$ be the length of `nums`. The list is reversed $N-1$ times.
If $N-1$ is even, the list undergoes an even number of reversals, resulting in the original list.
If $N-1$ is odd, the list undergoes an odd number of reversals, resulting in the reversed list.

Looking at the output: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
Length $N$ = 7.
The number of iterations is $N - 1 = 6$.
6 is an even number.
Reversing a list 6 times returns the list to its original state.
Therefore, the input `nums` must be identical to the output.

Verification:
Input: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
Length: 7.
Loop runs 6 times.
1. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
2. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
3. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
4. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
5. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
6. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
Final result matches output.
