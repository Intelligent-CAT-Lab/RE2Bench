The function `_cmp_name` compares two types `x` and `y` to determine their sort order. The output `1` indicates that `x` compares greater than `y` (`x > y`).

**Analysis of the code:**
1.  The function retrieves the names `n1` and `n2` of the types `x` and `y`.
2.  It checks if `y` is a subclass of `Basic`. If not, it returns `-1`. To get `1`, `y` must be a subclass of `Basic`.
3.  It looks up the indices of `n1` and `n2` in a global list `ordering_of_classes`.
4.  If both are found, it compares indices.
5.  If one is found and the other is not (UNKNOWN), the UNKNOWN one is treated as having a higher index (larger).
6.  If neither is found, it compares names lexicographically.
7.  The return value is `(x > y) - (x < y)`. For `1`, we need `x > y`.

**Inferring inputs from context:**
*   The "Functions called during execution" include `_preorder_traversal` which iterates over `Basic` objects, and `numbered_symbols` which creates instances of the `Symbol` class (default for `cls` argument).
*   It is highly probable that `x` and `y` are standard SymPy classes like `Basic` and `Symbol`.
*   Typically, `Basic` is the base class for all SymPy objects and appears first (index 0) in `ordering_of_classes`.
*   `Symbol` is a subclass of `Basic`, appearing later in the list.
*   Therefore, `Index(Symbol) > Index(Basic)`.

**Simulating with candidates `x=Symbol`, `y=Basic`:**
1.  `x.__name__` is "Symbol", `y.__name__` is "Basic".
2.  `issubclass(Basic, Basic)` is True.
3.  Assuming standard `ordering_of_classes` starts with `['Basic', ..., 'Symbol', ...]`:
    *   `i1` (Symbol index) > `i2` (Basic index).
    *   Result: `1`.
4.  Even if both are unknown (not in list), lexicographically `"Symbol"` > `"Basic"`, so `(True) - (False) = 1`.

Thus, inputs `x="Symbol"` and `y="Basic"` are the most consistent prediction. The inputs in the structure are represented as strings corresponding to the class names.
