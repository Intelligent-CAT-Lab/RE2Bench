[THOUGHT]
The function `waist2rayleigh` computes the value according to the formula: `result = w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen`.
The expected output is the string `"pi*w_0**2/l"`.

We need to align the variables in the formula with the variables in the output string:
1.  The formula has `pi` in the numerator. The output has `pi` in the numerator.
2.  The formula has `w ** 2` in the numerator. The output has `w_0**2` in the numerator. This suggests the input argument `w` should be the symbol (represented as a string) `"w_0"`.
3.  The formula has `wavelen` in the denominator. The output has `l` in the denominator. This suggests the input argument `wavelen` should be the symbol `"l"`.
4.  The formula has `n` in the numerator. The output does not show `n`, implying `n` is the multiplicative identity, which is `1`.

The function definition `def waist2rayleigh(w, wavelen, n=1):` shows that `w` and `wavelen` are passed through `sympify`. Thus passing strings "w_0" and "l" is valid. `n` is not sympified explicitly, but multiplication works with standard numbers.

Therefore:
`w` = "w_0"
`wavelen` = "l"
`n` = 1
