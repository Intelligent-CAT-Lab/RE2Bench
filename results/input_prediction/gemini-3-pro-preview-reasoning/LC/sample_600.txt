[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes an `array` (list) as input.
It creates `just_ns` by mapping a lambda function over the input `array`. The lambda multiplies the string 'n' by the number found in the array.
Then it iterates over `just_ns` and copies elements into `final_output`.
Finally, it returns `final_output`.

The desired output is `[]`.
For `final_output` to be `[]`, the loop `for wipe in just_ns` must not have appended anything, or `just_ns` was empty.
Since `final_output` is essentially a copy of `just_ns`, `just_ns` must be `[]`.
`just_ns` is the result of `list(map(..., array))`.
For the resulting list of a map operation to be empty, the input iterable (`array`) must be empty.
Therefore, `array` must be `[]`.
