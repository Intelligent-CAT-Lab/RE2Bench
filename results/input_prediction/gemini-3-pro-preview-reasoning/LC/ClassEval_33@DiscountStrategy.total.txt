[THOUGHT]
The function `DiscountStrategy.total` calculates the total price of items in `self.cart`.
The logic is: `sum((item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.cart))`.
The target output is `250.0`.
To achieve this, the contents of `self.cart` must satisfy the equation $\sum (quantity \times price) = 250.0$.
The `customer` and `promotion` attributes are part of the class but are not used within the `total` method, so their values can be arbitrary.
I will construct a `cart` containing a single item with a quantity of 2 and a price of 125.0 (since $2 \times 125.0 = 250.0$).
For the customer, I will provide a sample name "John Doe" and fidelity score of 10.
For promotion, I will set it to `null` (None).
