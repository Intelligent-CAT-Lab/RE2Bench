Based on the provided code and output, here is the reasoning to determine the input:

[THOUGHT]
The function `parse_music` takes a string argument `music_string`.
It defines a dictionary `note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}`.
It processes the input string by splitting it on spaces (`split(' ')`) and iterating over the resulting parts. Empty parts are ignored.
For each valid part `x`, it looks up `note_map[x]` and appends it to the result list.

The given output is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
To get a value of `1` in the output list, the corresponding string part `x` must be `'.|'` (since `note_map['.|'] == 1`).
Since the output list has four `1`s, the input string must have yielded the token `'.|'` four times when split by spaces.
Therefore, a valid input string is four `'.|'` substrings separated by spaces.
Input construction: `".| .| .| .|"`
