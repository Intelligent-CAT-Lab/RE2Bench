The function `add` takes two arguments `x` and `y`, hinted as integers, and returns their sum.
The output is given as `1223`.
Therefore, we need to find two integers `x` and `y` such that `x + y = 1223`.
There are infinitely many solutions to this equation (e.g., 0 + 1223, 1 + 1222, etc.).
I will select the values `x = 1000` and `y = 223` as a distinct pair that satisfies the condition `1000 + 223 = 1223`.
