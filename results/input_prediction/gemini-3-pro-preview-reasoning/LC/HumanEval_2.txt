The function `truncate_number(number: float) -> float` returns the result of `number % 1.0`. This operation returns the fractional part of the number.
The output provided is `0.33000000000000007`. This indicates a floating-point precision artifact.
We need to find a number `x` such that `x % 1.0` results in exactly `0.33000000000000007`.

Let's test common values:
1.  Try `x = 0.33`. In standard IEEE 754 double precision, `0.33` is approximately `0.32999999999999996`. Since `0.33 < 1.0`, `0.33 % 1.0` returns `0.33`. This does not match `0.33000000000000007`.
2.  Try `x = 1.33`.
    *   `1.33` represented as a float is approximately `1.33000000000000007105...`.
    *   Calculating `1.33 % 1.0` is effectively `1.33 - 1.0`.
    *   `1.33000000000000007... - 1.0` results in `0.33000000000000007...`.
    *   This matches the output exactly.
    
Therefore, the input `number` must have been `1.33`. Other candidates like `13.33` or `2.33` might also produce this, but `1.33` is the most straightforward and standard test case value for such problems.
