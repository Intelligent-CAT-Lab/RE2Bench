In order to determine the input for the function `car_race_collision`, we need to analyze the logic provided in the code.

The function is defined as follows:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n ** 2
```
It takes an integer `n` and returns the square of that integer (`n` to the power of 2).

Given the output:
```
9
```

We need to reverse the operation `n ** 2 = 9`. 
To find `n`, we calculate the square root of 9, which is 3 (since $3 \times 3 = 9$). Note that -3 is also a mathematical solution, but usually, variables like `n` in such contexts represent counts or indices, implying a positive integer.

Therefore, `n` is `3`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `car_race_collision` takes a single argument `n` and returns `n` squared ($n^2$).
The provided output is 9.
To find the input, I need to solve the equation $n^2 = 9$.
Taking the square root of 9 gives $\pm3$.
In programming contexts involving counts (implied by "n", often used for number of items), the positive integer is the standard expected input.
So, $n = 3$.
Verification: $3^2 = 9$. The output matches.
