The function `clean_non_binary_chars` acts on the instance attribute `self.binary_string`. It filters the string to keep only characters '0' and '1', updates `self.binary_string` with the result, and implicitly returns `None` (which appears as `null` in the output).

Because the function's return value is always `None` regardless of the input string, the output provided (`null`) does not uniquely constrain the input `binary_string`. Any string value for `binary_string` would produce this output.

However, based on the variable name `binary_string` and the class context, a plausible input is a string consisting of binary digits. I will use `"101010"` as a representative valid input state for the object's attribute.

[THOUGHT]
The method `clean_non_binary_chars` filters `self.binary_string` and modifies it in-place. It does not return the string; it returns `None`.
The provided output is `null`.
Since the return is constant (`None`) for any input string, we cannot mathematically deduce the specific original string from the output.
However, we need to populate the input structure with a valid state for `self.binary_string`.
A typical value for `binary_string` would be a sequence of '0's and '1's.
I will assume a standard binary string like `"101010"` to populate the input field.
