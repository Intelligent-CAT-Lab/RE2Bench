The function `remove_vowels(text)` iterates through the input string and constructs a new string containing only characters that are not vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

The provided output is `"bcdf\nghjklm"`.
Observing the characters in the output:
1.  `bcdf`: This corresponds to the consonants at the beginning of the alphabet: b, c, d, (e is skipped), f. 'a' is likely the starting vowel skipped.
2.  `\n`: A newline character is preserved.
3.  `ghjklm`: This sequence corresponds to the alphabet following f: g, h, (i is skipped), j, k, l, m.

The visible characters follow a strict alphabetical order: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m.
The gaps in this sequence strictly correspond to vowels:
-   'a' (before b)
-   'e' (between d and f)
-   'i' (between h and j)

Since the output preserves the order of non-vowel characters, and the output follows the alphabet, it is highly probable that the input was the continuous alphabet sequence from 'a' to 'm', containing the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i' at their respective positions.
The newline character `\n` sits between 'f' and 'g'.

Reconstructing the input:
-   Start with 'a' (filtered out)
-   'b', 'c', 'd' (kept)
-   'e' (filtered out)
-   'f' (kept)
-   '\n' (kept)
-   'g', 'h' (kept)
-   'i' (filtered out)
-   'j', 'k', 'l', 'm' (kept)

Combined input string: `"abcdef\nghijklm"`.
