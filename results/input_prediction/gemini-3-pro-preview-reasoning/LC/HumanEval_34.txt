The function `unique` takes a list `l`, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, converts it back to a list, and then sorts it.
To produce the output `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, the input list `l` must contain at least one instance of each of the numbers 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 123, and no other numbers.
Because the function sorts the result and removes duplicates, the input `l` could be sorted or unsorted, and could contain duplicates.
Without additional information to restore the original order or frequency of elements, the output list itself is a valid input that produces this output.
Therefore, we can predict the input `l` to be `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
