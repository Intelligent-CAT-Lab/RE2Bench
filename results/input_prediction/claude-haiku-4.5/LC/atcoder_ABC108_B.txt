[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The output is: "101 99 101 100"

This means:
- x2 - b = 101
- y2 + a = 99
- x1 - b = 101
- y1 + a = 100

Where:
- a = x2 - x1
- b = y2 - y1

From the equations:
1. x2 - b = 101  →  x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101
2. y2 + a = 99   →  y2 + (x2 - x1) = 99
3. x1 - b = 101  →  x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101
4. y1 + a = 100  →  y1 + (x2 - x1) = 100

From equations 1 and 3:
- x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101
- x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101
This means: x2 = x1, so a = x2 - x1 = 0

From equation 4 with a = 0:
- y1 + 0 = 100
- y1 = 100

From equation 2 with a = 0:
- y2 + 0 = 99
- y2 = 99

So b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1

From equation 1:
- x2 - (-1) = 101
- x2 + 1 = 101
- x2 = 100

Since a = 0 and x2 = x1:
- x1 = 100

Let me verify:
- x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 100, y2 = 99
- a = 100 - 100 = 0
- b = 99 - 100 = -1
- x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99 ✓
- x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100 ✓

The input should be: "100 100 100 99"
