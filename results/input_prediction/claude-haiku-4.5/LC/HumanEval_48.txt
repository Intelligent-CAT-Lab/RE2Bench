[THOUGHT]
The function `is_palindrome` checks if a string reads the same forwards and backwards by comparing characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the middle.

The function returns `False` when it finds a mismatch between `text[i]` and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` for some index `i`.

Since the output is `false`, this means the function returned `False`, which means at some point during the loop, a character at position `i` did not match the character at position `len(text) - 1 - i`.

The simplest example would be a string that is not a palindrome. For instance:
- "ab" would have: text[0]='a' vs text[1]='b', which are different, so it returns False
- "abc" would have: text[0]='a' vs text[2]='c', which are different, so it returns False
- "hello" would have: text[0]='h' vs text[4]='o', which are different, so it returns False

Any non-palindromic string would work. I'll use a simple example like "ab" or "hello".
