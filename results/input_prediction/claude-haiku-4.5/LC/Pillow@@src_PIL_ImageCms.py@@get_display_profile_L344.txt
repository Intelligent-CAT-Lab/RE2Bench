[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `get_display_profile` to determine what input would produce `None` as output.

The function returns `None` in two cases:
1. If `sys.platform != 'win32'` (line 9-10), it returns None immediately
2. If `profile is None` after calling `core.get_display_profile_win32(...)` (line 16-17), it returns None

Since the output is `None`, either:
- The platform is not Windows, OR
- The core function returned None

The most straightforward way to get `None` output is if `sys.platform != 'win32'`. In that case, the function returns `None` immediately without even using the `handle` parameter.

So the input could be any value for `handle`. Since the structure shows `handle: XXX`, I can use any value. The simplest would be `None` or `0` or any other value - it doesn't matter since the function will return `None` before using it on non-Windows platforms.

However, let me also consider: if we're on Windows and want `None` output, then `core.get_display_profile_win32()` must return `None`. This is possible, but we don't know the platform the function is being executed on.

The most likely scenario for getting `None` output is that `sys.platform != 'win32'`, making the `handle` value irrelevant. I'll use `None` as a reasonable default.
