[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The function `sum_squares` does the following:
1. Initializes `squared = 0`
2. For each element `i` in `lst`, it adds `math.ceil(i) ** 2` to `squared`
3. Returns `squared`

So we need: sum of `math.ceil(i) ** 2` for all elements = 1086

Let me think about what values could sum to 1086.

Some perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1024, 1089...

1089 is too large (33²), so we need squares that sum to 1086.

Let me try: 32² = 1024, leaving 62 remaining
31² = 961, leaving 125 remaining
30² = 900, leaving 186 remaining

Let me try a combination:
- 32² = 1024, remainder = 62
- Could be 7² + 3² + 2² + 1² = 49 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 63 (too much by 1)
- Could be 7² + 2² + 1² = 49 + 4 + 1 = 54 (need 62)
- Could be 7² + 3² + 1² = 49 + 9 + 1 = 59 (need 62)
- Could be 7² + 3² + 2² = 49 + 9 + 4 = 62 ✓

So: 32² + 7² + 3² + 2² = 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4 = 1086 ✓

This means we need `math.ceil(i)` to give us 32, 7, 3, and 2.
- For ceil(i) = 32: i could be any value in (31, 32]
- For ceil(i) = 7: i could be any value in (6, 7]
- For ceil(i) = 3: i could be any value in (2, 3]
- For ceil(i) = 2: i could be any value in (1, 2]

The simplest would be to use exact integers: [32, 7, 3, 2]
Or we could use: [31.5, 6.5, 2.5, 1.5] etc.

Let me verify with [32, 7, 3, 2]:
- ceil(32) = 32, 32² = 1024
- ceil(7) = 7, 7² = 49
- ceil(3) = 3, 3² = 9
- ceil(2) = 2, 2² = 4
- Total: 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4 = 1086 ✓
