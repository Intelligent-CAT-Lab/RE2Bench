[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `morsel_to_cookie` to understand what input would produce a `null` output.

The function:
1. Initializes `expires = None`
2. Checks if `morsel['max-age']` exists - if it does, tries to convert it to an integer and calculate expiry time
3. Else checks if `morsel['expires']` exists - if it does, parses it using the time template
4. Calls `create_cookie(...)` with various parameters extracted from the morsel
5. Returns the result from `create_cookie()`

The output is `null`, which means the function either:
- Returned `None` explicitly
- Raised an exception that was caught somewhere
- The `create_cookie()` call failed

Looking at `create_cookie()`, it returns `cookielib.Cookie(**result)`. This would likely return a Cookie object, not `None`.

However, the output shows `"output": null`, which suggests an exception occurred or something went wrong. Given the structure of the code, if both `morsel['max-age']` and `morsel['expires']` are falsy (None, empty string, 0, False, etc.), then `expires` remains `None` and the code proceeds to `create_cookie()`.

The most likely scenario for a `null` output is that an exception was raised. Looking at the code:
- If `morsel['max-age']` is set but not a valid integer, it raises `TypeError`
- The `create_cookie()` call could fail if parameters are invalid

For a `null` output to be returned (rather than an exception), the function likely completed but returned `None` somehow. However, looking at the code, there's no explicit `return None`.

Actually, re-reading the output format, `"output": null` likely means the function raised an exception or failed. Let me construct a morsel that would cause an error:

If `morsel['max-age']` is a non-integer string, it will raise a `TypeError`. This would be caught somewhere and result in `null`.

Let me create a morsel that triggers the `ValueError` path in the max-age handling:
- `max-age`: some non-integer value like "invalid"
- `expires`: None or empty (so it doesn't use the expires path)

This would raise `TypeError('max-age: invalid must be integer')` which would propagate.

Alternatively, for a cleaner `null` output, I'll provide a morsel with:
- `max-age`: None or empty
- `expires`: None or empty
- Other fields: reasonable defaults

Let me use safe defaults:
```
{
    "expires": null,
    "path": "/",
    "comment": null,
    "domain": "",
    "max-age": null,
    "secure": false,
    "httponly": false,
    "version": null,
    "samesite": null
}
```

But I need to add the `key` and `value` properties since the code accesses `morsel.key` and `morsel.value`.

Actually, looking more carefully, a morsel object would have a `.key` attribute (the cookie name) and `.value` attribute. These aren't in the structure provided, so I'll assume the morsel dict-like object supports both dictionary access and attribute access.

For `null` output, the most straightforward input would be one that doesn't cause an exception. Let me provide a basic morsel:
