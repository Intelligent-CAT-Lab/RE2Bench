[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `vector_part` method execution:

1. The `vector_part` method is called on `self` (a Quaternion instance).
2. It returns `Quaternion(0, self.b, self.c, self.d)`.
3. The output is "0 + x*i + y*j + z*k", which represents a quaternion with:
   - a (real part) = 0
   - b (i component) = x
   - c (j component) = y
   - d (k component) = z

4. So the input quaternion (self) must have:
   - self.b = x
   - self.c = y
   - self.d = z
   - self.a = can be anything (since vector_part sets it to 0)

5. To construct this input quaternion, we need to determine what properties it should have. Looking at the `__new__` method signature, a Quaternion has:
   - a, b, c, d (the four components)
   - real_field (boolean, default True)
   - norm (optional norm value)

6. The output "0 + x*i + y*j + z*k" is created by `Quaternion(0, x, y, z)`. This means the input quaternion that called `vector_part()` must have had:
   - b = x
   - c = y
   - d = z

7. For the `self` object that `vector_part()` is called on, we need to specify the internal state. According to the structure, we need `_real_field` and `_norm`.

8. Since the output doesn't suggest any special norm or real_field setting, I'll use the defaults:
   - _real_field: True (default value)
   - _norm: None (default value)

The question is asking for the input to `vector_part`, which means we need the state of `self` when `vector_part()` is called. The input quaternion would have had some values for a, b, c, d. Since we don't know the exact input quaternion but can infer from the output that it needs b=x, c=y, d=z, I should represent the self object appropriately.

Actually, looking more carefully at the structure provided - it only asks for `_real_field` and `_norm`, not the args. This suggests the structure is asking only for these two instance variables. The args would be determined by the Quaternion's args property.

Since we're looking at what `self` needs to be for `vector_part()` to return "0 + x*i + y*j + z*k", and we don't have explicit information about what the original a value was, the most reasonable assumption is that `self` was a quaternion with all components set. The `_real_field` and `_norm` would be their default values unless specified otherwise.
