[THOUGHT]
The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` and returns `n ** 2` (n squared).

Given the output is `9`, I need to find what value of `n` when squared equals 9.

If `n ** 2 = 9`, then `n = 3` or `n = -3`.

Since the function signature specifies `n: int` without any additional constraints, and the most common/natural case would be the positive value, `n = 3` is the most likely input.

Let me verify: `3 ** 2 = 9` ✓

This matches the expected output.
