Let me analyze the function `_approx_fprime` and work backwards from the output to determine the inputs.

The function computes a numerical gradient:
1. It evaluates `f0 = f(*(xk,) + args)` 
2. It creates `grad = np.zeros((f0.shape[0], f0.shape[1], len(xk)), float)`
3. For each dimension k in xk, it computes the finite difference: `(f(xk + d) - f0) / d[k]`

From the output:
- The output is a 3D array with shape that appears to be (5, 5, 1)
- Looking at the structure: `[[[0.], [0.606...], ...], [[0.606...], [0.], ...], ...]`
- This is 5 rows, each with 5 columns, and each element is wrapped in a list (suggesting depth of 1)
- So the shape is (5, 5, 1)

This means:
- `f0.shape = (5, 5)` - so f returns a 5x5 matrix
- `len(xk) = 1` - so xk has only 1 element
- The gradient array has shape (5, 5, 1)

The output shows what appears to be a kernel matrix (symmetric with zeros on diagonal, positive values elsewhere). This matches a pairwise kernel computation with gamma parameter.

Since `len(xk) = 1`, xk should be a 1-element array. Given the context is computing gradients w.r.t. gamma (in log space based on `np.exp(gamma)`), xk would be something like `[0.]` (the log of the gamma parameter).

The epsilon parameter is used for finite differences. A typical value is around 1e-5 or 1e-8.

The `args` parameter (additional arguments to f) would be empty tuple `()` in this case since the helper function `f` only takes gamma as parameter.

The function `f` is the kernel computation helper that takes gamma as input.

Given:
- Output shape (5, 5, 1)
- The gradient values appear to be showing differences in kernel values
- xk must be length 1
- A reasonable initial value for log-gamma would be 0.0 (corresponding to gamma=1.0)
- epsilon should be a small positive value, typically 1e-5

Let me verify: if xk has 1 element, f0 has shape (5,5), then grad has shape (5, 5, 1), which matches the output.
