The function calculates skewness of data. Let me analyze when the output would be 0.

Looking at the skewness formula:
```
skewness = sum(((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data)) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation != 0 else 0
```

The skewness will be 0 in two cases:
1. When `std_deviation == 0` (all values are identical)
2. When `sum(((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data)) == 0` (the cubic deviations sum to zero)

Case 1 is simpler: if all values are the same, std_deviation = 0, and the function returns 0 directly.

For example, if `data = [5, 5, 5]`:
- mean = 15/3 = 5
- variance = (0 + 0 + 0)/3 = 0
- std_deviation = 0
- Returns 0 (because std_deviation == 0)

Also, data = [1, 1, 1] or any constant list would work.

Case 2: If the data is symmetric around the mean, the sum of cubic deviations would be 0.
For example, [1, 2, 3]:
- mean = 2
- Cubic deviations: (1-2)³ = -1, (2-2)³ = 0, (3-2)³ = 1
- Sum = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
- This would also give skewness = 0

The simplest case is when all values are identical. Let me verify with [1, 1, 1]:
- n = 3
- mean = 1
- variance = 0
- std_deviation = 0
- Returns 0

Or a symmetric case like [1, 2, 3]:
- n = 3
- mean = 2
- variance = ((1-2)² + (2-2)² + (3-2)²)/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3
- std_deviation = sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.8165
- Sum of cubes: (1-2)³ + (2-2)³ + (3-2)³ = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
- skewness = 0 * 3 / (2 * 1 * std_deviation³) = 0

Both work. I'll go with the symmetric case [1, 2, 3] as it's more interesting, though [1, 1, 1] also works.
