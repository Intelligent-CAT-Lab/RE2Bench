[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what it does:

```python
def f(nums):
    for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
        nums.reverse()
    return nums
```

The function reverses the list `len(nums) - 1` times.

Given output: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

The list has 7 elements, so `len(nums) = 7`, which means the loop runs `7 - 1 = 6` times.

Let me work backwards. If we reverse the list 6 times:
- After 1 reverse: list becomes reversed
- After 2 reverses: list becomes original (back to start)
- After 3 reverses: list becomes reversed
- After 4 reverses: list becomes original
- After 5 reverses: list becomes reversed
- After 6 reverses: list becomes original

So after an even number of reverses, the list returns to its original state. Since we do 6 reverses (even number), the final output should equal the original input.

Therefore, the input must be: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

Let me verify:
- Start: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
- After reverse 1: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After reverse 2: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- After reverse 3: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After reverse 4: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- After reverse 5: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After reverse 6: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Yes, this confirms that the input is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
