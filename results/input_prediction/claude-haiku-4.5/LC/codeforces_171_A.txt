Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The output is: 1165701527

The code does:
1. `a, b = input().split()` - splits input into two parts
2. `b = int(b[::-1])` - reverses string b and converts to int
3. `print(int(a) + b)` - prints the sum of int(a) and the reversed int(b)

So we have: `int(a) + int(b[::-1]) = 1165701527`

Let me denote:
- `a` as a string that converts to integer
- `b` as a string that when reversed and converted to int, gives us the second operand

I need to find values where `int(a) + int(b[::-1]) = 1165701527`

Let me think about reasonable values. Without additional constraints, there are many possible solutions. However, let me consider a simple case:

If `a = "1000000000"` and `b[::-1]` reverses to give `165701527`:
- `int(a) = 1000000000`
- `int(b[::-1]) = 165701527`
- Sum = `1165701527` ✓

So if `int(b[::-1]) = 165701527`, then `b` must be the reverse of "165701527", which is "725107561".

Let me verify:
- `a = "1000000000"`
- `b = "725107561"`
- Input would be: "1000000000 725107561"
- `int(a) = 1000000000`
- `b[::-1] = "165701527"`
- `int(b[::-1]) = 165701527`
- `1000000000 + 165701527 = 1165701527` ✓

This works!
