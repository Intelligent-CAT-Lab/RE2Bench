[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the input.

1. The output is a 2x2 matrix of matrices:
   ```
   [
       ["Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])", "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"],
       ["Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])", "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"]
   ]
   ```

2. The `to_list()` method is called on a `DomainMatrix` object, which delegates to either `DDM.to_list()` or `SDM.to_list()` depending on the `rep` type.

3. Looking at the `SDM.to_list()` implementation:
   - It creates a 2D list of size `m x n`
   - It initializes all elements with the domain's zero
   - It iterates through the sparse representation `M.items()` where each item is `(i, row_dict)`
   - For each row, it iterates through `(j, element)` pairs and fills in the non-zero elements

4. Since the output shows 4 matrices in a 2x2 arrangement, the structure suggests:
   - `shape = (2, 2)` (2 rows, 2 columns at the top level)
   - Each element at position (i, j) is a Matrix object

5. The `rep` in the structure appears to be in sparse format (SDM - Sparse Domain Matrix format), where:
   - Row 0 has columns 0 and 1 with matrices
   - Row 1 has columns 0 and 1 with matrices

6. The rep structure should contain:
   - "0": {"0": Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]]), "1": Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])}
   - "1": {"0": Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]]), "1": Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])}

7. For domain, since we're dealing with Matrix objects, this is likely a domain containing matrices. The domain would need to support these matrix operations.

8. The shape is (2, 2) representing a 2x2 block matrix.
