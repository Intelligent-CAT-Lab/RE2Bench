[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```

This function returns `True` if and only if:
1. `n % 2 == 0` (n is even)
2. `n >= 8` (n is greater than or equal to 8)

Given that the output is `true`, both conditions must be satisfied.

So I need to find a value of `n` such that:
- `n % 2 == 0` (n is even)
- `n >= 8` (n is at least 8)

Any even number >= 8 would work. Examples: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, etc.

The simplest choice would be `n = 8` since:
- `8 % 2 == 0` → True (8 is even)
- `8 >= 8` → True (8 equals 8)
- `True and True` → True ✓

So the input should be `n = 8`.
