[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output of 1.0 to determine what inputs would produce this result.

The function calculates Jaccard similarity:
```
intersection = (a_rows * b_rows).sum() * (a_cols * b_cols).sum()
a_size = a_rows.sum() * a_cols.sum()
b_size = b_rows.sum() * b_cols.sum()
return intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection)
```

For the output to be 1.0, we need:
```
intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection) = 1.0
```

This means:
```
intersection = a_size + b_size - intersection
2 * intersection = a_size + b_size
```

The Jaccard similarity is 1.0 when the two sets are identical (intersection equals both a_size and b_size).

This happens when:
- a_size = b_size = intersection

For this to work, the simplest case is when:
- a_rows and b_rows are identical
- a_cols and b_cols are identical
- All values are non-zero

Let me use simple numpy arrays. If I use arrays of all 1s with the same shape:
- a_rows = [1, 1]
- a_cols = [1, 1]
- b_rows = [1, 1]
- b_cols = [1, 1]

Then:
- intersection = (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 = 4
- a_size = 2 * 2 = 4
- b_size = 2 * 2 = 4
- result = 4 / (4 + 4 - 4) = 4/4 = 1.0 ✓

Alternatively, I could use single element arrays:
- a_rows = [1]
- a_cols = [1]
- b_rows = [1]
- b_cols = [1]

Then:
- intersection = 1 * 1 = 1
- a_size = 1 * 1 = 1
- b_size = 1 * 1 = 1
- result = 1 / (1 + 1 - 1) = 1/1 = 1.0 ✓

I'll go with the single element arrays for simplicity, or I could use numpy arrays of ones. Since the code uses `.sum()`, these need to be array-like objects (likely numpy arrays or lists).

Using lists that when summed give us the right values:
- a_rows = [1]
- a_cols = [1]
- b_rows = [1]
- b_cols = [1]

This is the simplest case where a_rows == b_rows and a_cols == b_cols, making them identical sets.
