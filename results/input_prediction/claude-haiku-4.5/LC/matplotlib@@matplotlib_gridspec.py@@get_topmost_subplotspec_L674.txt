[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_topmost_subplotspec`:

1. The function calls `self.get_gridspec()` which returns `self._gridspec`
2. It then checks if the gridspec has the method `get_topmost_subplotspec`
3. If it does, it calls that method and returns its result
4. If it doesn't, it returns `self` (the SubplotSpec instance)

The output is `"GridSpec(1, 1)[0:1, 0:1]"` which looks like a string representation of a SubplotSpec object.

Since the output is a SubplotSpec representation (indicated by the `[0:1, 0:1]` part which is typical SubplotSpec notation), and the function returns either:
- `gridspec.get_topmost_subplotspec()` if gridspec has that method, OR
- `self` if gridspec doesn't have that method

The output `"GridSpec(1, 1)[0:1, 0:1]"` suggests this is a SubplotSpec object where:
- The underlying gridspec is `GridSpec(1, 1)`
- The slice notation is `[0:1, 0:1]`

For this to be the result, we need a case where either:
1. The gridspec doesn't have `get_topmost_subplotspec` and we return `self`, OR
2. The gridspec has `get_topmost_subplotspec` and it returns this

Given that the output shows a SubplotSpec and we're returning from `get_topmost_subplotspec`, the most likely scenario is that `self._gridspec` doesn't have the `get_topmost_subplotspec` method, so the function returns `self`.

This means:
- `self._gridspec` should be a GridSpec object (like `GridSpec(1, 1)`)
- `self.num1` should be `0` (or `slice(0, 1)` in row)
- `self._num2` should be `0` (or `slice(0, 1)` in column) or None (which would make num2 default to num1)

The `[0:1, 0:1]` notation suggests num1 and num2 are slices representing `0:1` for both row and column indices.

For a simple construction, we need:
- `_gridspec`: A GridSpec(1, 1) object
- `num1`: 0 (which when the SubplotSpec is printed, shows as `[0:1, ...]`)
- `_num2`: None or 0

Let me assume the most straightforward case where num1 and _num2 are both 0 (or _num2 is None making it equal to num1).
