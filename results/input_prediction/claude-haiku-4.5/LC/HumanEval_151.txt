[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `double_the_difference(lst)`:

1. It creates a list comprehension that squares each element `i` in `lst`
2. The conditions for inclusion are:
   - `i > 0` (must be positive)
   - `i % 2 != 0` (must be odd)
   - `'.' not in str(i)` (must not contain a decimal point when converted to string)
3. It sums all the squared values

The output is `0`, which means the sum is 0.

For the sum to be 0, one of these must be true:
- The list is empty
- All elements fail the filtering conditions (none are positive odd integers)
- All elements that pass the filter sum to 0 (impossible since we're squaring positive numbers)

The simplest cases would be:
- Empty list: `[]`
- List with no positive odd integers (e.g., all even numbers, all negative numbers, all floats)
- List with only zero or negative numbers
- List with only even positive numbers
- List with only floats (which contain '.')

Any of these would work. The most straightforward answer is an empty list `[]`, but other valid inputs would be:
- `[2, 4, 6]` (all even)
- `[-1, -3, -5]` (all negative)
- `[1.5, 2.5]` (all floats with decimal points)
- `[0]` (zero doesn't satisfy `i > 0`)

I'll go with the simplest: an empty list.
