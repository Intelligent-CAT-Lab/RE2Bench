[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what input would produce an output of 0.

The code:
1. Reads three integers: k, n, w
2. Calculates sum = k*1 + k*2 + k*3 + ... + k*w = k*(1+2+3+...+w) = k*w*(w+1)/2
3. If sum <= n, prints 0
4. Otherwise prints sum - n

Since the output is 0, we need the condition `sum <= n` to be true.

This means: k*w*(w+1)/2 <= n

Let me think of simple values that satisfy this:
- If k=1, w=1, n=1: sum = 1*1 = 1, and 1 <= 1 is true, so output would be 0 ✓
- If k=1, w=2, n=3: sum = 1*(1+2) = 3, and 3 <= 3 is true, so output would be 0 ✓
- If k=2, w=1, n=2: sum = 2*1 = 2, and 2 <= 2 is true, so output would be 0 ✓

Any of these would work. Let me pick the simplest: k=1, n=1, w=1

Verification:
- k=1, n=1, w=1
- sum = 0
- Loop from i=1 to 1: sum += 1*1 = 1
- sum = 1
- Is 1 <= 1? Yes
- Print 0 ✓

So the input should be "1 1 1"
