[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the input.

Given output: `[5]`

The function `sort_array` has this logic:
1. If array is empty, return `[]`
2. Otherwise, return `sorted(array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)`

Since the output is `[5]` (not empty), the array must have had at least one element.

The output `[5]` is a list with a single element 5. This means:
- Either the input array was `[5]` (single element)
- Or the input array had multiple elements that when sorted (with some reverse parameter) resulted in `[5]`

Let me check if the input could be `[5]`:
- `len([5]) == 1`, so not 0, continue
- `array[0] = 5`, `array[-1] = 5`
- `(5 + 5) % 2 = 10 % 2 = 0`, so `reverse = True`
- `sorted([5], reverse=True) = [5]` ✓

This matches! The output is `[5]`.

But let me also consider if there could be other inputs:
- If input was `[5, 3]`: `(5 + 3) % 2 = 8 % 2 = 0`, so `reverse=True`, giving `sorted([5,3], reverse=True) = [5, 3]` - doesn't match
- If input was `[3, 5]`: `(3 + 5) % 2 = 8 % 2 = 0`, so `reverse=True`, giving `sorted([3,5], reverse=True) = [5, 3]` - doesn't match

So the simplest and most logical input is `[5]`.
