[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `generate_email_pattern` method:

1. The method is defined as `def generate_email_pattern(self):` - it takes only `self` as a parameter
2. Inside the method, it creates a pattern string: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`
3. The method returns this pattern string
4. The output shows: `"\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"`

This matches exactly what the method returns. Since the method takes no parameters other than `self`, and doesn't use any instance variables:
- `self` is an instance of `RegexUtils` (but has no state to specify)
- `args` is empty (no additional arguments)
- `kwargs` is empty (no keyword arguments)

The method always returns the same hardcoded pattern regardless of input, so the input structure should be minimal.
