[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The function `maximum(arr, k)`:
1. If `k == 0`, returns `[]`
2. Sorts the array: `arr.sort()`
3. Returns the last `k` elements: `ans = arr[-k:]`

Given output: `[−4, 4]`

Since the output is `[-4, 4]` (not an empty list), we know that `k ≠ 0`.

The output `[-4, 4]` represents the last `k` elements of the sorted array.
Since we have 2 elements in the output, we know `k = 2`.

Before the sort operation, `arr[-2:]` gives us `[-4, 4]`. This means after sorting, the array ends with `[-4, 4]`.

So the sorted array must end with `[-4, 4]`. The sorted array could be:
- `[-4, 4]` (minimum case)
- `[-5, -4, 4]` (one more element)
- `[-5, -4, 4, 5]` (more elements)
- etc.

The simplest valid input would be an array that when sorted gives us at least `[-4, 4]` at the end.

For example:
- `arr = [-4, 4]` with `k = 2` would work
- `arr = [4, -4]` with `k = 2` would work (unsorted, but after sort becomes [-4, 4])
- `arr = [-4, 4, 1, 2]` with `k = 2` would give `[4]` - doesn't match
- Actually, if `arr = [-4, 4, 1, 2]`, after sorting: `[-4, 1, 2, 4]`, then `arr[-2:]` = `[2, 4]` - doesn't match

Let me reconsider. If sorted array's last 2 elements are `[-4, 4]`, the simplest case is `arr = [-4, 4]`.

Let me verify: 
- `arr = [-4, 4]`, `k = 2`
- After sort: `[-4, 4]`
- `arr[-2:]` = `[-4, 4]` ✓

This matches the output!
