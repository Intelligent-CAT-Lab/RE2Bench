[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add_argument` method to determine what input would produce the given state.

The method signature is:
```python
def add_argument(self, arg, required=False, arg_type=str):
    if required:
        self.required.add(arg)
    self.types[arg] = arg_type
```

Looking at the final state in the structure:
- `self.arguments = {}` (unchanged from init)
- `self.required = XXX` (need to determine)
- `self.types = {"name": XXX, "age": XXX}` (has two entries)

Since `self.types` has two entries ("name" and "age"), the method must have been called twice - once with arg="name" and once with arg="age".

For each call:
1. First call: `add_argument("name", required=?, arg_type=?)`
   - This adds `"name"` to `self.types[arg]`
   
2. Second call: `add_argument("age", required=?, arg_type=?)`
   - This adds `"age"` to `self.types[arg]`

Now, what are the types? The parameter `arg_type` defaults to `str`. Since we don't see any indication that non-default types were used, both should be `str`.

For `self.required`: if required=True, the arg is added to self.required. If required=False (default), nothing is added. The structure shows `self.required = XXX`, which could be an empty set or a set with some entries.

Since we're looking at the output after calling `add_argument` potentially multiple times, and the structure shows "name" and "age" in types, but doesn't specify what's in required, the most likely scenario is:
- Both calls used `required=False` (default), so `self.required` would be empty set `set()`
- Both calls used default `arg_type=str`

However, the structure seems to be asking for a single call to `add_argument`. Looking more carefully, the output shows `null`, meaning the method returns None (which all methods do implicitly).

Given the structure format with "args" and "kwargs", this appears to be asking for a single method call. But the types dict has two keys. This is contradictory unless we're meant to represent the state after multiple calls as a single input format.

Most logically: the `self` state shown is the state AFTER calling the method, and we need to determine what arguments would lead to THIS state. Since types has both "name" and "age", we need at least two calls. But the input structure suggests one call.

Let me reconsider: perhaps the structure is showing the final state, and I need to predict what calls were made. But I can only predict one call based on the input structure provided.

If this is asking for the last call that created this state, and both "name" and "age" are in types, then perhaps the second call was with "age". That call would have been:
- arg = "age"
- required = False (likely default)
- arg_type = str (likely default)

And self.required would be empty set if both calls had required=False.

For the types values, they should both be `str` (the type object itself, not the string "str").
