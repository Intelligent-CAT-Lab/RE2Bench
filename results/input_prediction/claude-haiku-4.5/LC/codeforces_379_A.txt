Let me trace through this code backwards from the output.

The output is `h = 80`.

Let's understand what the code does:
1. `a, b = map(int, input().split())` - reads two integers
2. `x = a`, `h = 0`, `s = 0`
3. First while loop: `while x > 0:` decrements x, increments h and s each time. This runs `a` times, so after this loop: `h = a`, `s = a`
4. Second while loop: `while s // b != 0:` continues while `s // b` is not 0 (i.e., while `s >= b`). Each iteration: `h += 1` and `s = s - b + 1`

Let me denote the final output as `h = 80`.

After the first loop: `h = a`, `s = a`

In the second loop, each iteration:
- `h` increases by 1
- `s` becomes `s - b + 1`

Let's say the second loop runs `k` times. Then:
- Final `h = a + k = 80`
- Final `s` would be: `a - k*b + k = a - k(b-1)`
- The loop stops when `s // b == 0`, meaning `s < b`

So we need: `a - k(b-1) < b` and before this iteration `a - (k-1)(b-1) >= b`

From `a + k = 80`, we have `k = 80 - a`.

For the loop condition to end: `s < b`, meaning:
`a - (80-a)(b-1) < b`
`a - (80-a)(b-1) < b`

And the loop should have executed, meaning before stopping:
`a >= b` (initial condition for loop to run at least once)

Let me try some values. Let's try `a = 70, b = 10`:
- After first loop: `h = 70, s = 70`
- First iteration: `s >= b` (70 >= 10, yes), so `h = 71, s = 70 - 10 + 1 = 61`
- Continue while `s // b != 0`: `61 // 10 = 6`, yes
- Continue: `h = 72, s = 61 - 10 + 1 = 52`
- `52 // 10 = 5`, yes
- Continue: `h = 73, s = 52 - 10 + 1 = 43`
- `43 // 10 = 4`, yes
- Continue: `h = 74, s = 43 - 10 + 1 = 34`
- `34 // 10 = 3`, yes
- Continue: `h = 75, s = 34 - 10 + 1 = 25`
- `25 // 10 = 2`, yes
- Continue: `h = 76, s = 25 - 10 + 1 = 16`
- `16 // 10 = 1`, yes
- Continue: `h = 77, s = 16 - 10 + 1 = 7`
- `7 // 10 = 0`, no - loop stops

Final `h = 77`, not 80.

Let me try `a = 73, b = 10`:
- After first loop: `h = 73, s = 73`
- Each iteration reduces s by 9 and increases h by 1
- Need `s < 10` to stop
- `73 - 9k < 10` means `9k > 63`, so `k > 7`, minimum `k = 8`
- After 8 iterations: `h = 73 + 8 = 81`, `s = 73 - 72 = 1`
- Check: `1 // 10 = 0`, loop stops. Final `h = 81`

Let me try `a = 72, b = 10`:
- After first loop: `h = 72, s = 72`
- `72 - 9k < 10` means `9k > 62`, so `k >= 7`
- After 7 iterations: `h = 72 + 7 = 79`, `s = 72 - 63 = 9`
- Check: `9 // 10 = 0`, loop stops. Final `h = 79`

Let me try `a = 73, b = 9`:
- After first loop: `h = 73, s = 73`
- Each iteration reduces s by 8 and increases h by 1
- `73 - 8k < 9` means `8k > 64`, so `k > 8`, minimum `k = 9`
- After 9 iterations: `h = 73 + 9 = 82`, too high

Let me try `a = 72, b = 9`:
- `72 - 8k < 9` means `8k > 63`, so `k >= 8`
- After 8 iterations: `h = 72 + 8 = 80`, `s = 72 - 64 = 8`
- Check: `8 // 9 = 0`, loop stops. Final `h = 80` ✓

So `a = 72, b = 9` works!
