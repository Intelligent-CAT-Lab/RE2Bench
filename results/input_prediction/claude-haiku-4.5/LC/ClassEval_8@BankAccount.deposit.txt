Let me trace through the `deposit` method:

1. The method takes an `amount` parameter
2. It checks if `amount < 0`, and raises ValueError if true
3. It adds `amount` to `self.balance`
4. It returns `self.balance`

Given that the output is 300, this means:
- After the deposit operation: `self.balance = 300`

So I need to find what `self.balance` was before and what `amount` was deposited.

The equation is: `self.balance + amount = 300`

There are multiple valid combinations:
- balance=0, amount=300
- balance=100, amount=200
- balance=150, amount=150
- balance=200, amount=100
- etc.

However, looking at the `__init__` method, the default balance is 0. The most straightforward and common test case would be starting with an initial balance and depositing an amount.

A reasonable assumption is:
- Initial balance = 0 (default)
- Amount deposited = 300
- Final balance = 0 + 300 = 300

This is the simplest and most typical scenario.
