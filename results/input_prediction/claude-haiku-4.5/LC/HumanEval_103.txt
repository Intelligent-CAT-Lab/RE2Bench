Let me work backwards from the output to find the inputs.

The output is "0b101101110", which is a binary string representation.

The `bin()` function converts a number to binary. So I need to find what number was passed to `bin()`.

"0b101101110" in binary equals:
0*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^6 + 0*2^7 + 1*2^8
= 0 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 0 + 32 + 64 + 0 + 256
= 366

So `round(summation / (m - n + 1))` must equal 366.

This means: `summation / (m - n + 1) ≈ 366`

The summation is the sum of integers from n to m (inclusive):
`summation = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + ... + m`

Using the arithmetic series formula:
`summation = (m - n + 1) * (n + m) / 2`

So: `(m - n + 1) * (n + m) / 2 / (m - n + 1) = (n + m) / 2 = 366`

Therefore: `n + m = 732`

Now I need to find specific values of n and m that satisfy this. The problem doesn't uniquely determine n and m, but I need to pick values where m ≥ n (otherwise the function returns -1).

Let me try some reasonable values. A simple choice would be n=0, m=732, but let me verify:
- summation = sum from 0 to 732 = 732*733/2 = 268356
- count = 732 - 0 + 1 = 733
- average = 268356 / 733 = 366.0
- round(366.0) = 366 ✓
- bin(366) = "0b101101110" ✓

Let me verify this is correct by checking: 366 in binary
366 = 256 + 110 = 256 + 64 + 46 = 256 + 64 + 32 + 14 = 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2
= 2^8 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
= 101101110 in binary
So "0b101101110" ✓

Therefore, n=0 and m=732 works.
