[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce the output "bcdf\nghjklm".

The function `remove_vowels` iterates through each character in the input text and keeps only those characters whose lowercase version is NOT in the list ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'].

Given output: "bcdf\nghjklm"

This means:
- 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f' are kept (consonants)
- '\n' is kept (it's not a vowel)
- 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm' are kept (consonants)

So the input must have contained these characters in this order, potentially with vowels interspersed that would be removed.

The simplest reconstruction would be to insert vowels back into the output. Looking at the pattern:
- "bcdf" - could be from "abcdef" or similar with vowels removed
- "\n" - this is preserved as-is
- "ghjklm" - could be from "aghijklmn" or similar with vowels removed

A logical input could be: "abcdef\naghijklmn"
- 'a' removed (vowel)
- 'b' kept → 'b'
- 'c' kept → 'c'
- 'd' kept → 'd'
- 'e' removed (vowel)
- 'f' kept → 'f'
- '\n' kept → '\n'
- 'a' removed (vowel)
- 'g' kept → 'g'
- 'h' kept → 'h'
- 'i' removed (vowel)
- 'j' kept → 'j'
- 'k' kept → 'k'
- 'l' kept → 'l'
- 'm' kept → 'm'
- 'n' removed (vowel)

This gives: "bcdf\nghjklm" ✓

This matches the expected output!
