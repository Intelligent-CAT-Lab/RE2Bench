[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution step by step.

The function `f(num)` does two things:
1. `num.append(num[-1])` - appends the last element of the list to itself
2. `return num` - returns the modified list

Given the output is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`, I need to work backwards.

After the function executes, we have `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.

Before the `append` operation, the list was `[-70, 20, 9, 1]` (without the last element that was appended).

The append operation does: `num.append(num[-1])`

So `num[-1]` before the append must equal the last element added, which is `1`.

Looking at the list before append: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`, the last element `num[-1]` is indeed `1`.

This confirms that the input list must have been `[-70, 20, 9, 1]` before the function was called.

Let me verify: if we start with `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`, then `num[-1]` is `1`, and after `append(1)` we get `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`, which matches the output.
