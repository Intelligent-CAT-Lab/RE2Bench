Let me trace through the `_new` method execution:

1. The output shows:
   - `_shape`: {} (empty dict, but should be a Tuple)
   - `_array`: null (None)
   - `_rank`: 2
   - `_loop_size`: "4" (string "4")

2. Looking at the code:
   - `shape = Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))` → `_shape` becomes a Tuple
   - `flat_list = Tuple(*flat_list)` → should be a Tuple but output shows null for `_array`
   - `self._rank = len(shape)` → equals 2, so shape has length 2
   - `self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, shape, 1)` → equals "4" (as string)

3. For `_rank = 2` and `_loop_size = "4"`:
   - If shape is (2, 2), then len(shape) = 2 and reduce product = 2*2 = 4
   - This matches!

4. The iterable needs to flatten to a list with 4 elements (since _loop_size is "4").

5. The input structure shows iterable has `rows`, `cols`, `_mat` - this looks like a Matrix object:
   - A 2x2 Matrix would have rows=2, cols=2, and _mat containing 4 elements

6. For shape to work with reduce giving "4":
   - shape = [2, 2] or (2, 2) would give len=2 and product=4

7. The _array being null in output seems odd, but let me assume a 2x2 matrix as input.

Let me construct:
- iterable: A 2x2 matrix (rows=2, cols=2, _mat=[element1, element2, element3, element4])
- shape: [2, 2] or (2, 2)

Since _loop_size = "4" (a string), and the reduce operation would normally produce an int, the output representation may be stringified. The actual result should be 2*2=4.

For a minimal 2x2 matrix, I'll use:
- rows: 2
- cols: 2  
- _mat: [0, 0, 0, 0] or similar 4-element list

shape should be (2, 2) to produce _rank=2 and _loop_size=4.
