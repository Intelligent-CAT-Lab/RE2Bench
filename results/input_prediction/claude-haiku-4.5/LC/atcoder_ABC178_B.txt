Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The output is: 56183721947132200

The code does:
1. Read 4 integers: a, b, c, d
2. Calculate: ans = max(a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d)
3. Print ans

So I need to find a, b, c, d such that max(a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d) = 56183721947132200

The maximum of these four products will be one of them. Let me think about what values could work.

If the answer is 56183721947132200, I need to find four numbers whose products can yield this value.

Let me try to factor this large number or think of reasonable values:
56183721947132200 

One approach: let's assume simple values that multiply to give this result.
If a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4: max(1*3, 1*4, 2*3, 2*4) = max(3, 4, 6, 8) = 8 (too small)

I need much larger numbers. Let me try:
- If a = 7487829593, b = 7487829594, c = 7487829595, d = 7487829596
- Then a * d = 7487829593 * 7487829596 would be around 56 * 10^15

Actually, let me try simpler factors:
56183721947132200 could be factored as, for example:
- 200000000 * 280918609735661 or similar combinations

Let me try: a = 223500000, b = 223500001, c = 251500000, d = 251500001
Actually, that's getting too complex.

Let me try a simpler approach: what if two of these numbers are small and two are large?
For instance: a = 1, b = 2, c = 10, d = 56183721947132200
Then max(1*10, 1*56183721947132200, 2*10, 2*56183721947132200) = 112367443894264400 (too large)

What if: a = 7487829593, b = 7487829594, c = 7487829595, d = 7487829596?
a * d ≈ 7.5 * 10^9 * 7.5 * 10^9 ≈ 56 * 10^18 (way too large)

Let me try smaller numbers: a = 7487829, b = 7487830, c = 7500000, d = 7500001
a * d = 7487829 * 7500001 ≈ 56 * 10^12 (getting closer)

Actually: 7487829 * 7500001 = 56158717529
That's not right either.

Let me reconsider: 56183721947132200
What if a = 200000000, b = 200000001, c = 280918609, d = 280918610?
a * d = 200000000 * 280918610 = 56183722000000000 (very close!)

More precisely: a = 200000000, b = 200000001, c = 280918609, d = 280918610
a * d = 200000000 * 280918610 = 56183722000000000 (still slightly off)

Let me try: a = 237789, b = 237790, c = 236299, d = 236300
Actually this is quite tedious. Let me try: a = 7487829593, b = 7487829594, c = 7500000, d = 7500001
Hmm, but these products would be enormous.

Let me try a simpler set: a = 7500000, b = 7500001, c = 7487829, d = 7487830
b * d = 7500001 * 7487830 = 56158718230830 (close but not exact)

After analysis, let me try: a = 7487829593, b = 7487829594, c = 7500, d = 7501
That would be way too small.

Let me try: a = 237000000, b = 237000001, c = 237000000, d = 237000001
But that's symmetric.

I'll try: a = 223606800, b = 223606801, c = 251188, d = 251189
This is getting speculative. Let me assume reasonable integer values:
a = 7487829593, b = 7487829594, c = 7500000, d = 7500001

Actually, let me just try: "7487829593 7487829594 7500000 7500001" or similar round numbers that would give ~5.6 * 10^16
