[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function with the given output.

The function returns a tuple: `(max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None)`

Given output is `[-1, null]` which means:
- First element (max of negative numbers): -1
- Second element (min of positive numbers): null (None)

For the first element to be -1:
- `smallest` must not be empty (otherwise it would return None)
- `max(smallest)` must equal -1
- `smallest` contains all elements where `x < 0` from the input list
- So the list must contain at least one negative number, and -1 must be the maximum (closest to 0) among negative numbers

For the second element to be None:
- `largest` must be empty (otherwise it would return `min(largest)`)
- `largest` contains all elements where `x > 0` from the input list
- So the list must contain no positive numbers

Therefore, the input list must:
1. Contain at least -1 as a negative number
2. Contain no positive numbers
3. Possibly contain 0 (since 0 is not < 0 and not > 0, it would be filtered out)

A simple input that satisfies this is: `[-1]` or `[-1, 0]` or `[-5, -1]` or similar combinations.

The simplest would be `[-1]` which would give:
- smallest = [-1]
- largest = []
- max(smallest) = -1
- min(largest) = None (because largest is empty)
- return (-1, None)

This matches the output [−1, null].
