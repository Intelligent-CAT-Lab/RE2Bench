[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `any_int(x, y, z)` to understand what inputs would produce `True`.

For the function to return `True`:
1. All three parameters must be integers: `isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)` must be True
2. At least one of these conditions must be true:
   - `x + y == z`
   - `x + z == y`
   - `y + z == x`

So I need to find integer values x, y, z where at least one of these three equations holds.

Let me pick simple values:
- If x = 1, y = 2, z = 3:
  - x + y == z? → 1 + 2 == 3? → 3 == 3? → True ✓
  
This works! The function would return True because:
1. All three are integers
2. The first condition (x + y == z) is satisfied (1 + 2 == 3)

So the function returns True before checking the other conditions.

Other valid examples could be:
- x = 5, y = 3, z = 8 (5 + 3 == 8)
- x = 10, y = 5, z = 15 (10 + 5 == 15)
- x = 2, y = 3, z = 5 (2 + 3 == 5)

I'll use the simplest: x = 1, y = 2, z = 3
