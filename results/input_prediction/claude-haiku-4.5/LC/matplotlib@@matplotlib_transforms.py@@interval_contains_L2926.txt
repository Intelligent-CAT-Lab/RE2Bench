[THOUGHT]
1. The function `interval_contains` returns a boolean value indicating whether `val` is contained within the `interval`.

2. The output is `"np.True_"`, which represents a numpy boolean True value. This means the function returned True.

3. For the function to return True, the condition `a <= val <= b` must be satisfied (after potentially swapping a and b if a > b).

4. I need to find values for `interval` and `val` such that the function returns True.

5. Let me trace through the logic:
   - `interval` is a tuple/list with two elements (a, b)
   - If a > b, they are swapped
   - Then it checks if a <= val <= b
   - For this to return True, val must be between the two values (inclusive)

6. A simple example would be:
   - interval = (1, 5) with val = 3: a=1, b=5, check 1 <= 3 <= 5 → True
   - Or interval = (5, 1) with val = 3: a=5, b=1, swap to a=1, b=5, check 1 <= 3 <= 5 → True
   - Or interval = (0, 10) with val = 5: a=0, b=10, check 0 <= 5 <= 10 → True

7. I'll use a simple case: interval = (0, 10) and val = 5
