[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The code does:
```python
print(input().replace(',', ' '))
```

This means:
1. It reads an input string
2. It replaces all commas (',') with spaces (' ')
3. It prints the result

Given output: `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`

This output contains spaces but no commas. So the replacement operation converted commas to spaces.

Working backwards:
- The output is `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`
- Every space in the output came from a comma in the input
- There are 2 spaces in the output

Therefore, the input must have had commas where the spaces are in the output:
- `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`

Let me verify:
- Input: `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`
- After `.replace(',', ' ')`: `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`
- After `print()`: outputs `avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc` ✓

This matches the expected output.
