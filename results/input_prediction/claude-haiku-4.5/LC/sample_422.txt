[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution backwards from the output.

The function:
1. Makes a copy of the array
2. Reverses it
3. Returns a list comprehension that squares each element

Given output: [1, 4, 1]

This means after reversing and squaring, we got [1, 4, 1].

Working backwards:
- If [x * x for x in reversed_array] = [1, 4, 1]
- Then the reversed_array must have been [1, 2, 1] or [-1, 2, -1] or [-1, -2, -1] etc. (values whose squares are 1, 4, 1)
- Since we need x² = 1, x could be ±1
- Since we need x² = 4, x could be ±2
- Since we need x² = 1, x could be ±1

So reversed_array could be [1, 2, 1] or [-1, 2, -1] or [1, -2, 1] or [-1, -2, -1].

Before reversing, if reversed_array = [1, 2, 1], then the original array was [1, 2, 1] (same because it's palindromic).
Before reversing, if reversed_array = [-1, 2, -1], then the original array was [-1, 2, -1] (palindromic).
Before reversing, if reversed_array = [1, -2, 1], then the original array was [1, -2, 1] (palindromic).
Before reversing, if reversed_array = [-1, -2, -1], then the original array was [-1, -2, -1] (palindromic).

Actually, let me reconsider. If the original array is [a, b, c], after reversing it becomes [c, b, a]. After squaring: [c², b², a²].

Given output [1, 4, 1]:
- c² = 1 → c = ±1
- b² = 4 → b = ±2
- a² = 1 → a = ±1

So the original array could be [±1, ±2, ±1].

The simplest and most likely answer is [1, 2, 1] or [-1, -2, -1]. Let me go with the positive version [1, 2, 1].

Let me verify: 
- array = [1, 2, 1]
- new_array = [1, 2, 1] (copy)
- new_array reversed = [1, 2, 1]
- [x*x for x in [1, 2, 1]] = [1, 4, 1] ✓

This matches the output.
