[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code backwards from the output "x. x".

The last operation before print is:
```
for i in t:
    s = s.replace(' ' + i, i)
```
where t = ',.?!'

This removes spaces before punctuation marks. So before this loop, s must have been "x . x" (with a space before the period).

Before that loop, we have:
```
s = ' '.join(s.strip().split())
```
This normalizes whitespace by stripping and splitting on whitespace, then joining with single spaces. So before this, s could have been "x . x" or had extra whitespace.

Before that, we have:
```
for i in t:
    s = s.replace(i, i + ' ')
```
This adds a space after each punctuation mark. So this transforms each punctuation character into itself plus a space.

So if the final output is "x. x", let me work backwards:
- After last loop: "x. x" (spaces before punctuation removed)
- Before last loop: "x . x" (space before the period)
- After join/strip: "x . x" (normalized whitespace)
- Before first loop: This is where punctuation gets space added after it.

If we had "x.x" as input to the first loop:
- After first loop with i='.': "x. x"
- After strip().split(): "x. x" → ["x.", "x"] → joined: "x. x"
- Wait, that doesn't work correctly.

Let me reconsider. If input is "x.x":
- First loop adds space after '.': "x. x"
- strip() and split(): "x. x" → ["x.", "x"] → join with ' ': "x. x"
- Last loop removes space before '.': no ' .' found, so stays "x. x"
- Output: "x. x" ✓

Let me verify this works:
1. s = "x.x"
2. First loop: s.replace('.', '. ') → "x. x"
3. s.strip().split() → ["x.", "x"]
4. ' '.join(...) → "x. x"
5. Last loop: s.replace(' .', '.') → no match, stays "x. x"
6. print("x. x")

This matches the expected output!
