[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `f(array, index)` to understand what inputs would produce an output of `1`.

The function does the following:
1. If `index < 0`, it converts the index to a positive index by adding the length of the array: `index = len(array) + index`
2. Returns `array[index]`

For the output to be `1`, we need `array[index]` to equal `1`.

Since we don't know if the index was negative or positive initially, let me consider both cases:

Case 1: index >= 0 (no adjustment needed)
- We need `array[index] = 1`
- For example: `array = [1]` with `index = 0`, or `array = [0, 1]` with `index = 1`, etc.

Case 2: index < 0 (adjustment happens)
- After adjustment: `index = len(array) + index`
- We still need `array[index] = 1` after this adjustment
- For example: `array = [1, 2]` with `index = -2` would become `index = 2 + (-2) = 0`, so `array[0] = 1`

The simplest solution would be:
- `array = [1]` and `index = 0` (no negative index needed)

Or equivalently:
- `array = [1, 2]` and `index = -2` (which adjusts to `index = 0`)

I'll go with the simplest case: `array = [1]` and `index = 0`
