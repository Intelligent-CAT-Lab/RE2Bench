[THOUGHT]
We need to find the octal number that converts to decimal 21271.

The function `octal_to_decimal` uses `int(octal_num, 8)` to convert an octal string to decimal.

So we need to find what octal number, when converted to decimal, gives us 21271.

To convert decimal to octal, we can repeatedly divide by 8:
21271 ÷ 8 = 2658 remainder 7
2658 ÷ 8 = 332 remainder 2
332 ÷ 8 = 41 remainder 4
41 ÷ 8 = 5 remainder 1
5 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top: 51427

Let's verify: 51427 in octal to decimal:
5×8⁴ + 1×8³ + 4×8² + 2×8¹ + 7×8⁰
= 5×4096 + 1×512 + 4×64 + 2×8 + 7×1
= 20480 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7
= 21271 ✓

So the octal_num input should be "51427" (as a string, since int() function expects a string when a base is specified).
