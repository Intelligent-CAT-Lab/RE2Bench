[THOUGHT]
The function `construct_stop_word_list` is a method that takes no arguments (besides `self`). It creates a list with three string elements: `['a', 'an', 'the']` and returns it.

The output shows exactly this list: `["a", "an", "the"]`.

Since this function:
1. Takes no arguments other than `self`
2. Has no parameters defined besides `self`
3. Has no `args` or `kwargs` in the function signature

The input should have:
- `self` as an empty dictionary (no instance variables are used by this method)
- `args` as an empty dictionary (no positional arguments)
- `kwargs` as an empty dictionary (no keyword arguments)
