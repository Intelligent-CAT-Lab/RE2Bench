[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `total` method to determine what input would produce an output of 250.0.

The `total` method calculates:
```python
self.__total = sum((item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.cart))
```

So it sums up `quantity * price` for each item in the cart.

Given that the output is 250.0, I need to find a cart that sums to 250.0.

Some possible combinations:
- One item: quantity=1, price=250.0 → 1 * 250.0 = 250.0
- One item: quantity=5, price=50.0 → 5 * 50.0 = 250.0
- Multiple items: quantity=2, price=100.0 and quantity=1, price=50.0 → (2*100.0) + (1*50.0) = 200.0 + 50.0 = 250.0

I'll use a simple single-item cart for clarity:
- cart = [{'quantity': 5, 'price': 50.0}]

This gives: 5 * 50.0 = 250.0 ✓

For the customer object, since it's not used in the `total` method, I can use any reasonable values:
- customer = {"name": "John Doe", "fidelity": 1000}

For promotion, since it's not used in the `total` method, it can be None.

Let me verify: sum((5 * 50.0 for item in [{'quantity': 5, 'price': 50.0}])) = 250.0 ✓
