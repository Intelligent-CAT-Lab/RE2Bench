[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

Given output: 18000

The function has two cases:
1. If n == 1, return 1
2. Otherwise, return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)

Since the output is 18000 (not 1), we know n ≠ 1, so we're in the second case.

We need to solve: 18 * 10 ** (n - 2) = 18000

Dividing both sides by 18:
10 ** (n - 2) = 1000

Since 1000 = 10^3, we have:
10 ** (n - 2) = 10 ** 3

Therefore:
n - 2 = 3
n = 5

Let me verify: 18 * 10 ** (5 - 2) = 18 * 10 ** 3 = 18 * 1000 = 18000 ✓

So n = 5
