[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution:

1. The function `f` takes an `array` as input
2. It creates `just_ns` by mapping each number in `array` to a string of 'n' repeated that many times
3. It then creates `final_output` as an empty list
4. It iterates through `just_ns` and appends each element to `final_output`
5. It returns `final_output`

Given the output is an empty list `[]`, I need to work backwards:
- `final_output` is returned as `[]`
- For `final_output` to be empty after the loop, `just_ns` must be empty
- For `just_ns` to be empty after `map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array)`, the `array` must be empty
- An empty array would result in `map` producing an empty iterator, which when converted to a list gives `[]`
- Then the for loop `for wipe in just_ns:` would not execute (since `just_ns` is empty)
- So `final_output` remains `[]`

Therefore, `array` must be an empty list `[]`.
