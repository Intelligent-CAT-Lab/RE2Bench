[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `__invert__` method:

```python
def __invert__(self):
    return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))
```

The method:
1. Takes `self._array_form` 
2. Passes it to `_af_invert()` function
3. Passes the result to `self._af_new()` constructor
4. Returns a new Permutation object

The output shows:
```
{
    "_array_form": null,
    "_size": 5
}
```

This is the result of calling `__invert__` on a Permutation object. The output shows the resulting Permutation has:
- `_array_form`: null
- `_size`: 5

For the input `self`:
- `self._size` should be 5 (the size is preserved or matches)
- `self._array_form` needs to be something that when inverted produces `_array_form: null`

Looking at the code, `_af_new` is defined as `Perm._af_new` which creates a new Permutation from an array form. If the result has `_array_form: null`, it suggests that either:
1. The inversion resulted in no array form being set initially, or
2. The `_af_new` method doesn't set `_array_form` directly from the input

However, since `__invert__` is calling `self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`, the input `self._array_form` must be something that `_af_invert` can process.

Given that the output has `_size: 5`, the input should have `_size: 5` as well.

For `_array_form`, it could be any valid array form for a permutation of size 5. A common representation would be something like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (identity) or any permutation array of length 5.

Since the output shows `_array_form: null`, this might indicate the Permutation object wasn't fully initialized. But for the input, we need a valid `_array_form` to be inverted.

Let me assume a simple case: the identity permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` for size 5, which when inverted gives itself with `_array_form: null` in the output representation (perhaps lazy evaluation).

Actually, looking more carefully, the output format shows `_array_form: null`, which might be how uninitialized or lazy-evaluated permutations are represented in the output format.

For the input, I'll use a reasonable permutation array of size 5. Let's use `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (identity permutation).
