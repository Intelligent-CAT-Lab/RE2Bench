Let me analyze the function step by step.

The function `compare` takes two arguments `game` and `guess`, and returns a list where each element is the absolute difference between corresponding elements from `game` and `guess`.

The output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.

This means:
- `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`
- `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0`
- `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0`
- `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`

From the second element: `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0` means `game[1] = guess[1]`

From the third element: `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0` means `game[2] = guess[2]`

For the first element: `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2` could be:
- `game[0] = 5, guess[0] = 3` (difference = 2)
- `game[0] = 3, guess[0] = 5` (difference = 2)
- Or many other combinations like `game[0] = 2, guess[0] = 0` or `game[0] = 0, guess[0] = 2`

For the fourth element: `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1` could be:
- `game[3] = 5, guess[3] = 4` (difference = 1)
- `game[3] = 4, guess[3] = 5` (difference = 1)
- Or many other combinations

Since there are multiple valid solutions, I'll choose simple values:
- For first element with difference 2: `game[0] = 2, guess[0] = 0` (or any other pair with difference 2)
- For second and third elements with difference 0: `game[1] = guess[1]` and `game[2] = guess[2]`, I'll use `game[1] = guess[1] = 1` and `game[2] = guess[2] = 1`
- For fourth element with difference 1: `game[3] = 5, guess[3] = 4` (or any other pair with difference 1)

So one valid input could be:
`game = [2, 1, 1, 5]` and `guess = [0, 1, 1, 4]`

Let me verify:
- `abs(2 - 0) = 2` ✓
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0` ✓
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0` ✓
- `abs(5 - 4) = 1` ✓

This works!
