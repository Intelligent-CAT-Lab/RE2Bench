[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step:

1. `stdin = input()` - reads a string from input
2. `s = stdin` - assigns that string to variable s
3. `result = 'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'` - this checks if both 'A' and 'B' are present in the string s
4. `print(result)` - prints the result

Given that the output is `"Yes"`, this means the condition `'A' in s and 'B' in s` must be `True`.

Therefore, the input string `s` must contain both the character 'A' and the character 'B'.

The simplest input that would produce "Yes" would be any string containing both 'A' and 'B'. For example: "AB", "BA", "ABC", "BAA", etc.

Since we need to provide an input that produces this output, any string containing both 'A' and 'B' will work. I'll use a simple one: "AB"
