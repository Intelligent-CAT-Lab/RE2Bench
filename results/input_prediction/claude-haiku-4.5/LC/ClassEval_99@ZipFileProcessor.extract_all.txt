Let me trace through the `extract_all` method:

1. The method tries to open a file using `zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r')`
2. If successful, it extracts all contents to `output_path` and returns `True`
3. If any exception occurs, it returns `False`

Since the output is `false`, this means an exception was caught in the try-except block.

There are several scenarios that could cause an exception:
- The `file_name` does not exist
- The `file_name` is not a valid zip file
- The `output_path` is invalid or inaccessible
- The `file_name` is `None` or an invalid type
- Permission issues

The most straightforward case would be that either:
1. The file doesn't exist at the given path
2. The file is not a valid zip file
3. The output_path is invalid

Common test cases for this would be:
- A non-existent file like "nonexistent.zip"
- An invalid zip file
- An invalid output path

Since we're looking for input that produces `False`, any of these would work. The simplest case would be providing a file that doesn't exist or isn't a valid zip file.

Let me go with a common scenario: trying to extract from a file that doesn't exist or is not a valid zip file. For example:
- `file_name` could be "nonexistent.zip" or "invalid.zip" or an empty string
- `output_path` could be any valid path like "/tmp/" or "."

A reasonable prediction would be:
- `file_name`: "nonexistent.zip" (file doesn't exist, causing ZipFile to raise an exception)
- `output_path`: any valid path like "." or "/tmp/"
