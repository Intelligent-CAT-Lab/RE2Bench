The `subtract` method takes two complex numbers `c1` and `c2` and returns their difference.

The output is `(2-2j)`, which represents the complex number 2 - 2j.

The formula used is:
- real = c1.real - c2.real
- imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag
- result = complex(real, imaginary)

So we need: real = 2 and imaginary = -2

We need to find c1 and c2 such that:
- c1.real - c2.real = 2
- c1.imag - c2.imag = -2

There are multiple valid solutions. A simple one would be:
- c1 = 2 + 0j (or just 2)
- c2 = 0 + 2j (or just 2j)

Let me verify:
- real: 2 - 0 = 2 ✓
- imaginary: 0 - 2 = -2 ✓
- result: complex(2, -2) = (2-2j) ✓

Another valid solution could be:
- c1 = 5 + 3j
- c2 = 3 + 5j

Let me verify:
- real: 5 - 3 = 2 ✓
- imaginary: 3 - 5 = -2 ✓
- result: complex(2, -2) = (2-2j) ✓

I'll go with the simpler first solution: c1 = (2+0j) and c2 = (0+2j)
