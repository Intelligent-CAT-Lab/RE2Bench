[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. `A, B = map(int, input().split())` - reads two integers from input
2. `ans = A - 2 * B` - calculates the difference
3. `if ans < 0: ans = 0` - if the result is negative, set it to 0
4. `print(ans)` - prints the result

The output is `0`.

This means either:
- `A - 2 * B = 0`, so `ans = 0` (and the if condition doesn't change it)
- `A - 2 * B < 0`, so the if condition sets `ans = 0`

In both cases, the final output is 0.

Let me consider what values of A and B would work:
- If `A - 2 * B = 0`, then `A = 2 * B`. For example: A=2, B=1 or A=4, B=2, etc.
- If `A - 2 * B < 0`, then `A < 2 * B`. For example: A=1, B=1 (1-2=-1→0) or A=0, B=1, etc.

Any combination where `A ≤ 2 * B` will produce output 0.

A simple example would be: A=0, B=0
- `ans = 0 - 2*0 = 0`
- `ans` is not < 0, so it stays 0
- Output: 0

Another example: A=1, B=1
- `ans = 1 - 2*1 = -1`
- `ans < 0` is true, so `ans = 0`
- Output: 0

Both work. I'll go with a simple case like "0 0" or "1 1".
