[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what input would produce "NO" as output.

The code:
1. Reads an integer `n`
2. While `n` is even (n % 2 == 0), divides `n` by 2
3. If `n == 1` after the loop, prints "YES"
4. Otherwise prints "NO"

For the output to be "NO", we need `n != 1` after the while loop completes.

The while loop removes all factors of 2 from `n`. So after the loop:
- If the original `n` was a power of 2 (like 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), then `n` becomes 1, and we print "YES"
- If the original `n` had any odd factors (like 3, 5, 7, etc.), then `n` will equal that odd factor, and we print "NO"

Since we need "NO", the original input must not be a power of 2. It must have at least one odd factor greater than 1.

Some examples that would work:
- 3 (odd, stays 3 after loop, prints "NO")
- 6 (6/2 = 3, loop stops, n=3, prints "NO")
- 12 (12/2 = 6, 6/2 = 3, loop stops, n=3, prints "NO")
- 5 (odd, stays 5, prints "NO")
- Any number that is not a power of 2

The simplest example would be a small odd number like 3 or 5. Let me pick 3.

If input is "3":
- n = 3
- 3 % 2 == 0? No, so skip the while loop
- n == 1? No (n is 3)
- Print "NO" ✓

This matches the expected output.
