[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `write_csv` method:

1. The function returns 1 on success (when the file is written without exception)
2. The function returns 0 on exception (if file writing fails)
3. Since the output is 1, the function executed successfully without raising an exception

The function takes two parameters:
- `data`: This is passed to `writer.writerows(data)`, which expects an iterable of rows (each row being an iterable of values)
- `file_name`: This is the path/name of the file to write to

Since the function returned 1 (success), we know:
- The file was successfully opened and written
- No exception was raised
- The file_name must be a valid path that the system can write to
- The data must be in a format that `writerows()` can process

Any valid CSV data structure would work. For example:
- A list of lists: `[["col1", "col2"], ["val1", "val2"]]`
- Any iterable of iterables

Since we just need the function to return 1 (success), we need:
- A valid file_name (string representing a writable file path)
- Valid data that can be processed by csv.writer.writerows()

Let me use simple, valid inputs:
- `data`: `[["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]` (a list of rows)
- `file_name`: `"output.csv"` (a valid filename)

These inputs would cause the function to execute successfully and return 1.
