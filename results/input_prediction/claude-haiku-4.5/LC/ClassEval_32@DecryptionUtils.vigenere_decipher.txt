[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output "AbCdEfG" to find the input ciphertext and key.

The Vigenere decipher works by:
1. For each alphabetic character in ciphertext, it subtracts the shift (derived from the key)
2. The shift is calculated as: ord(key_char.lower()) - ord('a')
3. For each letter: decrypted_char = chr((ord(char.lower()) - ord('a') - shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
4. Case is preserved from the original ciphertext

Output is "AbCdEfG", so we need to find what ciphertext + key would produce this.

Let me denote:
- Output: A, b, C, d, E, f, G (uppercase/lowercase pattern preserved)
- Key cycles through its characters

For a simple case, let's try key = "a" (shift = 0):
- If key is "a", shift = 0 for all characters
- Decryption doesn't change anything
- So ciphertext would need to be "AbCdEfG"

Let me verify:
- 'A' (upper): shift=0, (0-0)%26=0 → 'a' → 'A' ✓
- 'b' (lower): shift=0, (1-0)%26=1 → 'b' ✓
- 'C' (upper): shift=0, (2-0)%26=2 → 'c' → 'C' ✓
- 'd' (lower): shift=0, (3-0)%26=3 → 'd' ✓
- 'E' (upper): shift=0, (4-0)%26=4 → 'e' → 'E' ✓
- 'f' (lower): shift=0, (5-0)%26=5 → 'f' ✓
- 'G' (upper): shift=0, (6-0)%26=6 → 'g' → 'G' ✓

This works! With key="a" and ciphertext="AbCdEfG", the output is "AbCdEfG".

Alternatively, any key where all characters decrypt to 0 shift would work, but "a" is the simplest.
