[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `__pow__` method step by step:

1. The method signature is `def __pow__(self, n):`
2. It first checks `if isinstance(n, Permutation)` - if true, raises NotImplementedError
3. Then it does `n = int(n)` - converting n to an integer
4. Finally returns `self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`

Looking at the output, we have:
- `_array_form`: null
- `_size`: 7

The output shows the result after `__pow__` executes. Since `__pow__` returns `self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`, and the output shows a Permutation object with `_array_form: null` and `_size: 7`, this tells us about the resulting Permutation.

For the input:
- `self` should be a Permutation object. We need to provide initial values for `_array_form`, `_size`, and `_cyclic_form`
- `n` is the exponent - it could be any value that can be converted to int

Since the output shows `_size: 7`, and this is likely preserved from the original permutation or set by the result, the original permutation could have had `_size: 7`.

The `_array_form` is null in the output, which could mean:
1. The result hasn't computed the array form yet
2. Or it's intentionally null

For `_cyclic_form`, it's not shown in the output but appears in the structure - it could be None or any value.

Since we need to determine what input would produce this output, and the method calls `_af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`:
- `n` must be convertible to an integer using `int(n)`
- The simplest case would be if `n` is already an integer

Let me assume:
- `self._array_form`: could be anything (let's say null initially)
- `self._size`: 7 (preserved in output)
- `self._cyclic_form`: null or some value
- `n`: any integer like 1, 2, or 0 (a simple integer to power a permutation)

The most logical input would be:
- `n`: 1 (identity for exponentiation)
- `self._size`: 7
- `self._array_form`: null or some array
- `self._cyclic_form`: null
