<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution to understand what input would produce the output "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)".

The function `sstr(expr, **settings)` creates a `StrPrinter` and calls `doprint(expr)`, which calls `_print(expr)`.

Looking at the output "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)", this format comes from the `_print_Permutation` method in the StrPrinter class.

Let me examine the `_print_Permutation` method:
```python
def _print_Permutation(self, expr):
    from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation, Cycle
    if Permutation.print_cyclic:
        # ... cyclic printing logic ...
    else:
        s = expr.support()
        if not s:
            if expr.size < 5:
                return 'Permutation(%s)' % str(expr.array_form)
            return 'Permutation([], size=%s)' % expr.size
        trim = str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) + ', size=%s' % expr.size
        use = full = str(expr.array_form)
        if len(trim) < len(full):
            use = trim
        return 'Permutation(%s)' % use
```

The output is "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)", which matches the format `'Permutation(%s)' % use` where `use = trim`.

For this to happen:
- `Permutation.print_cyclic` must be False (which is the default)
- `s = expr.support()` must return a non-empty list (otherwise it would use different format)
- `len(trim) < len(full)` must be True to use the trim version

The output shows `[1, 0]`, which is `expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]`.

For the output "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)":
- `expr.array_form` must be `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` or similar (with positions 0 and 1 swapped, then identity for rest)
- `expr.size` must be 6
- The support needs to have its last element at index 1 (so `s[-1] + 1 = 2`)
- `[1, 0]` is `array_form[:2]`

The `support()` method returns indices where `a[i] != i`. For `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, support would be `[0, 1]` since positions 0 and 1 don't map to themselves.

So:
- `_array_form` = `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (a transposition of elements 0 and 1)
- `_size` = 6

The kwargs don't affect the output format since they're just settings for the printer, and the default is used if not specified. I can set it to an empty dict or None.
