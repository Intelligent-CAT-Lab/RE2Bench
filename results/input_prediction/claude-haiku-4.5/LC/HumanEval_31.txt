[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand when it returns True.

The function `is_prime(n)` returns:
- False if n < 2
- False if any k in range(2, n-1) divides n evenly
- True if none of the above conditions are met

For the output to be True:
1. n must be >= 2 (otherwise first condition returns False)
2. For all k in range(2, n-1), n % k must not equal 0

Let me think about which values would return True:
- n = 2: range(2, 1) is empty, so the loop doesn't execute, returns True ✓
- n = 3: range(2, 2) is empty, so the loop doesn't execute, returns True ✓
- n = 4: range(2, 3) = [2], and 4 % 2 == 0, returns False ✗
- n = 5: range(2, 4) = [2, 3], 5 % 2 = 1 (not 0), 5 % 3 = 2 (not 0), returns True ✓

So any prime number (or numbers where the range is empty) would return True. The simplest cases are n = 2 or n = 3, or any actual prime number like 5, 7, 11, etc.

I'll use n = 2 as the simplest valid input that returns True.
