[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce the output "db0db".

The function `decimal_to_binary(decimal)` works as follows:
1. It calls `bin(decimal)` which converts a decimal number to binary representation
2. It takes `[2:]` to remove the '0b' prefix that Python's `bin()` adds
3. It wraps the result with 'db' on both sides

Given output: "db0db"

Working backwards:
- The output is "db0db"
- After removing the 'db' prefix and suffix: "0"
- This "0" came from `bin(decimal)[2:]`
- So `bin(decimal)` must have been "0b0"
- `bin(0)` returns "0b0"
- Therefore, `decimal = 0`

Let me verify: `decimal_to_binary(0)` → `'db' + bin(0)[2:] + 'db'` → `'db' + '0b0'[2:] + 'db'` → `'db' + '0' + 'db'` → `'db0db'` ✓
