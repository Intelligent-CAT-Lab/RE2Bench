[THOUGHT]
The function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` checks if three numbers form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It returns `True` if any of these conditions hold:
1. `a * a == b * b + c * c` (a is the hypotenuse)
2. `b * b == a * a + c * c` (b is the hypotenuse)
3. `c * c == a * a + b * b` (c is the hypotenuse)

Since the output is `true`, at least one of these conditions must be satisfied.

The simplest case would be to use a well-known Pythagorean triple. For example:
- a=3, b=4, c=5: Check if `3*3 == 4*4 + 5*5` → `9 == 16 + 25` → `9 == 41` → False
                 Check if `4*4 == 3*3 + 5*5` → `16 == 9 + 25` → `16 == 34` → False
                 Check if `5*5 == 3*3 + 4*4` → `25 == 9 + 16` → `25 == 25` → True ✓

So a=3, b=4, c=5 would work, with c being the hypotenuse.

Let me verify: `3*3 == 4*4 + 5*5` is False, `4*4 == 3*3 + 5*5` is False, `5*5 == 3*3 + 4*4` is `25 == 25` which is True.

So the function returns `True`.
