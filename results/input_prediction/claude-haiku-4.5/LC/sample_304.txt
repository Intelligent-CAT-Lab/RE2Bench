Let me trace through the function execution step by step.

The function:
1. Sorts dictionary items by key in reverse order and extracts the first key-value pair
2. Removes that pair from the dictionary
3. Sorts the remaining items by key in reverse order and extracts the first key-value pair
4. Removes that pair from the dictionary
5. Returns a new dictionary with these two key-value pairs

Given the output: `{"87": 7, "18": 6}`

This means:
- `key1: val1` = `"87": 7` (the largest key in the original dictionary)
- `key2: val2` = `"18": 6` (the largest key in the remaining dictionary after removing "87")

Working backwards:
- The largest key in the original dictionary must be "87"
- After removing "87", the largest key in what remains must be "18"
- The remaining keys in the structure are: "2", "17", "16"

For "18" to be the largest key after removing "87", the original dictionary must have had "87" as the maximum, and "18" as the second maximum.

Comparing the keys lexicographically (as strings):
- "87" > "18" > "17" > "16" > "2"

So the original dictionary should have contained:
- "87": 7
- "18": 6
- And three other keys from {2, 17, 16} with some values

The values for "2", "17", and "16" can be any values since they won't be extracted. Let me assign them arbitrary values like 1, 2, 3.
