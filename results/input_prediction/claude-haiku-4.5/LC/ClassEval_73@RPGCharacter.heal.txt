[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `heal` method:

```python
def heal(self):
    self.hp += 10
    if self.hp > 100:
        self.hp = 100
    return self.hp
```

The method:
1. Adds 10 to current hp
2. Caps hp at 100 if it exceeds 100
3. Returns the final hp value

Given that the output is 100, I need to work backwards:
- The return value is 100
- This means after adding 10 and capping, hp = 100
- So either:
  - hp was already at 100 before healing (100 + 10 = 110 → capped to 100)
  - hp was 90 before healing (90 + 10 = 100, no cap needed)
  - hp was any value from 91-100 before healing (would result in 100 after the cap)

However, the most straightforward interpretation is that hp was at least 90 (so that 90 + 10 = 100). But it could be higher and still get capped to 100.

The simplest case would be hp = 90 or any value where hp + 10 >= 100 results in exactly 100 after healing.

Let me go with hp = 90 as the most logical input, since 90 + 10 = 100, and the return is exactly 100 without needing the cap logic.

Actually, let me reconsider: if hp = 91, then 91 + 10 = 101, which gets capped to 100. If hp = 90, then 90 + 10 = 100, which doesn't need capping.

For the other attributes (name, attack_power, defense, level, exp), they're not used in the heal method, so they can be any reasonable default values for an RPG character. Based on the `__init__` method:
- name: can be any string
- attack_power: can be any number
- defense: can be any number
- level: defaults to 1
- exp: defaults to 0

I'll use reasonable RPG defaults.
