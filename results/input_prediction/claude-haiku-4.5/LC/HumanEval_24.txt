[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `largest_divisor`:

The function takes an integer `n` and iterates through all numbers from `n-1` down to 0 (in reversed range). It returns the first number `i` that divides `n` evenly (where `n % i == 0`).

Given that the output is `1`, this means the function returned `1`.

The function will return `1` when:
- It iterates through `range(n)` in reverse (from n-1 down to 0)
- The first divisor it finds is `1`

Since `1` divides every integer evenly, `1` will always be found as a divisor. The function will return `1` only when no other divisor is found before reaching `1`.

However, looking at the loop: `for i in reversed(range(n)):`
- `range(n)` produces [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
- `reversed(range(n))` produces [n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0]

Wait, let me reconsider. The loop goes from n-1 down to 0. But we need to check what values actually get checked:
- If n = 2: reversed(range(2)) = [1, 0]. Check i=1: 2%1=0, returns 1. ✓
- If n = 3: reversed(range(3)) = [2, 1, 0]. Check i=2: 3%2=1 (not divisor), Check i=1: 3%1=0, returns 1. ✓

Actually, for any n > 1, the function will eventually return 1 because 1 always divides n.

But wait - what if n = 0 or n = 1?
- If n = 0: range(0) = [], reversed([]) = [], the loop doesn't execute, and there's no explicit return, so it returns None. But output is 1, not None.
- If n = 1: range(1) = [0], reversed([0]) = [0]. Check i=0: 1%0 would cause a ZeroDivisionError!

So n cannot be 0 or 1. For any n ≥ 2, the function will return 1 (the largest divisor less than n itself).

Since the output is 1, and 1 is the largest proper divisor of any number, any n ≥ 2 would work. The simplest case would be n = 2, which gives the first divisor found (checking from n-1=1 downward, finds 1 immediately).

Let me verify with n = 2:
- range(2) = [0, 1]
- reversed(range(2)) = [1, 0]
- Loop iteration 1: i = 1, check 2 % 1 == 0? Yes! Return 1. ✓

This matches the output. Any n ≥ 2 would produce output 1, but the minimal case is n = 2.
