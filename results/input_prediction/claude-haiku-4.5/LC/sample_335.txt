[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what happens:

1. `new_text = list(text)` - converts text string to a list of characters
2. `if to_remove in new_text:` - checks if to_remove character exists in the list
3. If it exists:
   - `index = new_text.index(to_remove)` - finds the first occurrence index
   - `new_text.remove(to_remove)` - removes the first occurrence of to_remove
   - `new_text.insert(index, '?')` - inserts '?' at the original index
   - `new_text.remove('?')` - removes the '?' that was just inserted
4. `return ''.join(new_text)` - joins the list back into a string

So the net effect is:
- If `to_remove` is in `new_text`: the character gets removed, then '?' is inserted and removed, so the character is simply removed from the text
- If `to_remove` is NOT in `new_text`: nothing happens, text remains unchanged

Given output is "sjbrfqmw"

Since the output is "sjbrfqmw", we need to determine what the input was.

Case 1: `to_remove` is NOT in the text
- Then `text` would just be returned as-is: "sjbrfqmw"
- So `text = "sjbrfqmw"` and `to_remove` could be any character not in "sjbrfqmw"

Case 2: `to_remove` IS in the text
- Then one occurrence of `to_remove` would be removed from `text`
- So if output is "sjbrfqmw", the input text would have been "sjbrfqmw" with one extra occurrence of `to_remove` character inserted somewhere

The simplest solution is Case 1: The `to_remove` character is not in the text at all, so the text passes through unchanged.

For example:
- `text = "sjbrfqmw"`
- `to_remove = "a"` (or any character not in the text)

Or we could have Case 2 where a character was removed. For instance:
- `text = "sjbrfaqmw"` (with 'a' inserted)
- `to_remove = "a"`
This would remove the 'a' and result in "sjbrfqmw"

The most straightforward interpretation is Case 1 where to_remove is simply not found in the text.
