[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of function `f`:

1. The function takes a dictionary `d` as input
2. It creates a shallow copy: `d = d.copy()`
3. It removes one item from the copy using `popitem()` - this removes an arbitrary item (in Python 3.7+, it removes the last inserted item)
4. It returns the modified copy

Given the output is `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`, this means after copying and removing one item, we have two key-value pairs left.

So the original input dictionary `d` must have had 3 items (since `popitem()` removes exactly one item).

The output shows `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`, which means these two items survived the `popitem()` operation. Therefore, the third item that was removed must have been the one at key "x".

Looking at the structure provided, it has three keys: "l", "t", and "x". The values for "l" and "t" in the output are 1 and 2 respectively.

For the input, "l" should be 1, "t" should be 2, and "x" should have some value that gets removed. Since we don't have information about what value "x" had, I can use any reasonable value. Let me use a simple value like 3.

Actually, the problem is asking what values should replace the XXX placeholders. Looking at the structure:
- "l": XXX should be 1 (since it appears in output with value 1)
- "t": XXX should be 2 (since it appears in output with value 2)
- "x": XXX should be any value (let's say 3, since it gets popped out and we don't care about it)
