[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. `input()` reads a string from input
2. `ord(input())` converts the first character of that string to its ASCII/Unicode integer value
3. `ord(input()) + 1` adds 1 to that value
4. `chr(...)` converts the resulting integer back to a character
5. `print(...)` outputs that character

The output is "b".

Working backwards:
- `chr(?)` produced "b"
- "b" has ASCII value 98
- So `ord(input()) + 1 = 98`
- Therefore `ord(input()) = 97`
- The character with ASCII value 97 is "a"
- So `input()` must have returned "a" (or a string starting with "a")

Since `ord()` takes the first character of a string, the input needs to be a string where the first character is "a".
