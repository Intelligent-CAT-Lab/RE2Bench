[THOUGHT]
The function `add` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum.

Given that the output is 1223, I need to find two integers x and y such that x + y = 1223.

There are multiple possible combinations, but a simple and reasonable one would be:
- x = 1000, y = 223 (1000 + 223 = 1223)
- x = 611, y = 612 (611 + 612 = 1223)
- x = 1223, y = 0 (1223 + 0 = 1223)
- x = 0, y = 1223 (0 + 1223 = 1223)

Without additional constraints, I'll use a straightforward split: x = 1000 and y = 223, which gives 1223 as the output.
