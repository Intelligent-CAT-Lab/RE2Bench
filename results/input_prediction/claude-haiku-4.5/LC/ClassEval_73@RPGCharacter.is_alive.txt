[THOUGHT]
The `is_alive` method checks if `self.hp > 0` and returns a boolean.

Given output: `true`

This means `self.hp > 0` must be True, so `self.hp` must be any positive number.

The method doesn't use `args` or `kwargs`, and those are empty in the structure.

For the `self` object, I need to provide values for all attributes that would be set by `__init__`:
- `name`: can be any string, let's use "Warrior"
- `hp`: must be > 0 for output to be true, let's use 100
- `attack_power`: can be any positive number, let's use 15
- `defense`: can be any positive number, let's use 10
- `level`: default is 1, can use any positive integer, let's use 1
- `exp`: initialized to 0

The key constraint is that `hp > 0` must evaluate to `true`. Any positive hp value will work.
