[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `__eq__` method to determine what inputs would produce `output: true`.

The `__eq__` method has the following logic:
1. If `other` is not an instance of `Model`, return `NotImplemented`
2. If `self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model`, return `False`
3. Get `my_pk = self.pk`
4. If `my_pk is None`, return `self is other` (identity comparison)
5. Otherwise, return `my_pk == other.pk`

For the output to be `true`, we need one of these conditions:
- `my_pk is None` and `self is other` (same object)
- `my_pk is not None` and `my_pk == other.pk`

Since the structure shows two different object instances (they have separate `_state` dictionaries), they are not the same object (`self is other` would be `False`). Therefore, we need `my_pk is not None` and `my_pk == other.pk`.

The `pk` property calls `_get_pk_val()` which returns `getattr(self, meta.pk.attname)`. For a Django model, the primary key is typically the `id` field.

To get `output: true`, I need:
- Both objects to be instances of the same Model class (so `concrete_model` comparison passes)
- Both objects to have the same `id` (primary key) value
- The `id` should not be `None`

Let me set:
- `self.id = 1` (or any non-None value)
- `other.id = 1` (same value)
- Both have `_state` indicating they are from the database (not new objects being added)

For `_state`:
- `db`: Should be the database alias, typically `'default'`
- `adding`: Should be `False` to indicate these are existing objects from the database
