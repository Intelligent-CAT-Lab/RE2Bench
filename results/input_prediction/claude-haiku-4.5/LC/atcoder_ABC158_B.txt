Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The output is `0`, which means `ans` after all operations equals `0`.

Let's trace through the code:
1. `N, A, B = map(int, input().split())` - reads three integers
2. `ans = N // (A + B) * A` - integer division of N by (A+B), then multiply by A
3. `rem = N % (A + B)` - remainder of N divided by (A+B)
4. `ans += min(rem, A)` - add the minimum of remainder and A to ans
5. `print(ans)` - prints the result, which is 0

For `ans` to be 0 at the end:
- `N // (A + B) * A + min(N % (A + B), A) = 0`

The simplest case is when all three values are 0, but that would cause division by zero or issues.

Let me try: if `N = 0`:
- `ans = 0 // (A + B) * A = 0 * A = 0`
- `rem = 0 % (A + B) = 0`
- `ans += min(0, A) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Output: `0` ✓

This works! We need `N = 0` and any positive values for A and B (to avoid division issues).

Let me verify with `N = 0, A = 1, B = 1`:
- `ans = 0 // 2 * 1 = 0 * 1 = 0`
- `rem = 0 % 2 = 0`
- `ans += min(0, 1) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Output: `0` ✓

Another simple solution: `N = 0, A = 1, B = 2`:
- `ans = 0 // 3 * 1 = 0`
- `rem = 0 % 3 = 0`
- `ans += min(0, 1) = 0`
- Output: `0` ✓

Any input with `N = 0` and positive A and B will work. The simplest is `0 1 1`.
