[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step.

The code reads an integer N, then checks if N is even or odd:
- If N is even (N % 2 == 0), it prints 0.5
- If N is odd, it prints (N + 1) / N / 2

The output is 0.5050505050505051, which is NOT 0.5, so N must be odd.

For odd N, the formula is: (N + 1) / N / 2

Let me work backwards from the output:
(N + 1) / N / 2 = 0.5050505050505051

This can be rewritten as:
(N + 1) / (N * 2) = 0.5050505050505051
(N + 1) / (2N) = 0.5050505050505051

Solving for N:
N + 1 = 0.5050505050505051 * 2N
N + 1 = 1.010101010101010 * N
N + 1 = 1.010101010101010 * N
1 = 1.010101010101010 * N - N
1 = N * (1.010101010101010 - 1)
1 = N * 0.010101010101010
N = 1 / 0.010101010101010
N ≈ 99

Let me verify: 0.010101010101010 = 1/99 (repeating)
So N = 99

Checking: (99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = (100/99) / 2 = 100 / 198 = 50/99 ≈ 0.5050505050505051 ✓

Also verify that 99 is odd: 99 % 2 = 1 (not 0), so it's odd ✓
