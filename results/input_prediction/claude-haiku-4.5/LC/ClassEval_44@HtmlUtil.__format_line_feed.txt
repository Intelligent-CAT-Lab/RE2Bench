[THOUGHT]
The `__format_line_feed` method takes a `text` parameter and applies a regex substitution to it.

The regex pattern is `re.compile('\\n+')` which matches one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`).

The substitution replaces all sequences of one or more newlines with a single newline (`'\n'`).

Given the output is `"Some sentence here."`, which contains no newline characters, we need to determine what input would produce this output.

Since the output contains no newlines, the input could be:
1. The same text with no newlines: `"Some sentence here."`
2. The same text with one or more newlines anywhere: Since the regex replaces `\n+` with `\n`, if there were any newlines in the input, they would be replaced with a single `\n`, resulting in output that contains at least one `\n`

Since the output has no newlines at all, the input must also have no newlines. The most straightforward answer is that the input text is exactly `"Some sentence here."` with no newline characters.

Alternatively, the input could have had newlines that were removed, but since the function only collapses multiple newlines into single ones (doesn't remove them entirely), the output having no newlines means the input had no newlines either.

Therefore, the input `text` parameter should be `"Some sentence here."`
