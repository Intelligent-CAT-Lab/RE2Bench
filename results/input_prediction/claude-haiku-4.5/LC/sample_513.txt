[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine what input would produce an empty list `[]`.

The function has three while loops:
1. `while -1 in array: array.pop(-3)` - removes element at index -3 (third from end)
2. `while 0 in array: array.pop()` - removes last element
3. `while 1 in array: array.pop(0)` - removes first element

For the output to be `[]`, the array must be empty after all three loops complete.

Let me think about what inputs could work:
- If the input array is already `[]`, all three while loops would not execute (since -1, 0, and 1 won't be in an empty array), and it would return `[]`. ✓

Let me verify this is the simplest case:
- `while -1 in array:` - checks if -1 is in array. If array is [], -1 is not in it, loop doesn't run.
- `while 0 in array:` - checks if 0 is in array. If array is [], 0 is not in it, loop doesn't run.
- `while 1 in array:` - checks if 1 is in array. If array is [], 1 is not in it, loop doesn't run.
- Returns `[]` ✓

So the input could be `[]`.

However, let me also consider if there could be other inputs that result in an empty array. For instance, if the array only contained -1, 0, and/or 1 values, they would all be removed:
- An array like `[-1]` would have -1 removed at index -3, but index -3 on a single-element array would wrap around. Actually, `pop(-3)` on `[-1]` would fail or behave unexpectedly. Let me reconsider.
- An array like `[0]` would be emptied by the second loop (pop removes the last element).
- An array like `[1]` would be emptied by the third loop (pop(0) removes the first element).

The simplest and most straightforward input that produces `[]` is simply `[]`.
