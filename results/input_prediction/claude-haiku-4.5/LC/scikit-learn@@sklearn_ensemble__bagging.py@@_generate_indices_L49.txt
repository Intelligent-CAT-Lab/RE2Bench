[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `_generate_indices` to understand what inputs would produce the output `[0]`.

The function has two branches:
1. If `bootstrap` is True: `indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)`
2. If `bootstrap` is False: `indices = sample_without_replacement(n_population, n_samples, random_state=random_state)`

The output is `[0]`, which is an array with a single element 0.

Let me consider both cases:

**Case 1: bootstrap = True**
- `random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)` should return `[0]`
- This means we need `n_samples = 1` (to get array of length 1)
- The randint call generates integers in range [0, n_population), so to get [0], we need `n_population > 0`
- The simplest would be `n_population = 1` (generates 0) or larger
- With `random_state` properly seeded to produce 0 as first random integer

**Case 2: bootstrap = False**
- `sample_without_replacement(n_population, n_samples, random_state=random_state)` should return `[0]`
- For sampling without replacement to return [0], we need `n_samples = 1` and `n_population >= 1`
- The function samples `n_samples` unique indices from range [0, n_population)
- To get [0], we're sampling 1 element from a population of at least 1, and that element is 0

Let me go with Case 1 (bootstrap = True) as it's simpler:
- `bootstrap = True`
- `n_samples = 1` (to get output of length 1)
- `n_population = 1` or larger (needs to be > 0)
- `random_state` needs to be seeded such that `randint(0, n_population, 1)` returns `[0]`

Actually, let me reconsider. With `randint(0, n_population, 1)`:
- If `n_population = 1`, it generates from [0, 1), so only 0 is possible → returns [0] ✓
- `random_state` can be any valid random state (e.g., seed=42, or any integer seed)

For simplicity, I'll use:
- `random_state = 42` (or any seed that works)
- `bootstrap = True`
- `n_population = 1`
- `n_samples = 1`

This should work because `randint(0, 1, 1)` can only produce [0].
