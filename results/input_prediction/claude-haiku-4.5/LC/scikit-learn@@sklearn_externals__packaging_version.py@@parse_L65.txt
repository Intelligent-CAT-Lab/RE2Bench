1. The output shows `<Version('1.11.3')>`, which is the string representation of a Version object created with version string "1.11.3".

2. The `parse` function tries to create a `Version` object first with the input version string. If that succeeds (no InvalidVersion exception), it returns that Version object.

3. Since the output is a Version object (not a LegacyVersion), the `Version(version)` call must have succeeded without raising InvalidVersion.

4. The Version.__init__ method parses the version string using a regex pattern. For the output to be `<Version('1.11.3')>`, the version string must be "1.11.3" (or something that parses to version 1.11.3).

5. Looking at the Version.__init__ code, it extracts:
   - epoch: defaults to 0 if not present
   - release: tuple of integers from the release part (1, 11, 3)
   - pre, post, dev, local: all parsed from their respective groups

6. The string "1.11.3" is a valid semantic version format that would match the regex and create a Version object with release=(1, 11, 3).

7. Therefore, the input version string to the `parse` function should be "1.11.3".
