Let me trace through the `select` method to work backwards from the output.

The output is: `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`

Breaking down the SQL generation logic:
1. `if fields is None: fields = '*'` - Since the output shows `SELECT *`, this means `fields` was `None` (default)
2. `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'` - This gives us `SELECT * FROM table1`, so `self.table_name = 'table1'`
3. `if condition is not None: sql += f' WHERE {condition}'` - The output has `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20`, so `condition = 'age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`
4. Finally `return sql + ';'` adds the semicolon

So the function was called with:
- `self.table_name = 'table1'`
- `fields = None` (default parameter, not provided)
- `condition = 'age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`

Since the structure shows `args: {}` and the method signature is `select(self, fields=None, condition=None)`, both optional parameters must have been passed as kwargs (or left as defaults). Given the structure shows only `condition` in kwargs, `fields` was either not provided or was None by default.
