[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `ridge_regression` function and the output to determine what inputs would produce that output.

1. The output is a numpy array with 5 elements: `[-0.22704354  0.14145671 -0.1168167  -1.4226984  -0.87262106]`

2. This is a coefficient vector returned from ridge regression. The length of 5 suggests that the input X has 5 features (or possibly 4 features + 1 intercept if return_intercept=True).

3. The function `ridge_regression` calls `_ridge_regression` with the provided parameters. Without seeing `_ridge_regression`, I need to infer typical ridge regression inputs:
   - X: input features (matrix)
   - y: target values
   - alpha: regularization parameter
   - Other parameters have reasonable defaults

4. For a ridge regression that produces 5 coefficients:
   - X should have shape (n_samples, 5) or (n_samples, 4) depending on whether intercept is included
   - y should have shape (n_samples,)
   - alpha should be a positive float (default often 1.0)
   - solver defaults to 'auto'
   - return_n_iter defaults to False
   - return_intercept defaults to False

5. Since we're getting exactly 5 coefficients and return_intercept is likely False (default), X probably has 5 features.

6. For reasonable ridge regression:
   - alpha could be 1.0 (common default)
   - solver = 'auto' (default)
   - tol = 0.001 (default)
   - random_state = None (default)
   - max_iter = None (default)
   - sample_weight = None (default)
   - return_n_iter = False (default)
   - return_intercept = False (default)

7. X and y need to be compatible arrays. A minimal example would be something like random data with 5 features.

Since the actual X and y values aren't specified in the output, I'll create plausible synthetic data that would generate approximately this output. The specific values suggest some actual data was used, but without more information, I'll use reasonable arrays.

Let me construct inputs that would be typical:
- X: A 2D array with multiple samples and 5 features
- y: A 1D array of target values
- alpha: 1.0 (typical default for ridge)
- Other parameters: use defaults

For reproducibility with the given output, I'll use generic placeholders that represent the data structure.
