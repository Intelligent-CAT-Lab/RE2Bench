[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce output `2`.

1. The function `next_smallest(lst)` takes a list as input
2. It converts the list to a set (removing duplicates) and then sorts it: `lst = sorted(set(lst))`
3. It returns `None` if the sorted list has fewer than 2 elements
4. Otherwise, it returns `lst[1]` (the second element of the sorted list)

Since the output is `2` (not `None`), we know:
- The sorted unique list must have at least 2 elements
- The second element (`lst[1]`) must be `2`

So after `sorted(set(lst))`, we need a list where the second element is `2`.

This means the first (smallest) element must be less than 2, and the second element must be 2.

The simplest case would be: `sorted(set(lst)) = [1, 2]` or could be `[0, 2]`, `[-1, 2]`, etc.

For `sorted(set(lst)) = [1, 2]`, the original list could be:
- `[1, 2]`
- `[2, 1]`
- `[1, 1, 2]`
- `[1, 2, 2]`
- `[2, 1, 1, 2]`
- Or any permutation/duplication of 1 and 2

The most straightforward input would be `[1, 2]`.

Let me verify:
- `lst = [1, 2]`
- `set(lst) = {1, 2}`
- `sorted(set(lst)) = [1, 2]`
- `len([1, 2]) = 2`, which is not `< 2`
- Return `[1, 2][1] = 2` ✓

This matches the expected output.
