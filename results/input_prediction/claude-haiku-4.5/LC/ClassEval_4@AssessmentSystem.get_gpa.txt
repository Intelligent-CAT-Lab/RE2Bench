[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `get_gpa` method to understand what input would produce an output of 75.0.

The method:
1. Checks if `name` is in `self.students` and if that student has courses
2. If true, calculates GPA as: sum of all course grades / number of courses
3. Returns None otherwise

Given output is 75.0, this means:
- The name must be in students
- The student must have courses
- sum(courses.values()) / len(courses) = 75.0

So: sum of grades / number of courses = 75.0

Looking at the structure, I need to determine which student is being queried and what their course grades are.

Let me work backwards from 75.0:
- If we have 2 courses with average 75.0: sum = 150, so two grades that average to 75
- If we have 1 course: grade = 75.0
- If we have 3 courses: sum = 225
- If we have 4 courses: sum = 300

The structure shows:
- Alice has 2 courses (Mathematics, Science)
- Bob has 1 course (Physics)
- Charlie has 2 courses (Chemistry, Physics)

For the output to be 75.0:
- If Alice: sum of 2 courses = 150, so Mathematics + Science = 150 (could be 75+75, 70+80, etc.)
- If Bob: Physics grade = 75.0
- If Charlie: sum of 2 courses = 150

The simplest solution is Bob with Physics = 75.0, or any configuration where the average equals 75.0.

Let me go with:
- Alice: Mathematics = 80, Science = 70 (average = 75)
- Bob: Physics = 75
- Charlie: Chemistry = 80, Physics = 70 (average = 75)
- Query name = "Alice" (or any of them would work, but I'll choose Alice)

Actually, the most straightforward is to have the query be for Alice with grades that average to 75.0, like Mathematics = 75 and Science = 75, or Mathematics = 80 and Science = 70.

Let me use simple values: Alice with Math=80, Science=70, average=75, and name="Alice".
For the other fields not explicitly in courses dict, I'll fill with reasonable placeholder values.
