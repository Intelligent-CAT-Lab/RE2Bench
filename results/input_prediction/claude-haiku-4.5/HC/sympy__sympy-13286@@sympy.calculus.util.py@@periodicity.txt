[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `periodicity` function to understand what input would produce an output of `2*pi`.

Looking at the function:
1. It takes `f`, `symbol`, and `check` as parameters
2. It simplifies `f`
3. It checks if the function is periodic

The function returns `period` if it finds one. For the output to be `2*pi`, we need to trace backwards.

Key paths that could return a period:
1. If `f` is a `TrigonometricFunction`, it calls `f.period(symbol)`
2. For `sin` and `cos`, the period is `2*pi`
3. For `tan` and `cot`, the period is `pi`

Since the output is `2*pi`, the input function must be a sine or cosine function.

Let me check: if `f = sin(symbol)` where `symbol` is some variable like `x`:
- `f.period(symbol)` would call `TrigonometricFunction._period(2 * pi, symbol)`
- For `sin(x)`, this returns `2*pi`

So if we call `periodicity(sin(x), x)`, we should get `2*pi`.

Since `symbol` is not provided in the output, I need to infer it. A common choice would be to use a symbol like `x`.

Let me verify: 
- `f = sin(x)` where `x` is a symbol
- `symbol = x` (or None, which would be inferred from `f.free_symbols`)
- The function would detect `f` is a `TrigonometricFunction`
- Call `f.period(symbol)` which returns `2*pi` for sine with period `2*pi`
- Return `2*pi`

This matches the expected output.

So the input would be:
- `f`: a sine or cosine function of some symbol, e.g., `sin(x)` where `x` is a Symbol
- `symbol`: the variable with respect to which we find the period, e.g., `x`
- `check`: `False` (the default)

The simplest example would be `sin(x)` with `symbol=x`.

Actually, looking more carefully at the structure, it seems like we need to provide:
- `f`: the function (e.g., `sin(x)`)
- `symbol`: the symbol (e.g., `x`)
- `check`: a boolean (default is `False`)

Since the kwargs are not specified and check defaults to False, I should use `sin(x)` as `f` and `x` as the symbol.
