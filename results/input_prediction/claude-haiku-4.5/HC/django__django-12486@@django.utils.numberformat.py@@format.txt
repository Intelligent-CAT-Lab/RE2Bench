[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output to determine the input to the `format` function.

The output is a very large negative integer: "-359538626972463141629054847463408713596141135051689993197834953606314521560057077521179117265533756343080917907028764928468642653778928365536935093407075033972099821153102564152490980180778657888151737016910267884609166473806445896331617118664246696549595652408289446337476354361838599762500808052368249716736"

Let me trace through the code:

1. The function starts with various checks on `use_grouping`. Since no `use_l10n`, `grouping`, `thousand_sep`, or `force_grouping` are specified in kwargs, they have default values.

2. The key check is: `if isinstance(number, int) and (not use_grouping) and (not decimal_pos):`
   - If the number is an int, use_grouping is False, and decimal_pos is None, it returns `mark_safe(number)`.
   - However, the output is a string representation of the number, not a SafeString directly from mark_safe.

3. Looking at the output - it's a very large number that looks like it could be a Decimal converted to string in scientific notation, then processed.

4. Let me check if this could be from the scientific notation path:
   - If we have a float in scientific notation or a Decimal with large exponent, it goes through the `'{:e}'.format(number)` path
   - This splits on 'e' and recursively calls format on the coefficient
   
5. The output doesn't contain 'e', so it's not in scientific notation format at the end.

6. Given the massive size of this number and that it's negative, this is likely a very large Decimal that wasn't in scientific notation initially.

7. Since the output is just the number as a string (with a sign), the simplest path would be:
   - `number` is a negative Decimal (very large)
   - No decimal_pos specified (None by default)
   - No grouping applied
   - Result: sign + int_part + dec_part where dec_part is empty

8. The number itself is: -359538626972463141629054847463408713596141135051689993197834953606314521560057077521179117265533756343080917907028764928468642653778928365536935093407075033972099821153102564152490980180778657888151737016910267884609166473806445896331617118664246696549595652408289446337476354361838599762500808052368249716736

So the input would be:
- number: This large negative integer/Decimal
- decimal_sep: Some separator (likely '.' or ',')

Since mark_safe is applied but we get a string output, and the number is clearly passed through, I'll provide the number as a Decimal or int, and a reasonable decimal_sep like '.'.
