[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `_setup` and trace through the execution to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

From the output, I can see:
1. `values`: null
2. `norm`: null
3. `trans`: "log"
4. `_tick_params`: has all null values for locator, at, upto, count, every, between, minor
5. `_label_params`: has all null values for formatter and like, empty dict for base, null for unit
6. `_legend`: null
7. `_matplotlib_scale`: contains a transform object
8. `_pipeline`: null
9. `_spacer`: empty dict (this is suspicious - should be a function)

Looking at the code flow:
1. `new = copy(self)` - creates a copy
2. If `_tick_params` is None, calls `new.tick()` - but output shows _tick_params is not None, it's a dict with all None values
3. If `_label_params` is None, calls `new.label()` - but output shows _label_params is not None, it's a dict with null values
4. The function gets transform, scale, creates normalize function
5. Sets `_pipeline` but output shows it's null - this is odd unless an exception occurred
6. Sets `_spacer` to a function, but output shows empty dict

The fact that `_pipeline` is null suggests the function may not have completed normally, or the output is showing an intermediate/error state.

For the input `self`:
- `values`: should be null
- `norm`: should be null
- `trans`: should be "log"
- `_tick_params`: should be a dict (not None) with all None values
- `_label_params`: should be a dict (not None) with specific None/empty values

For the input `data` (Series):
- It needs to have a `name` property for `str(data.name)`
- It needs `min()`, `max()`, `dropna()`, `unique()` methods
- The name should be something meaningful

For the input `prop`:
- Needs `normed` attribute
- Needs `legend` attribute
- Needs `get_mapping()` method

Looking at the output more carefully, since `_pipeline` is null in the output but the code sets it, this suggests the function may have exited early or there's an error condition. However, based on the structure provided, I need to fill in reasonable values.

The input `self` should have the same structure as the output (before modifications).

For `data`, a minimal Series would work - it needs a name and numeric values.

For `prop`, it needs the required attributes and methods.
