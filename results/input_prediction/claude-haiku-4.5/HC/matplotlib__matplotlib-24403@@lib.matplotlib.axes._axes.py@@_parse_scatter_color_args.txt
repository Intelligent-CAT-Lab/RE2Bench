[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution to understand what inputs would produce this output.

The output is a tuple of three elements:
1. "#1f77b4" (a color string)
2. "[[0.12156863 0.46666667 0.70588235 1.        ]]" (a numpy array as string representation - this is the RGBA conversion of "#1f77b4")
3. "face" (a string)

These are returned as `(c, colors, edgecolors)`.

So:
- `c` = "#1f77b4"
- `colors` = numpy array [[0.12156863 0.46666667 0.70588235 1.        ]]
- `edgecolors` = "face"

Let me work backwards through the code:

1. The function starts by extracting facecolors, edgecolors, kwcolor, and c from various sources.
2. Since `edgecolors` is returned as "face", it must have been set to "face" somewhere.
3. Since `c` is "#1f77b4" and `colors` is its RGBA conversion, the code must have gone through the `c_is_mapped = False` path where `mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)` is called.

Looking at the logic:
- `c` must not be None initially
- `kwcolor` must be None (otherwise there would be an error or different behavior)
- `c_is_string_or_strings` would be True since c is a string
- Since it's a string, the condition `if not c_was_none and kwcolor is None and (not c_is_string_or_strings)` would be False, so we skip the numpy array conversion
- We'd go directly to trying `mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)` in the `if not c_is_mapped` block
- This succeeds and `colors` is set to the RGBA array

For `edgecolors` to be "face":
- It must be passed in as "face" initially, or set to "face" through the color handling logic
- Looking at the code, if `kwcolor` is not None and `edgecolors` is None, edgecolors is set to kwcolor
- But since `kwcolor` should be None (to avoid conflicts with c), edgecolors must come from kwargs or be passed directly
- Since it's returned as "face", it was likely passed in as "face"

For `xsize`:
- This is used to validate the size of c
- Since c is a single color string, xsize should be 1 (or any value that passes the validation)
- Actually, looking at the code more carefully, if colors has length 1 and xsize is 1, that would be valid
- Let me check: `if len(colors) not in (0, 1, xsize)` - this would raise an error if len(colors) is not 0, 1, or xsize
- Since colors has length 1, xsize can be 1 or any value (but 1 makes sense)

So the inputs should be:
- `c`: "#1f77b4"
- `edgecolors`: "face"
- `kwargs`: {} (empty dict, since all color-related params are popped)
- `xsize`: 1
- `get_next_color_func`: a function (but since c is not None, it won't be called)
