[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution to understand what input would produce an output of `{"score": -Infinity}`.

1. The `__call__` method creates a `scores` dictionary and iterates through `self._scorers`.

2. For each scorer in `self._scorers`, it tries to call either `scorer._score(...)` if it's a `_BaseScorer`, or `scorer(...)` otherwise.

3. The output shows `{"score": -Infinity}`, which means:
   - There is one scorer named "score" in `self._scorers`
   - The score computed for this scorer is `-Infinity`

4. Looking at the code flow:
   - If `_routing_enabled()` returns False (which is the default), it creates `routed_params` from common_kwargs
   - For each scorer, it calls either `scorer._score(cached_call, estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)` or `scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)`
   - The result is stored in `scores[name]`

5. To get `-Infinity` as output, the scorer must return `-Infinity`. This could happen if:
   - The scorer is not a `_BaseScorer` and simply returns `-Infinity` when called
   - Or a `_BaseScorer` that computes to `-Infinity`

6. The simplest approach: make the scorer a callable that returns `-Infinity` (not a `_BaseScorer`).

7. For the structure:
   - `self._scorers` should be `{"score": <callable_that_returns_negative_infinity>}`
   - `self._raise_exc` can be `True` or `False` (doesn't affect the output in this case since no exception is raised)
   - `estimator` can be any object
   - `args` should be empty or contain X and y_true values
   - `kwargs` is empty as shown

Let me construct the input:
- `_scorers`: `{"score": <a callable that returns -Infinity>}` - I'll represent this as a lambda or function
- `_raise_exc`: `True` (default behavior)
- `estimator`: any object (e.g., an empty dict or None)
- `args`: can be empty tuple `()` or contain some data
- `kwargs`: `{}` (as specified)

Since we need a callable that returns `-Infinity`, I'll use a lambda function or represent it abstractly. Given the output format, a simple callable that returns float('-inf') would work.

Actually, looking more carefully at the callable signatures - if scorer is not a `_BaseScorer`, it's called as `scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)`. So it receives the estimator and other args. A simple way to get `-Infinity` is to have a scorer that ignores its inputs and returns `-Infinity`.

For representation in JSON, I'll use a placeholder or describe it as a function object.
