[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `_route_params` method to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

The output is:
```
{
    "sample_weight": [1],
    "metadata": "a"
}
```

This is a `Bunch` object (which behaves like a dict) being returned from `_route_params`.

Looking at the code flow:
1. `_route_params` creates an empty `Bunch()` called `res`
2. It iterates through `self._requests.items()`
3. For each property and alias, it decides whether to add to `res`:
   - If `alias is False` or `alias == WARN`: skip
   - If `alias is True` and `prop in args`: add to `res`
   - If `alias is None` and `prop in args`: add to `unrequested`
   - If `alias in args`: add to `res`
4. If there are unrequested params, it raises `UnsetMetadataPassedError`
5. Otherwise, it returns `res`

Since the output shows `res` being returned with both "sample_weight" and "metadata", and no exception is raised, there must be no `unrequested` items.

The output has:
- `"sample_weight": [1]`
- `"metadata": "a"`

For both to appear in `res`:
1. For "sample_weight" to be in `res` with value `[1]`:
   - Either: `_requests["sample_weight"] is True` and `params["sample_weight"] = [1]`
   - Or: `_requests["sample_weight"]` is some key and `params[that_key] = [1]`
   
2. For "metadata" to be in `res` with value `"a"`:
   - Either: `_requests["metadata"] is True` and `params["metadata"] = "a"`
   - Or: `_requests["metadata"]` is some key and `params[that_key] = "a"`

Let me trace through the logic:

`args = {arg: value for arg, value in params.items() if value is not None}`

So if params = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}, then args = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}

For the simplest case where both values end up in res:
- `_requests["sample_weight"] = True` (since `alias is True and prop in args` → add `args[prop]` to res)
- `_requests["metadata"] = True` (same reason)

Let me verify:
- `params = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}`
- `args = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}`
- For "sample_weight": `alias is True` → `res["sample_weight"] = [1]` ✓
- For "metadata": `alias is True` → `res["metadata"] = "a"` ✓
- `unrequested = {}` (no unrequested items)
- Return `res` ✓

For `owner` and `method`, these aren't used in determining the return value in a way that would show up in output, so they can be any reasonable values. Let me pick generic ones.

`parent` and `caller` also aren't used unless there's an error (unrequested params), which there isn't.
