[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_get_params` to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

The `_get_params` method:
1. Calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)` which returns a dict of base parameters
2. If `deep` is False, returns early with just those base params
3. If `deep` is True, it gets `estimators = getattr(self, attr)`, updates the output, then iterates through estimators to add deep parameters

The output shows:
```
{
    "n_jobs": 1,
    "remainder": "passthrough",
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "transformers": null
}
```

This output contains 4 keys which appear to be the base parameters of a ColumnTransformer-like class.

Since the output only has these 4 simple key-value pairs with no nested parameters (no `__` separators), this suggests:
- Either `deep=False` was passed
- Or `deep=True` but the estimators list is empty or has no estimators with `get_params` method

Looking at the code path:
- If `deep=False`: returns early after `super().get_params(deep=False)`
- If `deep=True`: adds estimators and their deep params

Given the simple output with no deep parameters, the most likely scenario is `deep=False`.

For `attr`: The method needs to call `getattr(self, attr)` when deep=True. Since we're likely in the `deep=False` case, the actual value of `attr` doesn't matter much, but based on context (this is `_BaseComposition` and looking at the `_transformers` function provided), `attr` is likely `"transformers"`.

For the `self` object:
- `transformers`: should be `None` (or a list, but the output shows `null`)
- `remainder`: should be `"passthrough"`
- `n_jobs`: should be `1`
- `transformer_weights`: should be `None`
- `_remainder`, `transformers_`: can be None or any value since they're not directly in the base params

Since `deep=False`, the estimators won't be accessed, so the exact value of `transformers` in self doesn't affect the output, but for consistency with the output showing `"transformers": null`, it should be `None`.
