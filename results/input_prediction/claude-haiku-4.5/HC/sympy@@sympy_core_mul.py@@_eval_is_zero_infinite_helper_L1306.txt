[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` method to understand what input would produce the output `[false, false]`.

The method returns a tuple `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)` which matches the output format `[false, false]`.

Let me analyze the logic:
1. Initialize `seen_zero = False` and `seen_infinite = False`
2. Loop through `self.args`
3. For each argument `a`:
   - If `a.is_zero` is True: check if `seen_infinite` is not False, if so return (None, None). Otherwise set `seen_zero = True`.
   - Elif `a.is_infinite` is True: check if `seen_zero` is not False, if so return (None, None). Otherwise set `seen_infinite = True`.
   - Else: check various conditions to potentially set seen_zero or seen_infinite to None.
4. Return `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)`

To get `(False, False)` as the result:
- We need to return the initial values without them being modified
- This means the loop over `self.args` should either:
  - Have no iterations (empty args), OR
  - All arguments have `is_zero = False`, `is_infinite = False`, and don't trigger the else conditions

The simplest case is when `self.args` is empty. But let's consider another possibility: if we have arguments where all are non-zero, non-infinite, and don't have None values for is_zero or is_infinite.

For a Mul object with no arguments (or effectively empty), or with arguments that are all "normal" (not zero, not infinite, not with None properties), we'd get `(False, False)`.

The most straightforward input would be a `Mul` instance with `args` that is an empty tuple or contains only "normal" expressions (positive constants, for example).

For example, a `Mul` with `args = ()` or `args = (Integer(2), Integer(3))` where these integers have is_zero=False and is_infinite=False.

Let me construct a reasonable input: A Mul instance where args is empty or contains only normal positive integers.

Since we're dealing with a Mul object and the output is `[false, false]`, the self should be a Mul instance. Given the simplest case, an empty multiplication or one with only finite, non-zero multiplicands.

For the structure, "self" should be a Mul instance (represented as a dict or object reference).
