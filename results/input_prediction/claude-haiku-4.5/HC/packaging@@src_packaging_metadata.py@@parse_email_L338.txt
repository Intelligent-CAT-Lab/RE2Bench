[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `parse_email` function to understand what input would produce the given output.

The output is:
```
[
    {
        "download_url": "VaLuE"
    },
    {}
]
```

This is a tuple of two elements:
1. `raw` (RawMetadata): `{"download_url": "VaLuE"}`
2. `unparsed`: `{}`

Working backwards:

1. For `raw` to contain `{"download_url": "VaLuE"}`, we need:
   - A header that maps to `download_url` in the raw metadata
   - The value should be `"VaLuE"`
   - Looking at the code, `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` is used to map email header names to raw field names
   - `download_url` must be in `_STRING_FIELDS` since it's a single string value (not a list)

2. For `unparsed` to be empty `{}`:
   - No headers should fail validation or encoding
   - No description payload issues
   - All parseable headers should end up in `raw`

3. The email header would need to be something like:
   - Header name that maps to "download_url" via `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING`
   - Typically in email metadata, "Download-URL" or similar would map to "download_url"
   - The value would be "VaLuE"

4. For the payload:
   - Either no payload or empty payload
   - Since `unparsed` is empty and there's no "description" in raw, the payload must be handled such that it doesn't create entries

The simplest input would be an email with a single header that maps to download_url with value "VaLuE" and no body.

A typical email format would be:
```
Download-URL: VaLuE
```

Or as bytes:
```
b"Download-URL: VaLuE\r\n\r\n"
```

Let me assume the mapping uses standard header names. The input should be a string or bytes representing an email with:
- A header "Download-URL: VaLuE" (or whatever the actual mapping expects)
- No body or empty body

Since we're not given `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` explicitly, I'll use a reasonable assumption that "Download-URL" maps to "download_url", which is standard for PKG-INFO/metadata files.
