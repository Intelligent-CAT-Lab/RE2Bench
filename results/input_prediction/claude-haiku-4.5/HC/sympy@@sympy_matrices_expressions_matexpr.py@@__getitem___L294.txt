Let me analyze the `__getitem__` method to understand what input would produce the output "X[1, 2]".

Looking at the `__getitem__` method:
1. It first checks if key is a slice (but not a tuple) - this would return a MatrixSlice
2. Then it checks if key is a tuple with length 2
3. If key is a tuple of length 2 with slices, it returns a MatrixSlice
4. If key is a tuple of length 2 with valid indices, it calls `self._entry(i, j)`
5. If key is a single integer or Expr, it does some calculations
6. Otherwise it raises errors

The output is "X[1, 2]", which looks like a string representation. Looking at the code, when we have a tuple key `(i, j)` and `self.valid_index(i, j) != False`, it calls `self._entry(i, j)`.

For a basic MatrixExpr, the `_entry` method returns `MatrixElement(self, i, j)`. When converted to string via `__str__`, a MatrixElement would display as "X[i, j]".

So the input should be:
- `key = (1, 2)` - a tuple with two integers

When `__getitem__` is called with `key = (1, 2)`:
1. It's not a slice by itself
2. It is a tuple with len(key) == 2
3. i, j = 1, 2 (they're not slices)
4. i, j = _sympify(1), _sympify(2) which converts them to Integer(1), Integer(2)
5. valid_index check passes (assuming rows and cols are valid)
6. Returns self._entry(Integer(1), Integer(2))
7. This returns MatrixElement(self, Integer(1), Integer(2))
8. The string representation would be "X[1, 2]"

So the key should be the tuple `(1, 2)`.
