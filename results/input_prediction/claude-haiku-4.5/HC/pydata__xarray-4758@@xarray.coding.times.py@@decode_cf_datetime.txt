Let me analyze this step by step.

The function `decode_cf_datetime` converts numeric dates with units to actual datetime objects.

From the output, I can see 5 datetime values all from 1681-05-27:
- 12:00:00.500000000
- 13:00:00.500000000
- 14:00:00.500000000
- 15:00:00.500000000
- 16:00:00.500000000

These are hourly timestamps with a .5 second offset (500000000 nanoseconds = 0.5 seconds).

Looking at the function flow:
1. `decode_cf_datetime` tries to use `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` first
2. If that fails, it falls back to `_decode_datetime_with_cftime`
3. The units parameter is parsed by `_unpack_netcdf_time_units` which expects format "delta_units since ref_date"
4. The reference date needs to be converted to a pandas Timestamp and combined with the numeric dates multiplied by the time delta

Since the output contains dates from 1681, which is before the pandas datetime64 range (typically 1678-2262), this likely uses `_decode_datetime_with_cftime`. However, the code shows it would try pandas first for standard calendars.

Let me work backwards:
- The dates are hourly increments starting at 12:00:00.500000000
- These are 5 consecutive hours
- The .5 second component suggests the numeric dates might be like [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5] with units "hours since 1681-05-27T12:00:00"

Or more likely, if using pandas/numpy internally:
- With hours since 1681-05-27T12:00:00, numeric values [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5] would give those times
- Or the numeric values could be in a different unit

Given the .5 offset appears on all timestamps, the most logical input would be:
- `num_dates`: [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5] (or similar array)
- `units`: "hours since 1681-05-27T12:00:00"
- `calendar`: "standard" (or None, which defaults to 'standard')

The .5 could also come from milliseconds or microseconds. Let me reconsider - if we have 5 hourly timestamps with .5 second offset, the most straightforward input would be numeric values representing hours since the reference time.

num_dates = [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5] with units "hours since 1681-05-27T12:00:00" would produce exactly this output.

For calendar, since the code tries pandas first for standard calendars, and 1681 is before 1678, it would fail and use cftime. But we should specify the calendar. The default is 'standard' if None is passed, so I'll use that or None or 'standard'.
