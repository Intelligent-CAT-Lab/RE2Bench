[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and trace through the code to understand what input would produce this output.

The output is:
```
[[-1. -1.  2.], [ 1.  1.  5.]]
```

This is a 2D numpy array with shape (2, 3).

Looking at the `_hstack` method:
1. It checks `self.sparse_output_` - if False, it goes to the else branch
2. In the else branch, it converts sparse matrices to dense arrays
3. It then calls `np.hstack(Xs)` which horizontally stacks the arrays

Since the output has shape (2, 3), and this is from horizontal stacking, I need to figure out what arrays were stacked.

The output `[[-1. -1.  2.], [ 1.  1.  5.]]` suggests that `Xs` contains arrays that when horizontally stacked produce this.

Looking at the transform flow and the structure, there's a "scale" transformer and a "remainder" transformer (which is a FunctionTransformer based on the structure).

The most likely scenario:
- Two arrays are being stacked horizontally
- One from "scale" transformer: shape (2, 2) with values like [[-1., -1.], [1., 1.]]
- One from "remainder" transformer: shape (2, 1) with values like [[2.], [5.]]

When horizontally stacked: np.hstack([array1, array2]) would give [[-1., -1., 2.], [1., 1., 5.]]

So `Xs` should be a list containing:
- First array: [[-1., -1.], [1., 1.]]
- Second array: [[2.], [5.]]

Both as numpy arrays.

For the other fields:
- `sparse_output_` should be False (since we're in the else branch)
- The transformers and other fields should be set up as shown in the structure

Let me construct reasonable values for the structure fields:
- `transformers`: list of tuples with transformer specifications
- `remainder`: 'drop' or 'passthrough'
- `sparse_threshold`: typical value like 0.3
- `n_jobs`: None or 1
- `transformer_weights`: None or a dict
- `verbose`: False
- `verbose_feature_names_out`: True
- `n_features_in_`: 3 (since input has 3 features - 2 scaled + 1 remainder)
- `_columns`: list indicating which columns for each transformer
- `_transformer_to_input_indices`: mapping of transformer names to column indices
- `_n_features`: 3
- `_remainder`: tuple for remainder configuration
- `_name_to_fitted_passthrough`: dict with FunctionTransformer for remainder
- `transformers_`: fitted transformers
- `output_indices_`: slices indicating output positions
