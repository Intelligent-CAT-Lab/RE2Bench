[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_format` to understand how it produces the output "jS \\o\\f F".

1. The function `get_format(format_type, lang=None, use_l10n=None)` is called.

2. The output is a string "jS \\o\\f F", which appears to be a date format string.

3. Looking at the function logic:
   - If `use_l10n is None`, it tries to get `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL` or falls back to `settings.USE_L10N`
   - If `use_l10n` is truthy and `lang is None`, it gets the current language
   - It converts `format_type` to string
   - It checks the cache `_format_cache[(format_type, lang)]`
   - If not in cache and `use_l10n` is true, it searches through format modules for the format_type
   - If found in a module, it checks if it's in ISO_INPUT_FORMATS and may append ISO formats
   - If not found or `use_l10n` is false, it gets it from settings
   - The result is cached and returned

4. The output "jS \\o\\f F" is a specific date format string. This looks like a SHORT_DATE_FORMAT or similar format setting.

5. Given that we need to produce this specific output, let me work backwards:
   - `format_type` should be something like "SHORT_DATE_FORMAT" or "DATE_FORMAT" 
   - The function should retrieve this from either the format modules (if `use_l10n=True`) or from settings (if `use_l10n=False`)
   - The output doesn't appear to be a list, so it's not one of the ISO_INPUT_FORMATS
   - This is a simple string return

6. The simplest path to get this output:
   - Set `use_l10n=False` so it directly retrieves from `settings.format_type`
   - Or set `use_l10n=True` and the format module returns this value

7. Since we don't have control over settings, the most straightforward approach is to provide:
   - `format_type`: A format setting key like "SHORT_DATE_FORMAT" or "DATE_FORMAT"
   - `use_l10n`: False (to skip format module lookup and go directly to settings)
   - `lang`: Not used since we're going to settings

8. Looking at the FORMAT_SETTINGS, valid options include: 'SHORT_DATE_FORMAT', 'DATE_FORMAT', etc.

Given the format string "jS \\o\\f F" which looks like Django's date format notation, this is likely a SHORT_DATE_FORMAT or similar. A reasonable guess is:
- `format_type`: "SHORT_DATE_FORMAT" or similar
- `use_l10n`: False
- `lang`: None
