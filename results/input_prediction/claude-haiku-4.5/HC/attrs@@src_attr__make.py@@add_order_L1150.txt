[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `add_order()`:

1. The `add_order` method is called on a `_ClassBuilder` instance
2. Looking at the method:
```python
def add_order(self):
    cd = self._cls_dict
    cd['__lt__'], cd['__le__'], cd['__gt__'], cd['__ge__'] = (self._add_method_dunders(meth) for meth in _make_order(self._cls, self._attrs))
    return self
```

3. The method returns `self`, which when printed would give us the representation of the `_ClassBuilder` instance.

4. The output is `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>"`, which suggests:
   - The class being built is named "A"
   - The `_ClassBuilder` has a proper string representation

5. Looking at the `__init__` method of `_ClassBuilder`, we can see it takes:
   - `cls`: a type/class
   - `these`: attributes (could be None or a dict)
   - `auto_attribs`: boolean
   - `props`: ClassProps object
   - `has_custom_setattr`: boolean

6. For the output to show `cls=A`, the `cls` parameter must be a class named `A`.

7. The structure asks for:
   - `auto_attribs`: A boolean value
   - `these`: Could be None, dict, or other value
   - `has_custom_setattr`: A boolean value

8. Since `add_order()` doesn't depend on the specific values of these parameters for its return (it just returns `self`), any reasonable values would work. However, to be minimal:
   - `auto_attribs`: Can be `False` or `True` - let's use `False` as a default
   - `these`: Can be `None` or empty - let's use `None`
   - `has_custom_setattr`: Can be `False` or `True` - let's use `False` as a default

The method simply modifies `self._cls_dict` and returns `self`, so the output format `<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>` depends on how `_ClassBuilder` implements its `__repr__` method (which isn't shown, but the output format suggests it shows the class name).
