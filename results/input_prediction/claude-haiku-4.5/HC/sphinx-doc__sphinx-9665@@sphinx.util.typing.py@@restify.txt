[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `restify` function to determine what input would produce the output `:py:obj:`None``.

Looking at the function:
```python
def restify(cls: Optional[Type]) -> str:
    try:
        if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
            return ':py:obj:`None`'
```

The function immediately checks if `cls is None or cls is NoneType`. If either condition is true, it returns `:py:obj:`None``.

The output we need to match is `:py:obj:`None``, which is exactly what the first condition returns.

So the input `cls` should be either:
1. `None` (the Python None value)
2. `NoneType` (which is `type(None)`)

The simplest and most direct input would be `None` itself, since `None is None` evaluates to `True`, and the function would immediately return the expected output on the first condition check.

Let me verify: if `cls = None`, then:
- `cls is None` → True
- Function returns `:py:obj:`None`` ✓

This matches the expected output.
