[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `prepare_url` method to understand what input would produce a `null` output.

1. The method returns `None` implicitly (no explicit return statement), so the output is always `None`.

2. Looking at the code flow:
   - First, it converts the url to a string if needed
   - It strips leading whitespace
   - Then there's a check: `if ':' in url and (not url.lower().startswith('http')):`
     - If this is true, it sets `self.url = url` and returns early
     - This would produce a `null` output

3. For the early return condition to trigger, we need:
   - A URL that contains ':' (colon)
   - A URL that does NOT start with 'http' or 'HTTP' etc.
   - Example: "file:///path/to/file", "ftp://example.com", "custom:scheme"

4. Let me pick a simple example that satisfies this: `url = "file:///path/to/file"`
   - Contains ':' ✓
   - Doesn't start with 'http' ✓
   - Will trigger the early return

5. For `params`, the structure shows `{}` (empty dict), which is fine.

6. For `self`, since we're just initializing and the method returns early before using most fields, I can use the default initialized values:
   - method: None
   - headers: None
   - _cookies: None
   - body: None
   - _body_position: None
   - hooks.response: [] (default from default_hooks())

Let me verify: With `url = "file:///path"`:
- Line 1: Not bytes, so `url = str(url)` = "file:///path"
- Line 2: `url = url.lstrip()` = "file:///path"
- Line 3: `:` is in url ✓, and `url.lower().startswith('http')` is False ✓
- So it executes `self.url = url` and `return` (implicitly returns None)
- Output: `null` ✓
