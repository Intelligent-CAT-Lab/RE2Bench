[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output to understand what input would produce it.

The function `_row_reduce_list` returns a tuple of three elements:
1. `mat` - the modified matrix as a list
2. `pivot_cols` - tuple of pivot column indices
3. `swaps` - tuple of row swaps performed

From the output:
- `mat = ["-9", "-17", "-19", "0", "-8", "-37", "0", "0", "-243"]` (a flat list)
- `pivot_cols = (0, 1, 2)` 
- `swaps = ()` (empty tuple, no swaps)

The matrix appears to be a 3x3 matrix stored as a flat list. With cols=3 and rows=3:
- Row 0: ["-9", "-17", "-19"]
- Row 1: ["0", "-8", "-37"]
- Row 2: ["0", "0", "-243"]

This looks like a matrix in row echelon form (upper triangular).

The pivot columns are 0, 1, 2 (all three columns are pivots), and no swaps were performed (swaps is empty).

For the input parameters:
- `mat`: Should be a 3x3 matrix that when row-reduced produces the output above. The output shows strings, so the input likely contains numeric/symbolic values that evaluate to these.
- `rows`: 3
- `cols`: 3
- `one`: This is the multiplicative identity. For numeric matrices, it would be `1` or `Integer(1)` from sympy. Given the string output contains integer-like values, `one` is likely `1`.
- `iszerofunc`: A function to test if something is zero, defaulted to `_iszero`
- `simpfunc`: A simplification function, defaulted to `_simplify`
- `normalize_last`: Boolean, default True
- `normalize`: Boolean, default True
- `zero_above`: Boolean, default True

Since no swaps occurred and the matrix is in perfect upper triangular form, the input matrix likely was already close to this form or had a structure that didn't require row swaps.

Given that the output contains string representations of integers, and considering the structure, a reasonable input would be:
- A 3x3 matrix with integer entries
- Standard parameters for row reduction

Let me construct a plausible input that would produce this output. The output suggests the matrix has been reduced to row echelon form with pivots at columns 0, 1, 2.

A simple input could be:
- `mat = [-9, -17, -19, 0, -8, -37, 0, 0, -243]` (already in the output form, or close to it)
- Or an input matrix that reduces to this form

Since we don't have the exact simplification behavior, I'll assume the input matrix is something that row-reduces to the given output. A reasonable starting matrix might involve integer or symbolic values.

Given the constraints and that this is a sympy matrix reduction function, I'll assume:
- `one = 1` (numeric one) or possibly sympy's `S.One` or `Integer(1)`
- `iszerofunc = _iszero` (the default)
- `simpfunc = _simplify` (the default)
- Default boolean values: `normalize_last=True`, `normalize=True`, `zero_above=True`

For the input `mat`, I need something that reduces to the output. Let me assume a matrix that needs reduction:

```
[-9, -17, -19]
[0, -8, -37]
[0, 0, -243]
```

This is already in row echelon form, so the input could be this exact matrix, or a matrix that reduces to it.

Given the output strings are "-9", "-17", etc., I'll assume the input uses numeric values (likely integers or sympy Integer objects).
