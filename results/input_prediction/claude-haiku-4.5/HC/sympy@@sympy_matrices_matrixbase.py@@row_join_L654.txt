[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution to understand what inputs would produce the output `Matrix([\n[1, 0, 1, 0],\n[0, 1, 0, 1]])`.

The output shows a 2x4 matrix:
```
[1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1]
```

The `row_join` function concatenates two matrices horizontally (along columns). Looking at the code:
1. It checks if `self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows` - if so, it creates a new matrix and joins
2. It checks if `self.rows != other.rows` - if dimensions don't match, it raises ShapeError
3. Otherwise it calls `_eval_row_join(other)`

The result is a 2x4 matrix. This could be formed by:
- Joining a 2x2 matrix with another 2x2 matrix horizontally
- Joining a 2x3 matrix with a 2x1 matrix
- Other combinations

Looking at the example documentation in the code:
```python
>>> M = zeros(3)  # 3x3 matrix of zeros
>>> V = ones(3, 1)  # 3x1 matrix of ones
>>> M.row_join(V)
Matrix([
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1]])
```

For our output `[[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]` (2x4), a reasonable split would be:
- `self` is the 2x2 identity matrix: `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`
- `other` is the 2x2 identity matrix: `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`

This makes sense because when you join two 2x2 identity matrices horizontally, you get:
`[[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]`

For `self`:
- rows = 2
- cols = 2
- The representation would be a matrix with elements [1, 0, 0, 1] (row-major order for identity matrix)

For `other`:
- Same as `self` - another 2x2 identity matrix

The `_rep` field stores the internal representation (likely a DomainMatrix). For an identity matrix in sparse or dense representation, it would represent `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.

Since we're dealing with matrices, I need to represent them appropriately. The _rep is typically a DomainMatrix object, but since this is about structure, I'll describe it as the conceptual matrix representation.

For a 2x2 identity matrix, the `_rep` would represent elements at positions (0,0)=1, (1,1)=1 with zeros elsewhere.

Let me use simple representations:
- `self`: 2x2 identity matrix 
- `other`: 2x2 identity matrix
