[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_get_empty_routing()`:

1. `_get_empty_routing` calls `self._iter(fitted=False, column_as_labels=False, skip_drop=True, skip_empty_columns=True)`

2. In `_iter` with `fitted=False`:
   - It constructs transformers from `self.transformers` and `self._columns`
   - The output shows only one transformer named "trans" in the result dictionary
   - This means only one transformer passed through the filters

3. The filters applied are:
   - `skip_drop=True`: skips transformers where `trans == 'drop'`
   - `skip_empty_columns=True`: skips transformers with empty column selections

4. The result dictionary has a single key "trans" with all METHODS as keys, each mapping to an empty dict `{}`

5. This means:
   - There is exactly one transformer in the iteration: `("trans", some_transformer, some_columns, weight)`
   - This transformer is not 'drop'
   - This transformer doesn't have empty columns
   - The transformer_weights likely doesn't have "trans" key (so weight is None)

6. For the iteration to work with `fitted=False`:
   - `self.transformers` should be a list with at least one tuple `(name, transformer, columns)`
   - `self._columns` should align with this
   - `self._remainder` should be set but either empty or skipped (since skip_drop=True would skip 'drop', and we only see "trans")

7. The structure requires:
   - `_transformer_to_input_indices`: a dict with "trans" key (and possibly "remainder")
   - `_remainder`: a tuple `(name, transformer, columns)` 
   - `_columns`: should have entries corresponding to transformers
   - Other fields from __init__

8. Since the output only shows "trans", I need to set up:
   - `transformers`: `[('trans', SomeTransformer(), [0])]` (or similar)
   - `_columns`: `[[0]]` 
   - `_transformer_to_input_indices`: `{"trans": [0]}` at minimum
   - `_remainder`: should be set to something, likely `("remainder", "drop", [])` or similar

Let me construct minimal valid input that produces this output:

```python
{
    "transformers": [("trans", "linear_model", [0])],
    "_columns": [[0]],
    "_transformer_to_input_indices": {
        "trans": [0],
        "remainder": []
    },
    "_remainder": ("remainder", "drop", [])
}
```

But I need to be more careful. The remainder tuple has 3 elements in _iter. With skip_drop=True, if remainder is "drop", it will be skipped. So the only transformer yielded is "trans".

Let me set reasonable defaults for all required fields:
- `remainder`: 'drop' (default)
- `sparse_threshold`: 0.3 (default)
- `n_jobs`: None (default)
- `transformer_weights`: None (default)
- `verbose`: False (default)
- `verbose_feature_names_out`: True (default)
- `force_int_remainder_cols`: 'deprecated' (default)
- `n_features_in_`: some value like 10 (not used in _get_empty_routing but part of fitted state)

For _remainder to work, I need it to be a 3-tuple. With skip_drop=True and remainder='drop', the remainder would be skipped anyway.

Actually, looking more carefully at the code in _iter:
```python
if self._remainder[2]:  # Only adds remainder if third element is truthy
    transformers = chain(transformers, [self._remainder])
```

So `_remainder[2]` determines if remainder is added. Since we only see "trans" in output, `_remainder[2]` must be False or `_remainder[2]` is something falsy, or the remainder was filtered out by skip_drop.

Most likely: `_remainder[2]` is False or empty, so remainder isn't added to the chain, and we only process the "trans" transformer.

Let me construct a minimal valid state:
```
transformers = [("trans", SomeTransformer, [0])]
_columns = [[0]]
_transformer_to_input_indices = {"trans": [0], "remainder": []}
_remainder = ("remainder", "drop", False)  # False means don't include it
```

For the transformer object itself, I can just use a string or simple object since it's not called in _get_empty_routing.
