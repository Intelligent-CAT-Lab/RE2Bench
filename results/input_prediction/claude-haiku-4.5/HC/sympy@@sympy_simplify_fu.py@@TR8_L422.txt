[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine what input would produce `cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2`.

The output `cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2` is a simplified trigonometric expression. This looks like it could come from a product of trigonometric functions being simplified.

Let me think about what common trigonometric identities could produce this:
- `sin(phi)*cos(phi) = sin(2*phi)/2`
- `cos(phi)^2 = (1 + cos(2*phi))/2`
- `sin(phi)^2 = (1 - cos(2*phi))/2`

So if we had `cos(phi)^2`, it would expand to `(1 + cos(2*phi))/2 = 1/2 + cos(2*phi)/2`, which matches our output!

Let me verify this logic through the TR8 function:
1. Input: `cos(phi)**2` with `first=True` (default)
2. Since it's a Pow with cos base and integer exponent, it enters the function
3. When `first=True`, it expands numerator and denominator, then recursively calls TR8 with `first=False`
4. With `first=False`, it processes the cos terms and applies trigonometric reductions
5. For `cos(phi)**2`, using the identity `cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2`, this should simplify

Actually, looking at the code more carefully, the TR8 function is designed to work with products of sin and cos terms using product-to-sum formulas. For a single `cos(phi)**2`, it would recognize this as `cos` with exponent 2.

In the args dictionary construction:
- `cos(phi)**2` would be recognized as `a.base.func in (cos, sin)` with `a.exp == 2`
- It would add `cos(phi)` twice to `args[cos]`
- Since `len(c) > 1` and no sin terms, it would pop two cosines and apply the product-to-sum formula
- For two cosines: `(cos(a1 + a2) + cos(a1 - a2))/2 = (cos(2*phi) + cos(0))/2 = (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2`

This matches our output!

So the input should be `cos(phi)**2` with `first=True` (the default).

Let me represent this in SymPy notation. I'll need to express this as a symbolic input. Based on the code, `rv` should be a SymPy expression.

```python
cos(phi)**2
```

Since `first` defaults to `True`, we should use that as the default value.
