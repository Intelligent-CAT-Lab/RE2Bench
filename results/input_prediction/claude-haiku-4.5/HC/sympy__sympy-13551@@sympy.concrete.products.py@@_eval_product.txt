<THOUGHT>
Let me analyze the output to understand what inputs to `_eval_product` would produce this result.

The output shows:
```
RisingFactorial(u + v + 1, -v)*RisingFactorial(u + v + 4, -v)/(RisingFactorial(u + v - 1, -v)*RisingFactorial(u + v + 3, -v))
```

This is a product of RisingFactorial terms. Looking at the `_eval_product` method, it handles various cases including when `term.is_Add` (the term is an addition).

The method has this branch:
```python
elif term.is_Add:
    p, q = term.as_numer_denom()
    q = self._eval_product(q, (k, a, n))
    if q.is_Number:
        from sympy.concrete.summations import Sum
        p = exp(Sum(log(p), (k, a, n)))
    else:
        p = self._eval_product(p, (k, a, n))
    return p / q
```

So the term should be an Add (fraction/ratio) that when split into numerator and denominator gives RisingFactorial expressions.

Looking at the pattern, it appears we have a product involving RisingFactorial terms. The output shows alternating numerator and denominator terms, suggesting a pattern like:
- numerator: RisingFactorial(u + v + 1, -v) and RisingFactorial(u + v + 4, -v)
- denominator: RisingFactorial(u + v - 1, -v) and RisingFactorial(u + v + 3, -v)

This looks like it could come from a product of a rational expression (Add with multiple terms) being evaluated.

Given the structure and the fact that RisingFactorial appears with negative arguments, the term is likely a ratio of products.

The limits would be a tuple (k, a, n) where:
- k is the summation/product variable
- a is the lower bound
- n is the upper bound

For a product resulting in RisingFactorial with -v as the second argument, we'd likely have limits like (k, 0, v) or similar, where the negative comes from the RisingFactorial evaluation.

Let me construct a plausible input. The term should be something that when processed through the Add branch produces this output.

A reasonable input would be:
- term: A rational expression (ratio) 
- limits: (k, a, b) where a and b are symbolic

Looking at RisingFactorial properties, RF(x, n) represents x*(x+1)*...*(x+n-1) for positive n, and for negative n it represents 1/((x-1)*(x-2)*...*(x-|n|)).

The output pattern suggests the term might be something like:
`((u + v + 1 + k)*(u + v + 4 + k)) / ((u + v - 1 + k)*(u + v + 3 + k))`

And limits might be `(k, 0, v)` or `(k, 1, v)`.

Actually, examining more carefully, if this is a product over k from some value, the RisingFactorial with -v would come from taking a product and recognizing it as a RisingFactorial.

Let me assume:
- term: `(u + v + 1)*(u + v + 4) / ((u + v - 1)*(u + v + 3))`  (or as an Add/Mul expression)
- limits: `(k, 1, v)` or similar

But more likely, given the polynomial structure, the term is likely a single rational polynomial expression.
