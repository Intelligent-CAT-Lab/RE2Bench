[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what `get_stretch` does and what input would produce the output "normal".

Looking at the `get_stretch` method:
```python
def get_stretch(self):
    return self._stretch
```

This is a simple getter that returns the `_stretch` attribute of the object.

Given that the output is:
```
{
    "output": "normal"
}
```

This means `self._stretch` must equal `"normal"`.

Now, let's understand how `_stretch` gets set. Looking at `set_stretch`:
```python
def set_stretch(self, stretch):
    stretch = mpl._val_or_rc(stretch, 'font.stretch')
    if stretch in stretch_dict:
        self._stretch = stretch
        return
    try:
        stretch = int(stretch)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        if 0 <= stretch <= 1000:
            self._stretch = stretch
            return
    raise ValueError(f'stretch={stretch!r} is invalid')
```

The method accepts a stretch value and validates it. If the value is in `stretch_dict` (which would include "normal"), it sets `self._stretch = stretch`.

For a `FontProperties` object to have `_stretch = "normal"`, either:
1. It was explicitly set via `set_stretch("normal")` 
2. It was set through `__init__` with `stretch="normal"`
3. It was set through a fontconfig pattern

Since we just need the `get_stretch` method to return "normal", we need `self._stretch` to be "normal".

For the other attributes, we need to provide reasonable default values. Looking at `__init__`, these get set through the setter methods. If we trace through with all None parameters, the setters would use the RC (runtime configuration) defaults. However, for the purpose of this test, we can use typical default values.

Let me set up the input:
- `_stretch` should be `"normal"` (this is what gets returned)
- Other attributes can be set to reasonable defaults based on what the setters would produce

Looking at the setters:
- `_family` would be a list (from `set_family`)
- `_slant` would be a string like "normal" (from `set_style`)
- `_variant` would be a string like "normal" (from `set_variant`)
- `_weight` would be a string or int (from `set_weight`)
- `_file` would be None or a path string (from `set_file`)
- `_size` would be a float (from `set_size`)
- `_math_fontfamily` would be a string (from `set_math_fontfamily`)

Since we want a minimal but valid state, I'll use typical defaults:
