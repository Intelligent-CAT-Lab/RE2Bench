Let me trace through the `_safe_repr` function to understand what inputs would produce the output `["'dictionary'", true, false]`.

The function returns a tuple of (repr_string, readable, recursive).

Given output:
- repr_string: "'dictionary'"
- readable: true
- recursive: false

Let me analyze the possible code paths:

1. If `typ in pprint._builtin_scalars`:
   - Returns (repr(object), True, False)
   - This would match if object is a builtin scalar like string, int, etc.
   - If object is the string "dictionary", then repr("dictionary") = "'dictionary'"
   - This matches our output!

2. Other paths (dict, list, tuple, BaseEstimator) would have different return patterns.

So the object is most likely a string: "dictionary"

For the context, looking at the function, it creates an entry `context[objid] = 1` for objects it's processing to detect recursion. The context is passed with the id of some object already in it (124132985094608). Since we're taking the first path (builtin scalar), the context dictionary is used but not modified in this case.

The `maxlevels` and `level` parameters aren't used in the builtin scalars path, but they're still passed. They could be any reasonable values. Let me look at typical usage - level is usually incremented and checked against maxlevels. A common pattern is level=0 when first called, and maxlevels=None (which means unlimited).

The `changed_only` parameter defaults to False.

So the inputs should be:
- object: "dictionary" (a string)
- context: A dictionary with at least the entry "124132985094608" pointing to some value (the value doesn't matter since we don't modify it in the builtin scalars path)
- maxlevels: Could be None, or any number (not used in this path)
- level: Could be 0, 1, or any number (not used in this path)
- changed_only: False (default)

Let me verify: `repr("dictionary")` returns `"'dictionary'"` ✓

The readable is True for builtin scalars ✓

The recursive is False for builtin scalars ✓
