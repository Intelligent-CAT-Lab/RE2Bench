[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output to understand what input would produce `[[0. 0.]]`.

The output shows a 1x2 array with values `[[0. 0.]]`, which indicates:
- 1 sample
- 2 features in the output
- Both values are 0.0

Looking at the `transform` method:
1. It calls `_transform` which returns `X_int` (integer encoded values) and `X_mask` (boolean mask)
2. It maps infrequent categories
3. It handles dropping categories
4. It builds a sparse matrix from the data

The output `[[0. 0.]]` suggests:
- The sparse matrix is converted to a dense array (since `sparse_output=False` or the output is dense)
- We have 1 sample with 2 one-hot encoded features, both being 0

For a one-hot encoding to produce `[[0. 0.]]`, this means:
- Both positions are 0, which happens when categories are dropped or when we have unknown categories that map to 0
- Or it could mean the input had values that don't match any categories

Let me think about what would produce this:
- If we have 2 input features, each with categories
- And the one-hot output is `[[0. 0.]]` for 1 sample

This could happen if:
- Each feature has 1 category, and that category is dropped, leaving 0 output features per input feature
- Or each feature produces 1 output and we get [0, 0]

Looking at the sparse matrix construction, the output shape is `(n_samples, feature_indices[-1])` where `feature_indices[-1]` is the sum of output features.

For output `[[0. 0.]]`:
- n_samples = 1
- output has 2 columns
- all values are 0

This could mean:
- 2 input features each producing 1 output column
- The values are all 0 (unknown or dropped)

Let me construct the state:
- `categories_`: should have 2 features (since we get 2 output columns)
- Each category list should have some values
- `_n_features_outs`: should be [1, 1] to produce 2 output columns total
- Input X should have 1 sample with values that don't match categories (to get 0s when mapped)

Actually, looking more carefully:
- If we have categories [['a', 'b'], ['x', 'y']] and input [[unknown, unknown]]
- With handle_unknown='ignore', unknown values map to 0 (mask is False)
- The sparse matrix construction uses the mask to determine which cells to include

For the output to be `[[0. 0.]]`, we need a 1x2 dense array.

Let me think simpler:
- 2 features with simple categories
- 1 sample 
- Input values that produce all zeros in the one-hot encoding

One simple case:
- categories_: [['a'], ['b']]
- drop: [None, None]
- Input: [['a', 'b']]
- This would give: first feature 'a' maps to index 0 → one-hot [1], second feature 'b' maps to index 0 → one-hot [1]
- So output would be [[1., 1.]], not [[0., 0.]]

For [[0., 0.]], maybe:
- categories_: [['a', 'b'], ['x', 'y']]
- drop: ['first', 'first']  (drop first category from each)
- Input: [['a', 'x']]
- First feature 'a' is category 0, but we drop it, so we get 0
- Second feature 'x' is category 0, but we drop it, so we get 0
- Output: [[0., 0.]]

This makes sense!

So the input should be:
- X: a single sample with values ['a', 'x'] or similar that match the first category
- categories_: [['a', 'b'], ['x', 'y']]
- drop: ['first', 'first']
- _drop_idx_after_grouping: [0, 0]
- drop_idx_: [0, 0]
- _n_features_outs: [1, 1]
