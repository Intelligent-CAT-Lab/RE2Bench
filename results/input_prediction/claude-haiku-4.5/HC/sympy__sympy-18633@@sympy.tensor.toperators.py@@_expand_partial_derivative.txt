[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_expand_partial_derivative` method to understand what conditions would lead to the output where `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are all `null`.

Looking at the `_expand_partial_derivative` method:

```python
def _expand_partial_derivative(self):
    args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
    obj = self.func(*args)
    obj._indices = indices
    obj._free = free
    obj._dum = dum
    result = obj
    if not args[0].free_symbols:
        return S.Zero
    elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensAdd):
        result = obj.expr.func(*[self.func(a, *obj.variables)._expand_partial_derivative() for a in result.expr.args])
    elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensMul):
        if len(obj.variables) == 1:
            terms = []
            mulargs = list(obj.expr.args)
            for ind in range(len(mulargs)):
                if not isinstance(sympify(mulargs[ind]), Number):
                    d = self.func(mulargs[ind], *obj.variables)._expand_partial_derivative()
                    terms.append(TensMul(*mulargs[:ind] + [d] + mulargs[ind + 1:]))
            result = TensAdd.fromiter(terms)
        else:
            result = obj.expr
            for v in obj.variables:
                result = self.func(result, v)._expand_partial_derivative()
    return result
```

The method returns early with `S.Zero` if `not args[0].free_symbols` is True (i.e., if args[0] has no free symbols).

For the output to have `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all as `null`, the PartialDerivative object being returned must have these attributes set to `null`.

However, looking at the code flow:
1. When we return `S.Zero`, we're returning a number, not a PartialDerivative object
2. When we return `result` which is a `TensAdd` or modified value, those would have their own attributes

The output structure shows attributes `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` with `null` values. This suggests we're looking at a PartialDerivative object that hasn't had these attributes properly set or has been created with None values.

Looking at `__new__`:
```python
def __new__(cls, expr, *variables):
    if isinstance(expr, PartialDerivative):
        variables = expr.variables + variables
        expr = expr.expr
    args, indices, free, dum = cls._contract_indices_for_derivative(S(expr), variables)
    obj = TensExpr.__new__(cls, *args)
    obj._indices = indices
    obj._free = free
    obj._dum = dum
    return obj
```

So a PartialDerivative created through `__new__` would have `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` set to the values returned from `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.

For these to be `null` (None), the `_contract_indices_for_derivative` method would need to return None values. Looking at that method, it returns a tuple of (args, indices, free, dum), and these should not be None under normal circumstances.

However, the most straightforward interpretation is that we're looking for a PartialDerivative object where these attributes are explicitly set to None. This could happen if:

1. A PartialDerivative is created and then its attributes are set to None
2. Or more likely, we're initializing a PartialDerivative with input that results in None values

Given that the method `_expand_partial_derivative` doesn't return a modified PartialDerivative with None attributes, and the output shows all three as null, the input `self` object must already have these attributes as None.

This would be the case for a PartialDerivative that was just instantiated but for some reason has None values for these internal attributes. The simplest case would be a PartialDerivative created with minimal/empty arguments or one that failed initialization.

Actually, looking more carefully - if `_contract_indices_for_derivative` returns None values somehow, that could cause this. But that seems unlikely given the implementation.

The most reasonable interpretation is that `self` is a PartialDerivative object with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all set to None initially. Since `_expand_partial_derivative` is a method that would be called on an existing PartialDerivative object, and the output shows these three attributes as null, the input must be a PartialDerivative that was constructed in such a way that these attributes are None.

Since there are no args specified in the structure for this method, it's an instance method being called. The most straightforward case would be a PartialDerivative with minimal initialization where these attributes weren't properly set.
