[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `_eval_expand_mul` method to understand what input would produce the output "-sin(phi)**2".

Looking at the `_eval_expand_mul` method:
1. It takes `self` (a Mul object) and `**hints` (keyword arguments)
2. It calls `fraction(expr, hints.get('exact', False))` to split into numerator and denominator
3. It processes the expression to expand multiplications with sums

The output is "-sin(phi)**2", which is a negative sine squared expression.

To work backwards:
- The output "-sin(phi)**2" could come from expanding something like "(-1)*sin(phi)**2" or an expression that simplifies to this
- Since we need hints as kwargs with keys like 'power_base', 'power_exp', 'mul', 'log', 'multinomial', 'basic', these appear to be expand hints

For `self`, I need a Mul expression that would expand to "-sin(phi)**2". A reasonable input would be something like:
- A multiplication expression: `-sin(phi)*sin(phi)` or similar

Actually, looking more carefully at the code flow:
1. `fraction(expr, ...)` is called on `self`
2. The expression is processed through expand_mul logic
3. If there are Add terms (sums), they get expanded

For the output "-sin(phi)**2", a simple input would be:
- `self` = Mul(-1, sin(phi)**2) or Mul(-sin(phi), sin(phi))

The hints dictionary typically contains boolean flags for different expansion types. Standard expand hints include 'power_base', 'power_exp', 'mul', 'log', 'multinomial', 'basic' - these are all boolean flags.

Let me construct a reasonable input:
- `self` should be a Mul object representing something like: -sin(phi)**2 or -1*sin(phi)**2
- The hints would be the standard expand hints, likely all False or some combination

Since the output is just "-sin(phi)**2", and this is already expanded, the hints probably don't matter much. The simplest case would be if `self` already represents "-sin(phi)**2" and the method just returns it as-is.

For the actual object representation, I'll use symbolic notation since this is SymPy:
- `self` would be represented as the string representation of the Mul object

Given the structure asks for specific hint keys, I should provide boolean values for each:
- power_base: False
- power_exp: False  
- mul: False
- log: False
- multinomial: False
- basic: False

And `self` should be "-sin(phi)**2" or the Mul representation of it.
