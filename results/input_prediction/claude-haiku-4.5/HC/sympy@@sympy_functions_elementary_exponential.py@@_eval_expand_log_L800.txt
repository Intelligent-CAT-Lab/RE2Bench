<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the code to understand what input would produce the output "log(5)".

Looking at the `_eval_expand_log` method in the `log` class, I need to find which code path produces just `log(5)` without expansion.

The method has several branches:
1. If `len(self.args) == 2`, it calls `expand_log`
2. If `arg.is_Integer`, it checks for perfect powers and factors
3. If `arg.is_Rational`, it returns `log(arg.p) - log(arg.q)`
4. If `arg.is_Mul`, it expands the product
5. If `arg.is_Pow` or `isinstance(arg, exp)`, it handles powers
6. If `isinstance(arg, Product)`, it converts to a Sum
7. Default: `return self.func(arg)` - returns `log(arg)` unchanged

For the output to be `log(5)`, we need a case where the input argument `5` doesn't match any of the special expansion conditions, or where expansion doesn't change anything.

Since `5` is an Integer:
- `arg.is_Integer` would be True
- `perfect_power(5)` would return False (5 is not a perfect power)
- `factor` parameter would determine if we factorize
- If we don't factorize (factor=False), and 5 is not a perfect power, then `logarg` remains None
- The method then returns `self.func(arg)` which is `log(5)`

So the input should be:
- `self` is a `log` instance with argument 5
- The argument `arg` should be 5 (an Integer)
- `deep` can be True (default)
- `force` should be False (default)
- `factor` should be False to avoid factorization
- Other expand-related kwargs don't matter as much since we're not calling expand

The structure asks for:
- `self.nargs`: For a `log(5)` call, nargs should be 1 (single argument)
- `deep`: True (standard default)
- `force`: False (default)
- `factor`: False (to avoid expansion)
- `power_base`, `power_exp`, `mul`, `log`, `multinomial`, `basic`: These are expansion hints that default to False

Actually, looking more carefully at the structure provided and the function signature:
```python
def _eval_expand_log(self, deep=True, **hints):
```

The kwargs contains things like `force`, `factor`, etc. which come from the `hints` dictionary.

For input `log(5)`:
- The argument is the integer 5
- Since 5 is not a perfect power and factor=False, no expansion occurs
- It returns `self.func(arg)` which is `log(5)`

The nargs in the structure probably refers to the number of arguments to the log function, which is 1.
