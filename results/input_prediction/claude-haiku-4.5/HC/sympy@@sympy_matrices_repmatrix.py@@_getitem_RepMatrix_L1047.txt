Let me trace through the execution to determine what input would produce the output "cos(phi)".

The function `_getitem_RepMatrix` is called with a key and returns a value. The output is "cos(phi)", which appears to be a SymPy expression.

Looking at the code flow:
1. If `key` is a tuple `(i, j)`, it tries `self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j))`
2. If that succeeds and returns a value, it returns that value
3. Otherwise, it handles slices, sequences, etc.

Since the output is a single expression "cos(phi)" (not a list or matrix), the key is likely not a tuple or is a single element access.

If `key` is not a tuple, we go to the `else` branch:
- It gets `rows, cols` from `self.shape`
- If the matrix is not empty, it calculates `values`
- If `key` is a slice, it returns `values` (a list)
- Otherwise, it returns `values[0]` (a single element)

Since the output is a single value "cos(phi)", `key` must not be a slice.

The code path appears to be:
1. `key` is not a tuple (single index access)
2. `rows * cols > 0` (non-empty matrix)
3. `is_slice = False`
4. `values = [rep.getitem(*divmod(index_(key), cols))]`
5. Domain conversion if needed
6. `return values[0]` which is "cos(phi)"

So `rep.getitem(*divmod(index_(key), cols))` must return "cos(phi)" (or something that converts to it).

For a simple case, let's assume:
- `key = 0` (accessing first element)
- The matrix has at least 1 element
- `cols >= 1`
- The internal representation stores "cos(phi)" at position (0, 0)
- `divmod(0, cols) = (0, 0)`

Or alternatively, if the matrix is 1D access (like accessing a flattened matrix):
- `key = 0` means first element
- If `cols = 1` (single column), `divmod(0, 1) = (0, 0)`
- If `cols = 2`, `divmod(0, 2) = (0, 0)`

Let me construct a minimal example:
- `rows = 1, cols = 1` (1x1 matrix)
- `key = 0` (accessing the single element)
- The internal `_rep` stores "cos(phi)" at position [0][0]

Actually, looking more carefully at the code, when `key` is an integer (not a tuple), it's treating the matrix as a flat array. So:
- `key = 0` means first element overall
- `divmod(0, cols)` gives row and column indices

For the simplest case with output "cos(phi)":
- `rows = 1, cols = 1`
- `key = 0`
- `_rep.rep.getitem(0, 0)` returns something that evaluates to "cos(phi)"

Or more realistically for a matrix with multiple elements where we access element 0 of a 1x1 matrix or any NxM matrix where element at index 0 is "cos(phi)".
