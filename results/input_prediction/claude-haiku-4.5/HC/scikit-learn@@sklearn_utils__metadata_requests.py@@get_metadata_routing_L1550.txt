[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_metadata_routing()`:

1. `get_metadata_routing()` calls `self._get_metadata_request()`

2. In `_get_metadata_request()`:
   - It checks `if hasattr(self, "_metadata_request")`
   - If true, it calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)` and returns that
   - If false, it creates a new `MetadataRequest` and populates it

3. Looking at the output, we have a dictionary with 'fit', 'transform', and 'inverse_transform' methods, each with their own metadata request mappings.

4. The output structure suggests that `_metadata_request` already exists on the object (since we're getting a populated routing object back), meaning `hasattr(self, "_metadata_request")` is True.

5. When `hasattr(self, "_metadata_request")` is True, the function calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)` which returns the routing information.

6. The output shows the structure of metadata requests for different methods with their parameter mappings.

So the input should have:
- `self._metadata_request` set to some object that, when passed through `get_routing_for_object()`, produces the output shown
- This means `_metadata_request` should contain the metadata request configuration

Based on the output format, `_metadata_request` should be a MetadataRequest object or similar structure that contains the routing information for fit, transform, and inverse_transform methods.

For the registry, it's typically part of the class but not directly used in this method's logic for this particular execution path.

Since `_metadata_request` exists, it should be set to a routing object that contains the metadata request information shown in the output.
