[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution to understand what input would produce the given output.

The function `get_family` is:
```python
def get_family(self):
    return self._family
```

This simply returns `self._family`.

The output is:
```json
{
    "output": ["Helvetica"]
}
```

So `self._family` must be `["Helvetica"]`.

Now, let me think about how `_family` gets set. Looking at `__init__`, it calls:
```python
self.set_family(family)
```

And `set_family` does:
```python
def set_family(self, family):
    family = mpl._val_or_rc(family, 'font.family')
    if isinstance(family, str):
        family = [family]
    self._family = family
```

So if we want `self._family = ["Helvetica"]`, we need `family` (after the `mpl._val_or_rc` call) to be either:
1. Already a list: `["Helvetica"]`
2. A string: `"Helvetica"` (which gets converted to `["Helvetica"]`)

For the other attributes in the structure, since the `get_family` method only returns `self._family`, the other attributes don't affect the output. However, they must be properly initialized if we want a complete FontProperties object. Let me check what values they would have after a typical initialization.

If we initialize `FontProperties()` with no arguments (or just `family="Helvetica"`), the other attributes would be set to their default values via the setter methods. Let me think about reasonable defaults:
- `_slant` (style): defaults to 'normal'
- `_variant`: defaults to 'normal'
- `_weight`: defaults to 'normal' (from weight_dict)
- `_stretch`: defaults to 'normal' (from stretch_dict)
- `_file`: defaults to None
- `_size`: defaults to the default font size
- `_math_fontfamily`: defaults to mpl.rcParams['mathtext.fontset']

However, since we're asked to predict the input to `get_family` and only looking at what would produce the output `["Helvetica"]`, the minimal requirement is that `_family = ["Helvetica"]`.

For the other fields, since they're not used in `get_family`, I can set them to reasonable values or None/default values. The most straightforward approach is to assume a simple initialization.

Let me set the other attributes to plausible defaults that would occur after initialization with family="Helvetica":
- _slant: 'normal'
- _variant: 'normal'
- _weight: 'normal'
- _stretch: 'normal'
- _file: None
- _size: 12.0 (typical default)
- _math_fontfamily: 'dejavusans' (common default)

But since these don't affect `get_family`, I can use simple values.
