[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `transform` to understand what input would produce the output `[[0 1]]`.

1. The `transform` method calls `_transform(X)` after validating the input X.

2. `_transform` calls `self.get_support()` which returns a mask of selected features.

3. `get_support()` calls `self._get_support_mask()` and returns either the mask or indices based on the `indices` parameter (default False).

4. In `_transform`, the mask is used to select columns: `_safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1)`

5. The output is `[[0 1]]` which is a 2D numpy array with shape (1, 2) containing values 0 and 1.

For the output to be `[[0 1]]`:
- X must be a 2D array with 1 row and some number of columns
- The mask must select exactly 2 columns
- After selection, columns should contain [0, 1]

Since the output shape is (1, 2) and contains values [0, 1], the input X likely has:
- 1 row (sample)
- At least 2 columns
- The selected columns (via the mask) are the ones containing 0 and 1

Looking at the `_get_support_mask` - this is abstract and must be implemented by a subclass. For a feature selector, this typically returns a boolean mask indicating which features were selected during fitting.

Given that we need 2 features selected and the output is `[[0 1]]`, the input X could be:
- Shape (1, 2) with values [[0, 1]] and both features selected (mask = [True, True])
- Or shape (1, 3+) with values like [[0, 1, ...]] where only the first 2 columns are selected
- Or other combinations

The simplest case: X = [[0, 1]] with n_features_in_ = 2, scores_ and pvalues_ that result in both features being selected.

For `get_support()` to return [True, True] (selecting both features), we need the scores or selection criteria to select both features.

Let me assume:
- X shape is (1, 2): [[0, 1]]
- n_features_in_ = 2
- Both features are selected (mask is [True, True])
- scores_ could be something like [1.0, 1.0] (or similar values indicating selection)
- pvalues_ could be something like [0.01, 0.01] (low p-values)

The percentile parameter determines how many features are selected. If percentile results in selecting all features, then both would be selected.

Let me set:
- X = [[0, 1]] (numpy array with shape (1, 2))
- n_features_in_ = 2
- percentile = 100 (or any value that selects all features)
- scores_ = [1.0, 1.0]
- pvalues_ = [0.01, 0.01]
