[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce the given output.

The output shows a masked array with:
- data: [1., 2.]
- mask: False
- fill_value: 1e+20

This is a structured/multivariate array with 2 components.

Let me trace through the possible paths:

1. First check: `if isinstance(data, np.ndarray)` - The output is an ndarray, so data could be:
   - A complex array (complex64 or complex128)
   - A structured array with 2 fields
   - Or we could enter the second main condition

2. Looking at the output structure `{"data":[1., 2.], "mask":False, "fill_value": 1e+20}`, this suggests a 1D masked array with 2 float components.

3. The most straightforward path to get this output:
   - Input `data` as a list of 2 arrays: `[np.ma.array([1.]), np.ma.array([2.])]`
   - With `n_components = 2`
   
   This would trigger the second main condition:
   ```python
   if n_components > 1 and len(data) == n_components:
   ```
   
   This path:
   - Creates data as list of masked arrays
   - Creates a structured dtype with 2 float64 fields
   - Creates reconstructed as empty structured array
   - Assigns each component to fields
   - Returns the reconstructed array

4. When you create a structured array with 2 float64 fields and assign [1.] to first field and [2.] to second field, then access it, you get a masked array with data=[1., 2.].

So the input should be:
- data: a list of 2 numpy masked arrays, each containing one element
- n_components: 2

Let me construct: 
- data = [np.ma.array([1.]), np.ma.array([2.])]
- n_components = 2

This should create a structured array and when represented, it would show data=[1., 2.], mask=False, fill_value=1e+20 (default for float).
