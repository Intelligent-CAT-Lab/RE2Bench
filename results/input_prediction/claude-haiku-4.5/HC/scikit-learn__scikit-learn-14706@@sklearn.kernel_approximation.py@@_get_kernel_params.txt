[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_get_kernel_params` method to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

```python
def _get_kernel_params(self):
    params = self.kernel_params
    if params is None:
        params = {}
    if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':
        for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:
            if getattr(self, param) is not None:
                params[param] = getattr(self, param)
    elif self.gamma is not None or self.coef0 is not None or self.degree is not None:
        raise ValueError("Don't pass gamma, coef0 or degree to Nystroem if using a callable or precomputed kernel")
    return params
```

The output is `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`, which means:
1. `params` starts as either None or an empty dict
2. The code must enter the `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':` branch
3. For each param in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`, if `getattr(self, param)` is not None, it gets added to params

For the output to contain `coef0: 0.1` and `degree: 3.1`, we need:
- `self.coef0 = 0.1`
- `self.degree = 3.1`
- `self.kernel` must be a string that is not 'precomputed' and not callable
- `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` must include 'coef0' and 'degree' (and possibly other params)
- Any other params in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` must be None on self, or we'd include them in the output

Common kernels that include 'coef0' and 'degree' are 'poly' (polynomial kernel).

For 'poly', typical KERNEL_PARAMS would include at least ['degree', 'gamma', 'coef0'].

Since only 'coef0' and 'degree' appear in output (not 'gamma'), we need `self.gamma = None`.

For `self.kernel_params`:
- If it's None, params starts as {}
- If it's {}, same effect
- If it's something else, we'd need to account for it, but the simplest is None or {}

Let me set:
- `kernel = 'poly'` (common kernel with coef0 and degree)
- `coef0 = 0.1`
- `degree = 3.1`
- `gamma = None`
- `kernel_params = None` (so params starts empty)
- Other attributes can be their default None values or arbitrary values

The other attributes like `n_components`, `random_state`, and the fitted attributes (`normalization_`, `components_`, `component_indices_`) won't affect this method's output, so I can set them to reasonable defaults.
