Let me trace through the `mul` method to understand what inputs would produce the output `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`.

The `mul` method does:
```python
def mul(self, other):
    coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff
    numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)
    denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)
    numer, denom = numer.normal(denom)
    return Term(coeff, numer, denom)
```

The output is `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`, which means:
- `coeff = 1`
- `numer = Factors({})` (empty factors)
- `denom = Factors({})` (empty factors)

For the result to have these values:
1. `coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff` must equal 1
2. `numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)` after `normal()` must result in `Factors({})`
3. `denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)` after `normal()` must result in `Factors({})`

The simplest case would be if both `self` and `other` are `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`

Let me verify:
- `coeff = 1 * 1 = 1` ✓
- `numer = Factors({}).mul(Factors({})) = Factors({})`
- After `normal(Factors({}), Factors({}))`: both remain `Factors({})` ✓
- `denom = Factors({}).mul(Factors({})) = Factors({})`
- After `normal()`: remains `Factors({})` ✓

So the input should be:
- `self`: `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`
- `other`: `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`

Or more simply, both should be Terms with coefficient 1 and empty factors (numerator and denominator).

Actually, looking at the Term constructor, we can create a Term from a simple commutative expression. The simplest would be `Term(1)` which would decompose to:
- coeff = 1
- numer = Factors({})
- denom = Factors({})

So the input could be two `Term(1)` objects, or we can represent them as the already-constructed terms.

Let me represent them as constructed Term objects to be explicit:
- `self = Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`
- `other = Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`
