[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what inputs would produce this output.

The output shows three items:
1. A numpy array: [0., 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45]
2. A numpy array: [0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95]
3. None/null

So the function returns a tuple with 3 elements. The third element is None, which suggests it was passed as a non-iterable or scalar.

Looking at the function logic:
1. It takes *args as input
2. It checks if the first arg is scalar/string (if so, raises error)
3. It determines `nrecs = len(args[0])` - so the first arg must be a sequence with length 10
4. For each arg, it checks if it's iterable and has length == nrecs
5. It builds masks for finite values and non-masked elements
6. It applies the mask to filter out invalid/masked points
7. Returns the filtered arrays

Given:
- The first array has 10 elements
- The second array has 10 elements
- The third element is None (scalar/non-iterable)

So nrecs = 10.

For the output to have exactly these values with no filtering (they appear as complete unfiltered sequences), the masks must have all True values, meaning:
- All values must be finite
- No masked values

The third element being None in the output means it was passed as None (or some non-iterable scalar).

Let me construct the input:
- args[0]: array of 10 elements [0., 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45]
- args[1]: array of 10 elements [0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95]
- args[2]: None (scalar/non-iterable)

Since seqlist[2] would be False (None is not iterable and has no length), margs[2] remains None unchanged.
Since seqlist[0] and seqlist[1] are True, they go through masking, but if all values are finite and no mask, they remain unchanged.
