[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the input.

The output is:
```
[
    [[0],[0],[1],[0],[1],[0],[1],[0],[1],[1]],
    null
]
```

This represents `(y, expanded_class_weight)` where:
- `y` is the transformed labels: `[[0],[0],[1],[0],[1],[0],[1],[0],[1],[1]]`
- `expanded_class_weight` is `null`

Now let me trace through the function `_validate_y_class_weight`:

1. `check_classification_targets(y)` is called - this validates that y is a classification target
2. `y = np.copy(y)` - y is copied
3. `expanded_class_weight = None` - initialized to None
4. Since `self.class_weight is not None` is false (we need expanded_class_weight to be None in output), then `self.class_weight` must be `None`
5. The function loops through `n_outputs_` and processes each output
6. Since the output y has shape (10, 1) - 10 samples with 1 output each, we have `n_outputs_ = 1`
7. The unique values in y are [0, 1], which are binary (2 classes)
8. Since `self.class_weight is None`, the `if self.class_weight is not None` block is skipped, and `expanded_class_weight` remains `None`

So the input `y` should be binary classification data with 10 samples. The original y before transformation would have values like 0 and 1 (or any two distinct values that map to indices 0 and 1).

Looking at the output `y` values: `[0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1]`, these appear to already be indices. So the input could be the same values or they could have been transformed from other values.

For simplicity and given the output shows binary (0,1), I'll use:
- `y`: an array with 10 samples, binary classification with classes [0, 1]
- `self.class_weight`: None (so expanded_class_weight stays None)
- `n_outputs_`: 1 (single output classification)

The y input needs to result in the given output. Since we see indices [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1], the input y could simply be these same values.

Let me shape it as a 2D array since the code uses `y[:, k]` indexing, suggesting y is 2D with shape (n_samples, n_outputs).
