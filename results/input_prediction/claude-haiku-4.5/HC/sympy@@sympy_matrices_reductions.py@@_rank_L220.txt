[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_rank` function to understand what input would produce an output of 1.

The function returns 1 in these cases:
1. If `M.rows <= 1 or M.cols <= 1` and `False in zeros` (meaning at least one non-zero element exists)
2. If `M.rows == 2 and M.cols == 2`, `False not in zeros and None not in zeros` (all zeros certain), but then determinant is zero and `False in zeros` (contradiction - this path can't give us 1)
3. If `M.rows == 2 and M.cols == 2` and `iszerofunc(d) is False` - this returns 2, not 1

The simplest path to get 1 is through the first condition:
- `M.rows == 1` (or `M.cols == 1`) AND
- `False in zeros` (at least one element is definitively non-zero)

Let me construct a simple 1x1 matrix with one non-zero element. When we check `zeros = [iszerofunc(x) for x in M]`, if M has one element that is non-zero (like 1), then `iszerofunc(1)` returns `None` (since 1 doesn't have `is_zero` attribute or it's None), or actually looking at `_iszero`, it returns `getattr(x, 'is_zero', None)`. For integer 1, this would be None typically.

Wait, let me reconsider. The condition is `if False in zeros`. This means at least one element evaluated by iszerofunc returns False (meaning it's definitely NOT zero).

For a 1x1 matrix with element that has `is_zero = False` attribute, the condition would be satisfied.

Actually, let me look at the structure more carefully. The simplest case is:
- M is a 1x1 matrix (rows=1, cols=1)
- The single element has `is_zero = False` 

Then:
- `M.rows <= 1 or M.cols <= 1` is True
- `zeros = [iszerofunc(x) for x in M]` gives `[False]` (assuming iszerofunc returns False for a non-zero element)
- `False in zeros` is True
- Returns 1

For iszerofunc, the default is `_iszero`. For a symbolic object with `is_zero = False`, this would work.

Let me use a simple non-zero number or a sympy expression that has `is_zero = False`.

A 1x1 matrix with a single element like `1` or any non-zero sympy object would work.

For simplicity, I'll use a Matrix with a single non-zero element. In sympy, this could be represented as a 1x1 matrix.

Looking at the function signature, I need to provide:
- M: A matrix object (likely sympy Matrix)
- iszerofunc: Function to check if element is zero (default _iszero)
- simplify: Boolean or function (default False)

For the simplest case returning 1, I'll create a 1x1 matrix with value 1.

```python
from sympy import Matrix
M = Matrix([[1]])
```

This would have:
- rows = 1, cols = 1
- zeros = [False] (since 1.is_zero = False)
- False in zeros = True
- Returns 1

The iszerofunc should be the default `_iszero` or similar.
simplify should be False (the default).
