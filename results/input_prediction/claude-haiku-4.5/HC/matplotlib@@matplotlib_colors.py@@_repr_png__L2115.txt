[THOUGHT]

Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the input.

The output is a PNG image in binary format (indicated by `b'\x89PNG...'`). Looking at the function `_repr_png_()`:

1. It checks if `self._isinit` is False, then calls `self._init()`
2. Gets `self.lut` (the lookup table)
3. Potentially resizes it to `_BIVAR_REPR_PNG_SIZE` (appears to be 256 based on the code `[:256, :]`)
4. Reverses the first dimension: `pixels[::-1, :, :]`
5. Scales to 0-255: `* 255`
6. Converts to uint8
7. Creates PNG with metadata including the name and version

Looking at the PNG metadata in the output, I can see:
- Title contains "BiCone BivarColormap" 
- The name field should be "BiCone"
- Version is "3.11.0.dev1496+g3323161b8"

From the code flow:
- `_init()` is called which uses `self.patch` to create `self._lut`
- The lut is then retrieved and potentially masked based on shape
- The output PNG is 256x256 (from the IHDR chunk showing `\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00` which is 256x256)

For a BivarColormap (specifically "BiCone"), I need:
- A valid patch (2D array with RGB values that will be resampled to NxN)
- name = "BiCone"
- N = 256 (or could be smaller initially)
- M = 256 (or could be smaller initially)
- _shape must be one of the valid options
- _isinit should be True after initialization
- The other parameters are from __init__

Since this is generating the PNG representation, the object must have been properly initialized with a patch. A BiCone colormap would typically have:
- N and M dimensions (256x256 is standard)
- A specific shape (likely 'square' or 'circle')
- A patch that defines the color mapping

For a minimal working example that produces this output:
- patch: 2D RGB array (small, like 2x2 or similar, will be resampled)
- name: "BiCone"
- N: 256
- M: 256
- _shape: "square" or "circle"
- _isinit: True (or False, will be set by _init())
- The other default values

Given the complexity and that this needs actual valid patch data, the most likely scenario is:
- A small patch array with shape (rows, cols, 3) containing RGB values
- Standard parameters for a BiCone colormap
