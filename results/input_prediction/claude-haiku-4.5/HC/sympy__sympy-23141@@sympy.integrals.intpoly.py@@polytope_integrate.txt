Looking at the `polytope_integrate` function signature and output, I need to determine what inputs would produce the output `"1/8"`.

The function signature is:
```python
def polytope_integrate(poly, expr=None, *, clockwise=False, max_degree=None):
```

The output is the string `"1/8"`, which suggests the result is `Rational(1, 8)` or equivalent.

Let me trace through the function logic:

1. If `expr` is `None` and we're not in the `max_degree` path, the function would raise `TypeError('Input expression must be a valid SymPy expression')`
2. The function returns various results based on the `poly` input type and parameters

For a simple case that returns `1/8`, I need:
- A valid polytope definition
- An expression to integrate
- The result of integration should be `1/8`

A simple example would be integrating over a unit square or similar simple polygon.

Looking at the code flow:
- If `clockwise=False` (default), no reordering happens
- The function then determines if it's a Polygon or uses hyperplane representation
- It calls either `main_integrate` or `main_integrate3d` depending on dimension
- These functions perform the actual integration

For output to be just `1/8` (a single rational number), likely:
- `expr` is a simple expression like `1` (constant)
- `poly` is a simple 2D polygon

Given the structure asks for `clockwise` as a kwarg, and the default is `False`, I should assume `clockwise=False`.

For the expression, if we want output `1/8`, common cases:
- Integrating `1` over a polygon with area `1/8`
- Or integrating `x` or `y` or similar over a unit polygon

A simple unit square `[0,1] × [0,1]` has area 1. Integrating `1` gives 1.
A square `[0, 1/2] × [0, 1/2]` has area `1/4`. Integrating `1` gives `1/4`.
A triangle with vertices at `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(0, 1/4)` has area `1/8`. Integrating `1` gives `1/8`.

Or more simply, integrating `x` over `[0,1]×[0,1]` in 2D would give different results.

The most straightforward case for output `1/8`:
- A simple polygon (triangle or rectangle)
- Integrating the constant `1`
- `clockwise=False` (default)

Let me assume a simple unit triangle that when integrated with constant 1 gives 1/8.

Actually, looking at the output format `{"output": "1/8"}`, this appears to be a string representation. The actual return would be `Rational(1, 8)` which when converted to string becomes `"1/8"`.

For the minimal case:
- `poly`: A simple 2D polygon (could be a Polygon object with appropriate vertices)
- `expr`: `1` or a constant expression
- `clockwise`: `False`

Let me construct a simple example: a triangle with vertices that gives area 1/8 when constant 1 is integrated.

A triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2) has area = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.
