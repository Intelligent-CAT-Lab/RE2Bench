[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `match_submerged_margins` to understand what inputs would produce an output of a list with 2 Axes objects.

1. The function starts by:
   - `axsdone = []` - initializes empty list
   - Loops through `fig.subfigs` and recursively calls itself, accumulating results in `axsdone`
   - Creates `axs` by filtering `fig.get_axes()` where each axis has a subplotspec, is in layout, and not in axsdone

2. For the output to be a list with 2 Axes objects `["<Axes: >", "<Axes: >"]`, the function must return `axs` which contains 2 axes.

3. The function processes axes and may remove some from `axs` if their gridspec is not in `layoutgrids`. So we need:
   - At least 2 axes in `fig.get_axes()`
   - Both should have subplotspecs that are not None
   - Both should have `get_in_layout()` return True
   - Both should not be in `axsdone` (which starts empty if no subfigs)
   - Both their gridspecs should be in `layoutgrids`

4. Since we need to return exactly 2 axes and the function doesn't add or remove axes beyond the initial filtering and the `axs.remove(ax1)` when gridspec not in layoutgrids, we need:
   - Exactly 2 axes that pass all the filtering criteria
   - No subfigs (so axsdone stays empty)
   - Both gridspecs present in layoutgrids

5. Looking at the structure:
   - `layoutgrids` should have keys for the gridspecs of both axes
   - `fig` should be a Figure object with 2 axes that have subplotspecs

Let me construct minimal inputs:
- `fig`: A Figure with 2 axes
- Each axis should have a subplotspec
- Each subplotspec's gridspec should be in layoutgrids
- The figure should have no subfigs
- layoutgrids should contain the gridspecs as keys

For a minimal case with a GridSpec(1, 2):
- 2 axes, one for column 0, one for column 1
- Both have the same gridspec
- The gridspec is in layoutgrids

The output shows `["<Axes: >", "<Axes: >"]` which are 2 Axes objects.
