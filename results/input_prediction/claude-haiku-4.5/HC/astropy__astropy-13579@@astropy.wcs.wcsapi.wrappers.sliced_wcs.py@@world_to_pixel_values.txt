[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `world_to_pixel_values` method to understand what input would produce the given output.

The output shows two very small floating-point numbers close to zero: `-2.9416469260468148e-12` and `-7.123190925995004e-13`.

Looking at the `world_to_pixel_values` method:
1. It calls `_pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))` to get `sliced_out_world_coords`
2. It processes world arrays and calls `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays_new)`
3. It applies offset adjustments if slices have a start value
4. Returns pixel values for the kept dimensions

The output contains two values very close to zero (essentially zero within floating-point precision). This suggests:
- The function is converting world coordinates back to pixel coordinates
- The result is very close to zero, suggesting we're near the origin or that world coordinates correspond to near-zero pixel positions
- Since there are 2 output values, we have `pixel_n_dim == 2`

For the structure:
- `naxis` and `_naxis` should be 2 (two pixel dimensions based on 2 outputs)
- `_pixel_keep` should be something like `[0, 1]` or equivalent to keep 2 dimensions
- `_world_keep` should contain indices indicating which world dimensions are kept
- `_slices_pixel` would contain slice objects or integers for the pixel slicing
- The world input coordinates would need to be such that they map back to near-zero pixel coordinates

The most straightforward case would be:
- Input world coordinates close to the reference world coordinates
- This would map back to pixel coordinates near zero (or near the sliced starting position)

Let me construct a minimal input:
- `naxis = 2` (two dimensions)
- `_pixel_keep = [0, 1]` (keep both pixel dimensions)
- `_world_keep = [0, 1]` (keep both world dimensions)
- `_slices_pixel = [slice(None), slice(None)]` (no slicing, full ranges)
- `_slices_array = None` or similar
- The world_arrays would be something that maps to near-zero when converted back

For args with world coordinates that would result in near-zero pixels, we'd pass world coordinates close to the reference coordinates of the WCS.
