[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output to understand what input was provided to `splitx`.

From the output, we have 3 Bbox objects created:
1. `Bbox([[0.125, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]])`
2. `Bbox([[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]])`
3. `Bbox([[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.9, 0.9]])`

The `splitx` function works as follows:
1. `xf = [0, *args, 1]` - creates a list with 0, the args, and 1
2. `x0, y0, x1, y1 = self.extents` - gets the bbox bounds
3. `w = x1 - x0` - calculates width
4. For each pair of consecutive values in xf, it creates a Bbox with x-coordinates scaled by those values

Since we have 3 output Bboxes, we have 3 pairs from `itertools.pairwise(xf)`.
With 3 pairs, `xf` must have 4 elements: `[0, arg1, arg2, 1]`.

So `args` passed to `splitx` is `(arg1, arg2)` where:
- Looking at the x-coordinates of the output boxes:
  - Box 1: x from 0.125 to 0.78375
  - Box 2: x from 0.78375 to 0.78375 (degenerate)
  - Box 3: x from 0.78375 to 0.9

This means xf = [0, xf1, xf2, 1] where:
- Box 1 uses pair (0, xf1): x0 + 0*w = 0.125, x0 + xf1*w = 0.78375
- Box 2 uses pair (xf1, xf2): x0 + xf1*w = 0.78375, x0 + xf2*w = 0.78375
- Box 3 uses pair (xf2, 1): x0 + xf2*w = 0.78375, x0 + 1*w = 0.9

All boxes have y0 = 0.09999999999999998 and y1 = 0.9, and x1 = 0.9

From Box 3: x0 + 1*w = 0.9, so x1 = 0.9
From Box 1: x0 + 0*w = 0.125, so x0 = 0.125
Therefore: w = 0.9 - 0.125 = 0.775

Now solving for xf1 and xf2:
- From Box 1: x0 + xf1*w = 0.78375 → 0.125 + xf1*0.775 = 0.78375 → xf1*0.775 = 0.65875 → xf1 = 0.85
- From Box 2: x0 + xf2*w = 0.78375 → same as above → xf2 = 0.85

Wait, that would make Box 2 degenerate (same start and end), which matches the output!

So args = (0.85, 0.85)

For `self`, we need `get_points()` to return something that when flattened gives [0.125, 0.09999999999999998, 0.9, 0.9].

The `_points` attribute would be the internal representation. For a Bbox, `_points` is typically a 2x2 array:
`[[x0, y0], [x1, y1]]` = `[[0.125, 0.09999999999999998], [0.9, 0.9]]`

The other attributes like `_parents`, `_invalid`, `_shorthand_name`, `_minpos`, `_ignore`, `_points_orig` are typically default/empty for a standard Bbox object.
