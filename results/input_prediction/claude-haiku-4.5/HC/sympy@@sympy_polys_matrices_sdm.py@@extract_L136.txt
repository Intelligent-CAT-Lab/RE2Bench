[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and work backwards through the `extract` method.

The output is:
```
{
    "0": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "1": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "2": {
        "0": 1
    }
}
```

This is a sparse dictionary matrix (SDM) with 3 rows and 1 column, where all elements are 1.

Looking at the `extract` method:
1. It takes rows and cols as parameters
2. It creates rowmap and colmap to map original indices to new indices
3. It iterates through the intersection of rowset and sdm1.keys()
4. For each element in the result, it creates new row entries

The output shows the result has shape (3, 1) since there are rows 0, 1, 2 and each has column 0.

For the output to have exactly these rows (0, 1, 2) and column (0), the `rows` parameter passed to extract must have been a sequence with 3 elements that maps to rows 0, 1, 2 of the original matrix, and `cols` must map to column 0.

The simplest case would be:
- rows = [0, 1, 2] (or some equivalent indexing that results in these 3 rows)
- cols = [0] (selecting the first column)

For this to work with the modulo arithmetic in the code:
- `i1 % m` where i1 is the original row index
- `j1 % n` where j1 is the original column index

The self (SDM object) needs to:
1. Have shape such that it contains at least rows 0, 1, 2 and column 0
2. Have all these positions populated with value 1
3. Have a domain (let's assume a simple numeric domain like integers or rationals)

The minimum shape would be (3, 1) or larger. Let me assume (3, 1) with all elements being 1.

So the input should be:
- self._elemsdict (the sparse dict): {0: {0: 1}, 1: {0: 1}, 2: {0: 1}}
- self.shape: (3, 1)
- self.rows: 3
- self.cols: 1
- self.domain: Some domain object (let's use a generic placeholder)
- rows: [0, 1, 2]
- cols: [0]

Actually, looking more carefully at the output format - the keys are strings "0", "1", "2", which suggests this might be how it's being serialized to JSON. In the actual SDM, these would be integers.

Let me reconsider: the output dictionary shows keys as strings in JSON format. The actual SDM would have integer keys.

So for self, the elemsdict should be:
```python
{
    0: {0: 1},
    1: {0: 1},
    2: {0: 1}
}
```

And the parameters:
- rows = [0, 1, 2]
- cols = [0]

This would extract all 3 rows and the first column, resulting in the output shown.
