[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `radsimp` function to understand what input would produce the output `"1/(a - b)"`.

The function `radsimp` takes an expression and simplifies it, particularly handling radicals. The output is `"1/(a - b)"`, which is a simple rational expression with no radicals.

Let me work backwards:
1. The output is `1/(a - b)`, which suggests the input might have been something like `1/(a - b)` already, or perhaps something with radicals that simplified to this.

2. Looking at the structure of `radsimp`:
   - It extracts `coeff` and `expr` from the input using `as_coeff_Add()`
   - It normalizes `expr`
   - It calls `handle(expr)` on the expression
   - Finally it returns `coeff + _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d)`

3. For the output to be exactly `1/(a - b)`:
   - `coeff` should be `0` (or `S.Zero`)
   - The fraction `n/d` should simplify to `1/(a - b)`
   - This means `n = 1` and `d = a - b`

4. The simplest input that would produce this would be an expression that is already `1/(a - b)` or something that naturally simplifies to it.

5. Since the function handles radicals and the output has no radicals, a straightforward input like `1/(a - b)` would work.

6. With default parameters: `symbolic=True, max_terms=4`

7. The input expression could simply be `1/(a - b)` or equivalently `(a - b)**(-1)` in sympy notation.

A simple choice would be to use `1/(a - b)` as the input expression.
