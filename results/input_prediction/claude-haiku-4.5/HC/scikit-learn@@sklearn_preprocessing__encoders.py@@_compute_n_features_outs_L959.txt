Let me trace through the `_compute_n_features_outs` method step by step:

1. The output is `[2]`, which is a list with a single element of value 2.

2. Looking at the first line:
   ```python
   output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]
   ```
   This creates a list where each element is the length of a category array. Since the output is `[2]`, this means `self.categories_` must be a list/array with one element (one feature), and that element has length 2.

3. So `self.categories_` should be something like `[[val1, val2]]` or similar structure where the first (and only) category has 2 elements.

4. Then we check:
   ```python
   if self._drop_idx_after_grouping is not None:
       for i, drop_idx in enumerate(self._drop_idx_after_grouping):
           if drop_idx is not None:
               output[i] -= 1
   ```
   Since the final output is `[2]`, and we didn't subtract anything, either:
   - `self._drop_idx_after_grouping is None`, OR
   - All elements in `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` are None

5. Then we check:
   ```python
   if not self._infrequent_enabled:
       return output
   ```
   Since we got to the final return with `[2]`, either:
   - `self._infrequent_enabled is False` (so we return early), OR
   - `self._infrequent_enabled is True` but the infrequent indices loop doesn't modify the output

6. The simplest case is when `self._infrequent_enabled is False`, which causes an early return.

So for the input:
- `self.categories_` should be `[[a, b]]` (or any array with 1 category of size 2)
- `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` should be `None` or `[None]`
- `self._infrequent_enabled` should be `False`
- Other fields can have reasonable defaults
