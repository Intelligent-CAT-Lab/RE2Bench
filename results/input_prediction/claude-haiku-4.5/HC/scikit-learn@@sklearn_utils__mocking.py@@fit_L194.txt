Let me analyze the output and trace through the `fit` method to determine what inputs would produce this output.

The output is: `CheckingClassifier(expected_sample_weight=True)`

This is the string representation of a CheckingClassifier instance after `fit()` has been called. The `fit()` method returns `self`, so the output is just showing the state of the classifier.

Key observations:
1. The output shows `expected_sample_weight=True`, meaning this parameter was set during initialization
2. The `fit()` method checks conditions and returns `self`
3. For the fit to complete successfully without raising exceptions, certain conditions must be met

Looking at the `fit()` method logic:
- `assert _num_samples(X) == _num_samples(y)` - X and y must have same number of samples
- If `self.expected_sample_weight` is True, the code checks: `if sample_weight is None: raise AssertionError('Expected sample_weight to be passed')`
- So if `expected_sample_weight=True`, we must pass a `sample_weight` parameter

Since we need:
1. `expected_sample_weight=True` in the initialization
2. The fit to complete successfully
3. X and y to have matching number of samples
4. sample_weight to be passed (not None)

Let me construct minimal inputs:
- X: A simple array with n samples
- y: A corresponding array with same n samples
- sample_weight: A corresponding weight array with same n samples
- All other parameters: defaults (None or defaults from __init__)

The simplest case would be:
- X: [[1, 2]] (1 sample, 2 features)
- y: [0] (1 sample)
- sample_weight: [1.0] (1 sample, 1 weight)
- expected_sample_weight: True
- All others: None or default values
