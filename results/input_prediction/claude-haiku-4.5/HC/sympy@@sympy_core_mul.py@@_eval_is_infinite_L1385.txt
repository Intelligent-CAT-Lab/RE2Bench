[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the logic of `_eval_is_infinite`:

```python
def _eval_is_infinite(self):
    seen_zero, seen_infinite = self._eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()
    if seen_infinite is True and seen_zero is False:
        return True
    elif seen_infinite is False:
        return False
    else:
        return None
```

The output is `false`, which means the function returned `False`.

Looking at the conditions:
1. `if seen_infinite is True and seen_zero is False:` returns `True` - this is not our case
2. `elif seen_infinite is False:` returns `False` - **this is our case**
3. `else:` returns `None` - this is not our case

So for the output to be `False`, we need `seen_infinite is False`.

This means `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()` must return a tuple where the second element (seen_infinite) is `False`.

Looking at `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()`:
- It initializes `seen_zero = seen_infinite = False`
- For each argument `a` in `self.args`:
  - If `a.is_zero` is True, it checks if `seen_infinite is not False` and returns `(None, None)` early if so, otherwise sets `seen_zero = True`
  - Elif `a.is_infinite` is True, it checks if `seen_zero is not False` and returns `(None, None)` early if so, otherwise sets `seen_infinite = True`
  - Else (when `a.is_zero` and `a.is_infinite` are both not True):
    - If `seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None`, it checks conditions and possibly sets `seen_zero = None`
    - If `seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None`, it checks conditions and possibly sets `seen_infinite = None`
- Returns `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)`

For `seen_infinite` to remain `False` at the end:
- We need to never encounter an argument where `a.is_infinite is True`
- And we need to never encounter a situation where `seen_infinite` gets set to `None`

The simplest case is when all arguments have `is_infinite = False` (or when there are no arguments, or when all args have both `is_zero` and `is_infinite` as `False`).

For example:
- A `Mul` with no arguments (identity element)
- A `Mul` with arguments that all have `is_infinite = False`

Let me create a simple case: A `Mul` object with arguments where all have `is_infinite = False` and `is_zero = False`.

For instance, a simple integer or constant like `Mul(2, 3)` would work, where both 2 and 3 have `is_infinite = False` and `is_zero = False`.

Actually, the simplest would be to have `self.args` be something like `(Integer(2), Integer(3))` where both integers have `is_infinite = False`.
