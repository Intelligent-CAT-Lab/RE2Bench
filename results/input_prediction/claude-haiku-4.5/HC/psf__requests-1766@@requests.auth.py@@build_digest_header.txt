[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the inputs to `build_digest_header`.

From the output, I can extract:
- username="user"
- realm="me@kennethreitz.com"
- nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
- uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"
- response="d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460"
- opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"
- algorithm="MD5"
- qop="auth"
- nc=00000001
- cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"

Now let me trace through the code:

1. The username comes from `self.username`, so `self.username = "user"`
2. The password comes from `self.password`, so `self.password = "pass"`
3. The realm, nonce, qop, opaque, algorithm come from `self.chal` dictionary
4. The uri comes from parsing the url parameter (the path part)
5. The method parameter is used to build A2
6. The nc value is "00000001", which means `self.nonce_count` was 1 after incrementing
7. Since nc=00000001 (first occurrence), and the code increments nonce_count only if nonce == self.last_nonce, this means `self.last_nonce` was different from the current nonce (or empty initially)

From nc=00000001, we know that nonce_count became 1 in this call. The code shows:
```python
if nonce == self.last_nonce:
    self.nonce_count += 1
else:
    self.nonce_count = 1
```

So if nc=00000001, then either:
- This is the first call (last_nonce was '') and nonce_count was set to 1
- Or the nonce changed from last_nonce

Given the context, this is likely a first or fresh authentication, so `self.last_nonce` should be empty string or different from current nonce. Let me assume it's a fresh state: `self.last_nonce = ""`

The uri is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", so the url parameter must parse to this path.
The method must be "GET" (typical default for digest auth).

Let me verify the algorithm is "MD5" - yes, it's in the output.

So the inputs should be:
- self.username = "user"
- self.password = "pass"
- self.last_nonce = "" (empty, fresh state before this call)
- self.nonce_count = 0 (before increment, it becomes 1)
- self.chal contains all the digest challenge parameters
- method = "GET" (typical)
- url = "http://me@kennethreitz.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (or similar with proper domain)
- pos = None or some value
- num_401_calls is not used in build_digest_header, could be any value
