[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `switch_backend` function to understand what input would produce a `null` output.

The function signature is `def switch_backend(newbackend: str) -> None:`, which means it returns `None` (null in JSON).

Looking at the function:
1. It starts by checking if `newbackend is rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel`
2. If not, it continues with loading the backend module
3. The function modifies global state and rcParams but returns `None` at the end (implicitly)

Since the output is `null`, and the function always returns `None` (either implicitly at the end or through early returns), any valid input string would produce this output.

Looking at the logic:
- If `newbackend is rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel`, it tries various candidates and recursively calls `switch_backend`
- Otherwise, it loads the backend module and performs setup

For a straightforward execution that returns `None`, we need a valid backend string. Common backends include:
- 'agg'
- 'tkagg'
- 'qt5agg'
- etc.

The simplest case would be passing a valid backend name like 'agg', which is used as a fallback in the code. Looking at the code, 'agg' is used as the default fallback backend, so passing 'agg' as the input would be a reasonable choice.

Actually, any valid backend string would work since the function always returns `None`. Let me use 'agg' as it's mentioned in the code as a fallback option.
