[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the input to `_fit`.

The output shows:
```
RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1)
```

This tells us:
1. `self.estimator` = SVC(kernel='linear')
2. `self.n_features_to_select` = 4
3. `self.step` = 0.1
4. The other parameters (importance_getter, verbose) use defaults

For the `_fit` method:
- It takes X, y, and optional step_score
- The method validates X and y using `validate_data`
- The method processes features and performs recursive feature elimination
- The method returns self

Looking at the code flow:
- `n_features_to_select = 4` (given as integer)
- `step = 0.1` (float between 0 and 1, so: `int(max(1, 0.1 * n_features))`)
- The algorithm needs to eliminate features until only 4 remain
- For this to work, we need enough features to start with

Since the output is just the RFE object representation after fitting, and we need to determine what input would produce this state:

1. `self.estimator` = SVC(kernel='linear')
2. `self.n_features_to_select` = 4
3. `self.step` = 0.1
4. `self.importance_getter` = 'auto' (default)
5. `self.verbose` = 0 (default)

For X and y:
- They must be valid array-like objects
- X should have at least 2 features (from ensure_min_features=2)
- We need enough features so that after RFE, we're left with 4
- A reasonable number would be something like 20 features to make sense of the step=0.1 parameter

For step_score:
- This is optional and used during the recursive elimination
- The output doesn't show step_n_features_, step_scores_, etc., which suggests step_score=None

So the minimal inputs would be:
- X: some array with shape (n_samples, n_features) where n_features >= 4
- y: corresponding target values
- step_score: None (not provided, uses default behavior)
