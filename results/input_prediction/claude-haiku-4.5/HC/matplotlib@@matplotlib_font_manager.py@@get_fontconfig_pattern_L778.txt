[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the input state of the FontProperties object.

The output is: "Noto Sans CJK SC:style=normal:variant=normal:weight=normal:stretch=normal:size=12.0"

Looking at the `generate_fontconfig_pattern` function:
1. It extracts family names and escapes them, joining with commas
2. It then appends key=value pairs for: style, variant, weight, stretch, file, size (skipping None values)

From the output string, I can deduce:
- Family: "Noto Sans CJK SC" (the part before the first colon)
- style: "normal"
- variant: "normal"
- weight: "normal"
- stretch: "normal"
- file: None (not in output, so it must be None)
- size: 12.0

Now I need to map these to the FontProperties object attributes:
- `_family`: should be a list containing "Noto Sans CJK SC" (since `set_family` converts strings to lists)
- `_slant`: "normal" (this is set by `set_style`, stored as `_slant`)
- `_variant`: "normal"
- `_weight`: "normal" (valid weight string from weight_dict)
- `_stretch`: "normal" (valid stretch string from stretch_dict)
- `_file`: None
- `_size`: 12.0
- `_math_fontfamily`: This would be set to some default, but since it's not in the fontconfig pattern output, it's not queried. I'll set it to a reasonable default like "dejavu"
