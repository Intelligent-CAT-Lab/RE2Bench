[THOUGHT]
1. The output is "2500/pi", which is a symbolic expression representing 2500 divided by π.

2. Looking at the `sympify` function, it tries to convert various input types into SymPy expressions. The function returns a parsed expression.

3. For the output to be "2500/pi", the input `a` must be a string that can be parsed into this expression. The most straightforward input would be the string "2500/pi".

4. Looking at the code flow:
   - First it checks if `a` has `__sympy__` attribute (it won't for a string)
   - Checks if it's a CantSympify instance (it won't be)
   - Tries to find converters for the class (strings won't have a direct converter)
   - Since it's a string, it goes to the parsing section at the end
   - It calls `parse_expr(a, ...)` with transformations
   - This parses "2500/pi" into the symbolic expression

5. For `strict`, the default value would be `False` based on the function signature. Since the input is a string and gets parsed successfully, and there's no indication that strict mode is required, `strict=False` would be appropriate. However, the structure shows `strict` as a kwarg, so I need to provide a value. Looking at the function signature, `strict=False` is the default.

6. The input string "2500/pi" would be parsed by `parse_expr` which recognizes the division operator and the symbol `pi`, creating the expression 2500/π.
