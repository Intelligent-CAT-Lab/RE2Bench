[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_eval_pos_neg` method to understand what inputs would produce `null` (None) as output.

The method returns `None` (implicitly) in several cases:
1. When `t.is_zero` is True but not all `a.is_finite for a in self.args` (the inner condition fails, so it just returns without explicit return value)
2. When `t.is_extended_nonpositive` and `saw_NOT` is already True
3. When `t.is_extended_nonnegative` and `saw_NOT` is already True
4. When `t.is_positive is False` and `saw_NOT` is already True
5. When `t.is_negative is False` and `saw_NOT` is already True
6. In the final `else` block when none of the conditions match

Looking at the structure, I need to provide a `self` object that is a `Mul` instance.

For the output to be `None`, the simplest path is to have an argument that doesn't match any of the specific conditions and falls through to the final `else: return` statement.

Or more likely, we hit one of the early returns that returns `None`.

Let me think about a simple case: if we have a `Mul` with args that include something that doesn't have definite is_extended_positive, is_extended_negative, is_zero, is_extended_nonpositive, is_extended_nonnegative, is_positive, or is_negative properties set - it would fall through to the `else: return` which returns `None`.

The simplest approach: create a Mul instance with an argument that has ambiguous sign properties, and pass `sign=1` (or any value).

For example, a symbol with no assumptions would have:
- is_extended_positive: None
- is_extended_negative: None
- is_zero: None
- is_extended_nonpositive: None
- is_extended_nonnegative: None
- is_positive: None
- is_negative: None

This would hit the final `else: return` and return `None`.

So I need:
- `self`: a Mul instance with args that include a symbol or expression with unknown sign
- `sign`: any integer value (typically 1 or -1)

Since the structure just asks for `self` and `sign`, I'll construct a Mul expression with a symbol.
