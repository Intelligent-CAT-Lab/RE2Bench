[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step.

1. The function `add_attrs_init` is a method of `_ClassBuilder` that returns `self` (as seen in the code: `return self`).

2. The output shows `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>"`, which indicates that when the `_ClassBuilder` object is converted to a string (likely via `__repr__`), it shows `cls=A`. This means the class name is `A`.

3. Looking at the `__init__` method of `_ClassBuilder`, it takes parameters:
   - `cls`: the class being processed
   - `these`: the attributes (could be None or a collection)
   - `auto_attribs`: boolean for automatic attribute detection
   - `props`: ClassProps object
   - `has_custom_setattr`: boolean

4. The `add_attrs_init` method itself takes no additional parameters (only `self`), so `args` and `kwargs` would be empty dictionaries.

5. For the output to show `cls=A`, the `_ClassBuilder` must have been initialized with a class named `A`.

6. Since we're looking at what inputs would produce this output, and `add_attrs_init` returns `self`, the key information is that the `_ClassBuilder` was created with:
   - A class `A` (so `cls` parameter to `__init__`)
   - Some `these` value (could be None, empty, or a collection)
   - Some `auto_attribs` value
   - Some `has_custom_setattr` value

7. Since we only need to fill in the `self` structure with the relevant attributes that would be visible, and the output shows it's a `_ClassBuilder(cls=A)`, the minimal required input would be setting up the class `A`.

8. Looking at the structure provided, it asks for `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr` in the `self` object. These are parameters passed to `__init__`.

9. A reasonable set of default/minimal values would be:
   - `auto_attribs`: False (common default)
   - `these`: None (no explicit attributes list)
   - `has_custom_setattr`: False (no custom setattr)
