[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `_repr_html_` function to understand what input would produce the given output.

The `_repr_html_` method:
1. Calls `self._repr_png_()` to get PNG bytes
2. Encodes them to base64
3. Creates HTML with the colormap name, PNG image, and color blocks for "outside" and "bad" colors
4. Returns an HTML string

From the output, I can extract:
- The colormap name is "BiCone" (appears in `<strong>BiCone</strong>`)
- The shape appears to be related to how the colormap is rendered
- The outside color is `#ff00ffff` (magenta with full alpha)
- The bad color is `#00000000` (black with zero alpha)
- The name in the PNG metadata also says "BiCone BivarColormap"

Looking at the initialization parameters in `__init__`:
- `self.name = name` → should be "BiCone"
- `self.N = int(N)` → default is 256
- `self.M = int(M)` → default is 256
- `self._shape = shape` → validated against ['square', 'circle', 'ignore', 'circleignore']
- `self._rgba_bad = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` → (0, 0, 0, 0) which is black transparent
- `self._rgba_outside = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)` → (1, 0, 1, 1) which is magenta fully opaque
- `self._isinit` → should be False initially, but the method calls `self._init()` if not initialized
- `self.n_variates = 2` → always 2
- `self._origin = (float(origin[0]), float(origin[1]))` → default (0, 0)

Since `_repr_html_` is being called, and the function checks `if not self._isinit: self._init()`, the object must have been initialized (otherwise it would call an abstract method).

So `_isinit` should be `True` after initialization.

The standard defaults would be:
- N = 256
- M = 256
- shape = 'square' (first in the list, or a default)
- _rgba_bad = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- _rgba_outside = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- name = "BiCone"
- _isinit = True (since the method already executed)
- n_variates = 2
- _origin = (0.0, 0.0)

The "patch" field is not shown in the provided code, so it might be None or some default value. Looking at typical matplotlib colormaps, this might not be set.
