The function `_compute_missing_values_in_feature_mask` is essentially determining if there are missing values (NaNs) in the input `X` that need to be tracked, or if `X` is clean/unsupported.

The logic flow is:
1. `_support_missing_values(X)` is checked. This depends on `issparse(X)`, `allow_nan` tag, and `monotonic_cst`.
2. If distinct missing values are not supported (returns `False`), `assert_all_finite(X)` is called. If `X` contains NaNs or Infs, this raises a `ValueError`. If `X` is finite, it returns `None`.
3. If missing values are supported (returns `True`), it sums `X`. If `overall_sum` is finite (not NaN), it means there are no missing values in `X`, and it returns `None`.
4. If there is a NaN sum, it calculates the mask.

The provided output is `null` (None). This implies that either:
- Missing values are not supported, and `X` is finite.
- Missing values are supported, but `X` has no missing values.

In both valid execution paths resulting in `None`, `X` must be finite (contain no NaNs or Infs). If `X` contained NaNs while unsupported, it would crash. If it contained NaNs while supported, it would return a mask (not None).

Therefore, we need to construct an input `X` that is a simple array of finite numbers. `[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]` is a suitable candidate. The `n_features_in_` attribute in `self` should match the number of columns in `X` (which is 2). The other attributes of `self` can be filled with standard default values for a Decision Tree estimator.
