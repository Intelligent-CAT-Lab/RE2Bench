To predict the input, we analyze the execution path and the provided output `{"score": -Infinity}`.

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is a dictionary with a single key `"score"` and value `-Infinity`. The `_MultimetricScorer.__call__` method constructs this dictionary by iterating over `self._scorers`.
    *   This implies `self._scorers` is a dictionary containing the key `"score"`.
    *   The value associated with `"score"` in the output is `-Infinity`.

2.  **Analyze the Execution Trace**:
    *   The trace shows a call to `scikit-learn.sklearn.metrics._scorer.__call__`. This method is defined as `def __call__(self, estimator, *args, **kwargs): return estimator.score(*args, **kwargs)`. This strongly suggests that the scorer object used is an instance of `_PassthroughScorer` (or a similar internal scorer wrapper) which simply calls the `score` method of the estimator.
    *   Since the scorer calls `estimator.score` and the result is `-Infinity`, the `estimator` object's `score` method must return `-Infinity`.

3.  **Determine Input Variables**:
    *   **`_scorers`**: Must be a dictionary `{'score': <scorer_object>}`. In the JSON representation for complex objects (like the scorer instance), we use `{}` as a placeholder/mock representation (consistent with `_trace: {}` in the example).
    *   **`_raise_exc`**: The default is `True`. Since the return value is a float (and not an exception traceback string), no exception catching logic was triggered to change the output format. We set this to `True`.
    *   **`estimator`**: This is the object passed to `__call__`. It needs to be an object (mock) that behaves as described. We represent it as `{}`.
    *   **`args`** (the `*args` passed to `__call__`): These are usually `(X, y)`. Since the `estimator.score` returns a constant `-Infinity` regardless of input in this scenario (based on the fixed output), and we represent data/mocks generically, we can use an empty list `[]` or `[null, null]`. An empty list `[]` is the minimal valid representation for `*args`.
