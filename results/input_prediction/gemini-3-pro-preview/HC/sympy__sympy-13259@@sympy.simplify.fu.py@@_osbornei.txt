To determine the input for `_osbornei(e, d)` that yields output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)`, we reverse the transformation logic.

The function `_osbornei` traverses the expression `e`. For every trigonometric function found, it separates the argument into two parts relative to the dummy variable `d`: a dependent part `X` (containing `d`) and an independent part `const` (not containing `d`).
The new argument `a` for the hyperbolic function is calculated as:
`a = X.replace(d, 1) + const * I`.

The output is `-I * tanh(x + I*z)`, which equals `tanh(x + I*z) / I` (since `1/I = -I`).
Code logic for `tan(arg)`: `return tanh(a) / I`.
Thus, `a` corresponds to `x + I*z`.
So, `X.replace(d, 1) + const * I = x + I*z`.

By equating real (non-I factor) and imaginary (I factor) parts (conceptually):
1. `const * I = I * z` implies `const = z`.
2. `X.replace(d, 1) = x`. A simple expression `X` satisfying this is `x * d`.

So the original argument to `tan` was `X + const = x * d + z`.
The input expression `e` is `tan(x*d + z)`.
The variable `d` passed to `_osbornei` must be the symbol `d`.
The variables `x` and `z` are treated as symbolic constants relative to `d`.

Therefore:
`e = "tan(d*x + z)"`
`d = "d"`
