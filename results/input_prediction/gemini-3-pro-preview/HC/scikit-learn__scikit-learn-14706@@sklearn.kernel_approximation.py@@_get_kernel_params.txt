The function `_get_kernel_params` constructs a dictionary of parameters to be passed to a kernel function.
1. It initializes `params` with `self.kernel_params`. Since the output `{ "coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1 }` contains only specific scalar values associated with kernel definitions, it is safe to assume `self.kernel_params` is `None` (or empty).
2. It checks if `self.kernel` is a string (not callable and not 'precomputed').
3. It iterates over parameter names found in the global dictionary `KERNEL_PARAMS` for the specific `self.kernel`.
4. The output contains `coef0` and `degree`. In standard Scikit-learn (which this code is from), the polynomial kernel (`'poly'`) utilizes `gamma`, `degree`, and `coef0`. The presence of `degree` strongly suggests `self.kernel` is `'poly'`.
5. The code checks `if getattr(self, param) is not None`.
6. For `coef0` to appear in the output with value `0.1`, `self.coef0` must be `0.1`.
7. For `degree` to appear in the output with value `3.1`, `self.degree` must be `3.1`.
8. `gamma` is notably absent from the output. For the `'poly'` kernel, `gamma` is usually a parameter. Its absence implies `self.gamma` is `None`.
9. The other attributes (`n_components`, `random_state`, etc.) are not accessed by `_get_kernel_params` or do not affect the logic flow for this specific path. They can be set to their `__init__` defaults (`100`, `None`) or `null` for fitted attributes.

Therefore:
- `self.kernel` = "poly"
- `self.coef0` = 0.1
- `self.degree` = 3.1
- `self.gamma` = None
