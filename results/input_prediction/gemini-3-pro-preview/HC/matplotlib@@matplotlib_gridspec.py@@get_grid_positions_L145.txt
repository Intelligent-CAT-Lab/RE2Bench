[THOUGHT]
The goal is to determine the input state of a `GridSpecBase` object and the arguments passed to `get_grid_positions` such that the output matches the provided JSON.

The function `get_grid_positions` returns a tuple: `(fig_bottoms, fig_tops, fig_lefts, fig_rights)`.
The output JSON shows this tuple containing four elements:
1. `"[0.1]"` corresponding to `fig_bottoms`
2. `"[0.9]"` corresponding to `fig_tops`
3. `"[0.125]"` corresponding to `fig_lefts`
4. `"[0.9]"` corresponding to `fig_rights`

Since each of these arrays has a length of 1 (containing one number), this implies that the grid dimensions are 1x1. Thus:
`_nrows` = 1
`_ncols` = 1

For a grid of size 1x1, the calculations simplify significantly:
- `cell_h` becomes the total height (`top - bottom`) because the divider space term `hspace * (nrows - 1)` is 0.
- `fig_bottoms` will simply contain `[bottom]`.
- `fig_tops` will simply contain `[top]`.
- Similarly, `fig_lefts` will contain `[left]`.
- `fig_rights` will contain `[right]`.

Mapping the output values to these variables:
- `fig_bottoms` = `[0.1]` implies `bottom` = 0.1
- `fig_tops` = `[0.9]` implies `top` = 0.9
- `fig_lefts` = `[0.125]` implies `left` = 0.125
- `fig_rights` = `[0.9]` implies `right` = 0.9

These values (0.125, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) correspond exactly to the default subplot parameters in Matplotlib (`left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top`).

The variables `wspace` and `hspace` are used in the calculation of `sep_h` and `sep_w`. For a 1x1 grid, these separators are multiplied by `0` (since `nrows-1` is 0) or result in empty separator arrays, so their specific values do not affect the output. However, they must be numeric values to safely participate in arithmetic operations within the function. The standard Matplotlib default for both is `0.2`.

The values for `_row_height_ratios` and `_col_width_ratios` default to lists of `1`s. For a 1x1 grid, the normalization logic ensures the single cell takes up the full available width/height regardless of the specific ratio value, provided it is non-zero. The standard default `[1]` is the correct prediction.

We assume `figure` and `fig` are `None` as they are not strictly required for the logic when the parameters are already supplied via the simulated `self` properties (as implied by the `[STRUCTURE]` which simulates the return of `get_subplot_params` via `self` attributes).

Therefore, the input state is constructed with `nrows=1`, `ncols=1`, standard ratio lists, and the coordinate bounds derived directly from the output.
