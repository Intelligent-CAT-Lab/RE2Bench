The function `_expand_partial_derivative` is being called on a `PartialDerivative` object (represented by `self`). The output of this function call is `S.Zero` (implied by the null fields in the output JSON, as `S.Zero` does not have tensor attributes like `_indices`).

Looking at the code for `_expand_partial_derivative`:
```python
def _expand_partial_derivative(self):
    args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
    obj = self.func(*args)
    # ... attributes setting ...
    result = obj
    if not args[0].free_symbols:
        return S.Zero
    # ...
```
The method returns `S.Zero` if `args[0]` (which corresponds to the expression being differentiated) has no free symbols. This implies the expression is a constant (e.g., a number like `1` or `0`) with respect to differentiation.

A `PartialDerivative` of a scalar constant (rank 0 tensor) with respect to a variable has no free indices.
1.  **`_indices`**: Since the expression is a scalar, the resultant tensor (the PartialDerivative object itself) has no external indices. Thus, `_indices` should be an empty list `[]`.
2.  **`_free`**: Similarly, there are no free indices in the structure. `_free` should be `[]`.
3.  **`_dum`**: There are no dummy (contracted) indices introduced or present in a simple partial derivative of a scalar constant. `_dum` should be `[]`.

The `args` and `kwargs` keys in the structure correspond to the arguments of `_expand_partial_derivative`. This method takes no arguments (besides `self`), so `args` and `kwargs` remain empty dictionaries as provided in the structure.
