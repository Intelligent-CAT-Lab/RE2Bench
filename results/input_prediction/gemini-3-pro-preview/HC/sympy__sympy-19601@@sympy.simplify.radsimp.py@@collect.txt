To predict the input for the function `collect` that results in the output `_Dummy_373`, we analyze the function and the output:

1.  **Output Analysis**: The output is `_Dummy_373`. This is the string representation of a SymPy symbol or dummy variable. Since `collect` is a symbolic manipulation function, it returns a SymPy expression (when `evaluate` is True) or a dictionary (when `evaluate` is False). The result is a simple string, which implies `evaluate=True` (or defaulted to True) was used, returning a single expression rather than a dictionary.

2.  **Expression (`expr`)**: The output is exactly `_Dummy_373`. The function `collect` gathers terms with respect to symbols. If `expr` is simply the symbol `_Dummy_373`, and we collect on it (or on anything else), the result will be `_Dummy_373`. To guarantee this specific name (including the ID 373), the input expression must be a Symbol or Dummy with that name. Since we are simulating the input via strings/JSON, passing the string `"_Dummy_373"` will be sympified to `Symbol('_Dummy_373')`, which renders as `_Dummy_373`.

3.  **Symbols (`syms`)**: We need a list of symbols to collect on. Collecting the expression `_Dummy_373` with respect to itself (`["_Dummy_373"]`) is a standard operation (grouping terms of that variable) and yields the expression itself. Collecting with respect to an unrelated variable also yields the expression itself. We will assume the most direct input where the target symbol matches the expression variable.

4.  **Other Arguments**:
    *   `func`: Defaults to `None`. No transformation is implied by the output.
    *   `evaluate`: Must be `True` to return the expression directly instead of a dictionary (which would look like `{...}`).
    *   `exact`: default `False`.
    *   `distribute_order_term`: default `True`.
