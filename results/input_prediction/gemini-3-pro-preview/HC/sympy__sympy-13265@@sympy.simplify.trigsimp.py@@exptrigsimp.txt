To predict the input `expr` for the function `exptrigsimp` that results in an output serialized as `{"nargs": {"_elements": "frozenset({1})" }}`, we analyze the output format and the function's behavior.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output JSON contains `"_elements": "frozenset({1})"`. In SymPy, the `FiniteSet` class uses an `_elements` attribute to store its members as a Python `frozenset`. A `FiniteSet` containing the single integer `1` would have `_elements` equal to `frozenset({1})`. Thus, the return value of the function is `FiniteSet(1)`.

2.  **Analyze the Function `exptrigsimp`:** This function simplifies exponential and trigonometric expressions. It uses `bottom_up` traversal to apply simplifications recursively.
    *   `bottom_up` traverses the expression tree. For a container like `FiniteSet`, it iterates over its arguments (the elements of the set).
    *   The core logic `exp_trig` attempts to rewrite expressions in terms of `exp` or `cos` and keeps the simplest one.
    *   The function `f` simplifies products of exponentials.
    *   There are checks for `HyperbolicFunction` and `TrigonometricFunction` to apply `TR2i` (trigonometric simplification).

3.  **Determine the Input:**
    *   Since `exptrigsimp` returns `FiniteSet(1)`, the input must be an expression that simplifies to this set.
    *   The simplest input that produces `FiniteSet(1)` is `FiniteSet(1)` itself.
    *   Let's trace `exptrigsimp(FiniteSet(1))`:
        *   `bottom_up` visits the argument `1`. `exp_trig(1)` returns `1` (since it has no trig/exp functions, rewrites do nothing effective).
        *   The traversal reconstructs `FiniteSet(1)`.
        *   Then `exp_trig` is applied to `FiniteSet(1)`. `FiniteSet` is not a trig function, so `rewrite` calls usually don't change it or aren't applicable in a way that reduces op count significantly vs strictly keeping it. It remains `FiniteSet(1)`.
        *   The function `f` checks if it's a `Mul`. It is not.
        *   The checks for `has(HyperbolicFunction)` and `has(TrigonometricFunction)` are False for `FiniteSet(1)`.
        *   The function returns `FiniteSet(1)`.
    *   This matches the output perfectly. It is a standard test case to ensure simplification functions handle container types (like Sets) correctly by leaving constant containers unchanged or simplifying their contents.
