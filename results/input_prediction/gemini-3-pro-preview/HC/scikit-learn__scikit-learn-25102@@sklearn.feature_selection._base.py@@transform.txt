The given function `transform` is a method of `SelectorMixin`. We need to predict the input that results in the output `[[0 1]]`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the output**: The output `[[0 1]]` is the string representation of a numpy array with shape `(1, 2)` containing integers `0` and `1`. This is the result of applying feature selection on an input array `X`.
2.  **Analyze `transform` method**:
    *   The method calls `_validate_data` on `X` with `dtype=None`. This implies that if `X` consists of integers, it will remain integers (unlike `dtype=float`).
    *   It then calls `_transform(X)`, which calls `get_support()` to generate a boolean mask of features to keep.
    *   Finally, it returns `_safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1)`.
3.  **Deduce inputs**:
    *   **`X`**: To obtain `[[0, 1]]` as output, the simplest solution is that the input `X` was also `[[0, 1]]` and all features (both columns) were selected.
    *   **`n_features_in_`**: `_validate_data` calls `_check_n_features`. For an input `X` of shape `(1, 2)`, the estimator must expect 2 features. Thus, `n_features_in_` must be `2`.
    *   **Feature Selection Logic (`percentile`, `scores_`, `pvalues_`)**: The attributes `score_func`, `percentile`, `scores_`, and `pvalues_` suggest the class behaves like `SelectPercentile` (or `GenericUnivariateSelect` with percentile mode). To ensure all (both) features of `X` are selected, we can set `percentile` to `100`.
    *   **`scores_` and `pvalues_`**: These must be arrays (lists in JSON) of length equal to `n_features_in_` (which is 2). With `percentile=100`, their specific values don't effectively filter anything, but they must be present to satisfy internal checks of a fitted estimator. We can set them to arbitrary values like `[1.0, 1.0]` and `[0.5, 0.5]`.
4.  **Verify**:
    *   Input `X` = `[[0, 1]]`.
    *   Validation passes (`n_features_in_=2`).
    *   `percentile=100` selects all features -> mask `[True, True]`.
    *   Indexing keeps all columns -> Output `[[0, 1]]`. Matches.
