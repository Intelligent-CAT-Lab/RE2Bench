The function `_symbolic_factor_list` calculates the symbolic factorization of an expression.
1.  **Analyze the Output**:
    *   The output is a tuple `(coeff, factors)`.
    *   `coeff` is `"1"`, corresponding to `S.One` (integer 1).
    *   `factors` is `[[ "Poly((cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')", 1 ]]`.
    *   This structure implies the list of factors contains a single polynomial `Poly(cos(phi), cos(phi))` with exponent `1`.

2.  **Deduce `expr`**:
    *   The code iterates over `Mul.make_args(expr)`.
    *   For each argument, it converts it to a polynomial using `_poly_from_expr` and calls the factorization method.
    *   The resulting factor is `cos(phi)`. The simplest expression that yields this factor with a coefficient of 1 is `cos(phi)` itself.
    *   Therefore, `expr` is `cos(phi)`.

3.  **Deduce `method`**:
    *   The code retrieves the method dynamically: `getattr(poly, method + '_list')`.
    *   `Poly` objects generally have `factor_list` and `sqf_list`.
    *   The output format matches both, but `factor_list` is the standard method for full factorization into irreducibles. `sqf_list` returns square-free factors.
    *   For a simple irreducible term like `cos(phi)`, both return the same structure. However, "factor" is the standard operation associated with this function name.
    *   I will use `"factor"`.

4.  **Deduce `opt`**:
    *   The structure provided requires `opt` to be a dictionary with a `"fraction"` key.
    *   In SymPy's `factor` function, options manage behavior like domain, fractions, etc.
    *   `fraction=True` is a common default or setting to handle rational expressions correctly (though `cos(phi)` doesn't strictly need it, it's safer to assume explicitly set options are true boolean flags in this context).
    *   I will set `"fraction"` to `true`.

5.  **Reconstruct the Input**:
    *   `expr`: `"cos(phi)"`
    *   `opt`: `{"fraction": true}`
    *   `method`: `"factor"`
