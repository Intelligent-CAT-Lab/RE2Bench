To determine the input of the function `_complement` that produces the output `FiniteSet(1)`, we analyze the function logic and the provided output.

The output is given as:
```json
{
    "_elements": "frozenset({1})"
}
```
This structure corresponds to a `FiniteSet` object in SymPy, specifically one containing the single element `1`. Thus, the function `_complement` returns `FiniteSet(1)`.

The function `_complement(self, other)` computes the complement of `self` with respect to `other`, which is effectively the set difference `other - self`.
The implementation for `FiniteSet` is:
```python
elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):
    # sifts elements of 'other' based on whether they are in 'self'
    # returns elements of 'other' that are NOT in 'self' (where contains is False)
```
Specifically, it returns `Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), ...)`, where `sifted[False]` contains elements of `other` for which `self.contains(el)` is `False`.

We want the result to be `{1}`. This implies:
1. The element `1` must be in `other`.
2. The element `1` must *not* be in `self` (so `self.contains(1)` is `False`).
3. If `other` contained any other elements, they would also appear in the result unless `self` contained them.

The input structure provided for `self` is `{}`, which has no placeholders to modify. This empty structure typically represents a simple object like `S.EmptySet` or a singleton with no relevant state for this serialization. If `self` is `S.EmptySet`, it contains no elements, so `self.contains(x)` is always `False`.
In this case, `other - self` is simply `other`.
For the result to be `FiniteSet(1)`, `other` must be exactly `FiniteSet(1)`.

The input structure for `other` asks for `_elements`. In SymPy's `FiniteSet`, `_elements` stores a `frozenset` of the arguments. The output shows this as the string `"frozenset({1})"`. Therefore, we should provide this string in the input.

[THOUGHT]
The user wants the input to `_complement` that results in `FiniteSet(1)`.
The operation is `other - self`.
The structure for `self` is fixed as empty `{}`, implying `self` is `S.EmptySet` or disjoint from the target element.
If `self` is empty, then `other - EmptySet = other`.
Therefore, `other` must be `FiniteSet(1)`.
The `FiniteSet` object stores its elements in `_elements`.
The output representation of `_elements` is `"frozenset({1})"`.
So `other` is defined by `"_elements": "frozenset({1})"`.
