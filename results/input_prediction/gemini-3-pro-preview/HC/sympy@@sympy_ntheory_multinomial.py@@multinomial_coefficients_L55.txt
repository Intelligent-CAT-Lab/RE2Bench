To determine the input values `m` and `n`, let's analyze the properties of the output dictionary provided:

The keys represent tuples of integers, and the values represent coefficient counts.
Example Key: `"(2, 0, 0, 0)"`
The length of this tuple is 4, which suggests the number of variables `m` is **4**.

The sum of the components in the tuple is `2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2`.
Checking another key: `"(1, 1, 0, 0)"` -> `1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`.
Checking another: `"(0, 0, 1, 1)"` -> `0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.
Since the sum of exponents in a multinomial expansion corresponds to the power `n`, this suggests `n` is **2**.

Let's simulate the execution with `m=4` and `n=2` to confirm.
1. `multinomial_coefficients(4, 2)` is called.
2. `m = 4`, `n = 2`.
3. The check `if m >= 2 * n and n > 1:` evaluates to `4 >= 4 and 2 > 1`, which is True.
4. The function returns `dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2))`.
5. Inside `multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2)`:
    - `m=4, n=2`. `m < 2*n` (4 < 4) is False.
    - It goes to the `else` block.
    - It calculates base coefficients `mc = multinomial_coefficients(2, 2)`.
    - `multinomial_coefficients(2, 2)` calls `binomial_coefficients(2)` because `m==2`.
    - `binomial_coefficients(2)` returns `{(2, 0): 1, (1, 1): 2, (0, 2): 1}`.
    - The iterator filters zeros from keys to map coefficients. `mc` effectively maps `(2,) -> 1` and `(1,1) -> 2`.
    - The iterator then iterates through partitions of 2 into 4 slots in co-lexicographic order.
    - Start: `t = [2, 0, 0, 0]`. Yields `((2, 0, 0, 0), 1)`.
    - Next: shift from index 0 to 1. `t` becomes `[1, 1, 0, 0]`. Non-zero parts `(1,1)`. Yields `((1, 1, 0, 0), 2)`.
    - Next: shift. `t` becomes `[0, 2, 0, 0]`. Non-zero parts `(2,)`. Yields `((0, 2, 0, 0), 1)`.
    - Next: shift to index 2. `t` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0]`. Non-zero parts `(1,1)`. Yields `((1, 0, 1, 0), 2)`.
    - ... and so on covering all permutations.
This matches the provided output exactly.
