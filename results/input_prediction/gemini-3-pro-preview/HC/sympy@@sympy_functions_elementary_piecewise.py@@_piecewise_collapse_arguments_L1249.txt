The function `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` is designed to simplify the arguments of a Piecewise function. It iterates through the provided `(expression, condition)` pairs and attempts to simplify them based on conditions that have already been processed (`current_cond`).

The output provided is `[(1, x < 0), (3, True)]`.
This indicates:
1.  The first pair is `(1, x < 0)`. The condition `x < 0` was accepted as is.
2.  The second pair is `(3, True)`. `True` often acts as a catch-all (else) condition in Piecewise functions.

While the input could technically have been `[(1, x < 0), (3, True)]` (which would remain unchanged), the function name "collapse" and the logic provided suggest it performs simplifications. The specific logic block:
```python
elif isinstance(cond, Relational):
    if cond.negated.canonical in current_cond:
        cond = S.true
```
shows that if a condition is the exact negation of a previously seen condition (and that previous condition is active, i.e., in `current_cond`), it is replaced by `True`.

This is the standard logic for `Piecewise((1, x < 0), (3, x >= 0))`.
1.  `(1, x < 0)` is processed. `x < 0` is added to `current_cond`.
2.  `(3, x >= 0)` is processed. The negation of `x >= 0` is `x < 0`. Since `x < 0` works matches the entry in `current_cond`, `x >= 0` is collapsed to `True`.

Thus, the most likely original input that exercises the function's logic to produce the processed output is `[(1, x < 0), (3, x >= 0)]`.
