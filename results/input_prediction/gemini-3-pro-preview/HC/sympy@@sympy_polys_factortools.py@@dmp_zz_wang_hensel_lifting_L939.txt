The function `dmp_zz_wang_hensel_lifting` lifts a univariate factorization of a polynomial `f` (evaluated at specific points for the other variables) to the full multivariate factorization.

Based on the output `[[[1], [1, 0]], [[1], [-1, 0]]]`:
1.  There are two factors.
2.  The output factors are in dense recursive representation (`dmp`).
3.  The structure `[[1], [1, 0]]` suggests `u=1` (2 variables, say $x$ and $y$). The first element `[1]` is the coefficient of $x^1$ (which is $1$). The second element `[1, 0]` is the coefficient of $x^0$, which is a polynomial in $y$: $1\cdot y + 0 = y$. Thus, the first factor is $x + y$.
4.  Similarly, `[[1], [-1, 0]]` represents $x - y$.
5.  Therefore, the polynomial being factored is $f = (x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$.

Reconstructing the input arguments:
*   `f`: The representation of $x^2 - y^2$ in `dmp` with `u=1` over `ZZ`.
    *   Degree in $x$ is 2.
    *   Coeff of $x^2$: $1$ $\to$ `[1]`.
    *   Coeff of $x^1$: $0$ $\to$ `[]`.
    *   Coeff of $x^0$: $-y^2$. $-y^2$ in $y$ is `[-1, 0, 0]`.
    *   So `f` is `[[1], [], [-1, 0, 0]]`.
*   `u`: The output implies 2 variables ($x, y$). In SymPy `dmp`, this corresponds to `u=1`.
*   `A`: The evaluation points used to reduce `f` to a univariate polynomial. The standard convenient point is $y=1$. If $y=1$, `f = x^2 - 1`. `A` is a list `[1]`.
*   `H`: The modular factors of $f$ evaluated at `A`. Factors of $x^2 - 1$ are $x+1$ and $x-1$.
    *   $x+1$ in `dmp` ($u=0$) is `[1, 1]`.
    *   $x-1$ in `dmp` ($u=0$) is `[1, -1]`.
    *   The output order matches $x+y$ then $x-y$. Since $x+y$ at $y=1$ is $x+1$, the first element of `H` must be `[1, 1]`. The second is `[1, -1]`.
    *   `H` is `[[1, 1], [1, -1]]`.
*   `LC`: Leading coefficients of the factors. Both $x+y$ and $x-y$ are monic in $x$. The leading coefficient (in $x$) is $1$ (as a polynomial in $y$). `[1]` represented as `dmp` with `u=0` is `[1]`. So `LC` is `[[1], [1]]`.
*   `p`: A prime or bound. Since the output coefficients are small (1, -1), a small prime like `5` is sufficient and typical (assuming `A=[1]` works modulo 5).
*   `K`: The domain. Based on imports and context (`dmp_zz...`), this is `ZZ`.
