The function `delete_parameter` is a decorator (or decorator factory) that marks a parameter as deprecated and eventually removes it from the signature.
1. **Analyze the Output**: The output is `"<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>"`. This represents the return value of `delete_parameter`. Since it returns a function (the wrapper), the input `func` must have been provided (it was not `None`). The returned function carries the name `func2` and is scoped inside `test_delete_parameter`. This implies the input `func` had the same name and scope (due to `functools.wraps`).
2. **Retrieve `func`**: The input `func` must correspond to the object representing `test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2`. In the JSON input format, we represent this function object by its string representation found in the output.
3. **Determine `since` and `name`**: The function execution modifies the signature of `func` to remove `name`. This code snippet originates from standard library tests (specifically Matplotlib's API tests). The test case involving `func2` inside `test_delete_parameter` typically looks like: `_api.delete_parameter("3.1", "y", func2)`.
   - `since` is likely "3.1" based on the matched test case for `func2`.
   - `name` is likely "y", the parameter being deleted in that test case.
4. **Construct Arguments**:
   - `since`: "3.1"
   - `name`: "y"
   - `func`: "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>"
   - `kwargs`: Empty.
