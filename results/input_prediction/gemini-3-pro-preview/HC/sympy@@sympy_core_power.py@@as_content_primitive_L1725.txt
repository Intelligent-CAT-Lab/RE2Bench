The function `as_content_primitive` separates an expression into a rational content and a primitive factor (where the content is 1). The output provided is `(1, sqrt(2))`, which corresponds to `(content, primitive)`.
This means:
1.  The content extracted is `1`.
2.  The remaining primitive expression is `sqrt(2)`.

Let's evaluate likely inputs for `Pow(base, exp)`:
*   If `self` is `sqrt(2)`, which corresponds to `Pow(2, 1/2)`:
    *   `b=2`, `e=1/2`.
    *   `b` is Rational. `ce=1/2`, `pe=1`.
    *   `ceh` (coeff * h) = `1/2`.
    *   `iceh, r = divmod(1, 2)` -> `0, 1`.
    *   Content `c = Pow(2, 0) = 1`.
    *   The primitive part is reconstructed using remainder `r` to be `Pow(2, 1/2)`.
    *   Result: `(1, sqrt(2))`. This matches the output perfectly.
*   Other inputs like `sqrt(8)` (`Pow(8, 1/2)`) would reduce to `2*sqrt(2)` leading to content `2`.
*   Standard arguments for `radical` and `clear` are `False` and `True` respectively. Since the input `Pow(2, 1/2)` produces the target output with these defaults, we assume them. `Integer(2)` is used for the base and `Rational(1, 2)` for the exponent.
