The user wants to find the input to `polytope_integrate` that yields `"1/8"`.
`polytope_integrate` computes the definite integral of a polynomial over a 2D polytope (Polygon).
Possible scenarios yielding 1/8:
1. Integration over the unit square `Polygon((0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1))`?
   - $\int xy dx dy = 1/4$.
   - $\int x^3 y dx dy = 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8$. This is a candidate ($\text{expr} = x^3 y$).
2. Integration over a basic triangle `Polygon((0,0), (1,0), (1,1))` (Triangle $T1$: $0 \le x \le 1, 0 \le y \le x$).
   - $\int xy dA = \int_0^1 \int_0^x xy dy dx = \int_0^1 \frac{x^3}{2} dx = \frac{1}{8}$. This is a candidate for `expr = x*y`.
3. Integration over integration triangle `Polygon((0,0), (1,1), (0,1))` (Triangle $T2$: $0 \le y \le 1, 0 \le x \le y$).
   - $\int xy dA$ is symmetric to $T1$ for symmetric integrand $xy$. Result 1/8.

Between "Square with $x^3 y$" and "Triangle with $xy$", the triangle with `xy` (degree 2) is a simpler polynomial than $x^3 y$ (degree 4). Standard test cases usually start with lower degrees. The triangle `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)` is a very standard simplex.
I will select `poly = Polygon(Point(0, 0), Point(1, 0), Point(1, 1))` and `expr = x * y`. The default orientation is counter-clockwise, so `clockwise=False`.
