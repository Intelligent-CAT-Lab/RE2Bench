[THOUGHT]
The function `restify` begins with a conditional check: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`.
If this condition evaluates to true, the function immediately returns `':py:obj:`None`'`.
Since the target output is exactly `':py:obj:`None`'`, the input `cls` must satisfy this condition.
The simplest value that satisfies this is `None`. In JSON format, the Python value `None` is represented as `null`.
