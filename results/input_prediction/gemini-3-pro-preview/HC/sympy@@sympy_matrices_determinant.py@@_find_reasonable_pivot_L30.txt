To predict the input, I'll simulate the execution of `_find_reasonable_pivot` backwards from the output and traces.

**Analysis of Output:**
The output is `(0, "-9", False, [])`.
*   Index `0`: The pivot is at the first element of `col`.
*   Pivot `"-9"`: The chosen pivot value is `-9`. The quotes in JSON imply it's a string representation, likely of a SymPy `Integer(-9)`. `Integer` stringifies to `"-9"`, whereas `Float` would be `"-9.0"`.
*   Is Zero Assumed `False`: The pivot was determined to be non-zero (or assumed non-zero in the float block).
*   Newly Determined `[]`: No symbolic zero information was gathered.

**Trace Analysis:**
The "Functions called" list provides critical clues about the execution path:
1.  `sympy.sympy.matrices.determinant.<listcomp>`: This suggests the list comprehension `col_abs = [abs(x) for x in col]` inside the "Float/Integer optimization block" might have been executed. For this to happen, `any(isinstance(x, Float) ...)` must be true.
2.  `sympy.sympy.matrices.utilities._simplify` and `sympy.sympy.simplify.simplify.signsimp`: This indicates that `simpfunc` (Pass 2) was executed.
3.  `sympy.sympy.core.expr.equals`: This indicates that Pass 3 (equality check) might have been touched or called by `simplify`.

**Contradiction and Resolution:**
*   If the "Float/Integer block" is entered (Trace 1), the function returns immediately. It does *not* proceed to Pass 2 (`_simplify`).
*   If Pass 2 is entered (Trace 2), the "Float/Integer block" must *not* have been entered (or at least satisfied).
*   The output pivot is `"-9"` (Integer). If we entered the Float block, we would return the element as-is. If `col` contained a `Float`, the returned pivot might be `Float`. But since output is `Integer`, the pivot at index 0 must be `Integer`.
*   If we enter Pass 2 (`_simplify`), it means Pass 1 (`iszerofunc`) failed to determine if elements were zero (returned `None`). `Integer(-9).is_zero` is `False`, so Pass 1 would handle it and return immediately, *skipping* `_simplify`.
*   For `_simplify` to be called, `iszerofunc(col[0])` must return `None`. A string `"-9"` (if passed as input) has no `.is_zero` attribute, so `getattr("-9", "is_zero", None)` returns `None`. `_simplify("-9")` converts it to `Integer(-9)`, which has `is_zero=False`. This matches the output `(0, -9, False, [])` and explains the presence of `_simplify` in the trace.

Although passing strings to a function expecting `Iterable[Expr]` is unusual, it fits the trace (Pass 1 fail -> Pass 2 success) and output perfectly. However, the trace might simply be a list of functions in the context rather than a strict runtime call graph for this exact call. A more standard input `[-9]` (list of Integers) generates the correct output but skips `_simplify`. Given that `_simplify` is in the provided list, and `["-9"]` works logically with the code flow to trigger it, `["-9"]` is a plausible prediction. But `[-9]` is the standard usage.
*Correction*: If we assume standard typed input (`[-9]`), the Float block is skipped (no Float), Pass 1 executes, finding `-9` is non-zero, and returns. `_simplify` is not called. If we follow the "Functions called" strictly implying those functions *must* run, then `["-9"]` is the only input that forces `_simplify`. However, often in these problems, the trace includes dependent functions. Let's look at `equals`. `simplify` calls `equals` often.
Let's assume the most robust input that yields the result: `["-9"]`. It explains the `_simplify` call which converts the input string to the output Integer.

**Function Arguments:**
The structure requires defining `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc`. Since `_iszero` and `_simplify` are the defaults and appear in the trace, we will specify them by name.

**Input Construction:**
*   `col`: `["-9"]` (List containing the string "-9", which effectively simulates the need for simplification/conversion).
*   `iszerofunc`: `"_iszero"`
*   `simpfunc`: `"_simplify"`
