To determine the input parameters for `make_classification`, we analyze the output `X` and `y` against the function's logic.

1.  **`n_samples`**: The output `X` has 50 rows and `y` has 50 elements. Thus, `n_samples=50`.
2.  **`n_features`**: The output `X` has 2 columns. Thus, `n_features=2`.
3.  **`n_classes`**: The target vector `y` contains only zeros (`0`). This implies `n_classes=1` (a single class).
4.  **Feature Composition (`n_informative`, `n_redundant`)**: With `n_features=2`, the sum of informative, redundant, and repeated features must be $\le 2$. Since both columns contain distinct, non-constant values that appear structured, we assume `n_informative=2`, `n_redundant=0`, and `n_repeated=0`.
5.  **`shift`**: The values in `X` are large, centered approximately around `328435.5` in the first column and `-255363.5` in the second column. The `make_classification` function essentially generates data as `(raw_data + shift) * scale`. Since the default `shift` is generated randomly around 0 with small magnitude, these specific large offsets must be provided explicitly. Calculating the approximate mean of the columns gives `shift=[328435.5, -255363.5]`.
6.  **`scale`**: The spread (max - min) of the data in each column is roughly 2.0 to 3.0. For standard normal distributed data (approx range 4-6 for N=50), a range of ~3 is consistent with a scaling factor of 1. Default scaling is random (1 to 100), which would produce much larger spreads. Thus, `scale` must be explicitly set to `1.0`.
7.  **`n_clusters_per_class`**: With `n_classes=1`, we observe a single cluster of data points. To maintain the variance close to 1 (consistent with `scale=1.0`), `n_clusters_per_class` is likely `1` (default is 2, which would spread data out more).
8.  **Other parameters**: `class_sep`, `flip_y`, `weights`, `hypercube`, `shuffle`, `random_state` are likely at their default values (`1.0`, `0.01`, `None`, `True`, `True`, `None`). We'll use `null` for `random_state` as no specific seed can be confidently derived from the coordinates alone, though usually, one is set for reproducibility.
