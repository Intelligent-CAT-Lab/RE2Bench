The function `get_gpa(self, name)` calculates the average of the course scores for a given student name. The output provided is `75.0`.

I need to find a student in the structure whose course average equals 75.0.

Let's look at the structure and fill in possible values to see what works. The structure defines three students: "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie". Since I need to fill in the `XXX` placeholders, I effectively need to construct a scenario where one of these students has an average of 75.0.

Let's pick "Alice" as the target student. She has two courses: "Mathematics" and "Science".
To get an average of 75.0, `(Math + Science) / 2 = 75`.
So `Math + Science = 150`.
I can set Math = 80 and Science = 70.

Let's check "Bob". He has one course "Physics". If I set Physics = 75, his average is 75. But usually, these examples imply filling out reasonable dummy data for everyone and specific data for the target.

Let's check "Charlie". Courses: "Chemistry" and "Physics". `(Chem + Phys) / 2 = 75`.

To make the solution robust, I will define:
- **Alice**: Math=80, Science=70. Average = 75.0.
- **Bob**: Physics=90. Average = 90.0.
- **Charlie**: Chemistry=60, Physics=60. Average = 60.0.

So if I call `get_gpa("Alice")`, I get 75.0.

Therefore, the input `name` must be "Alice". The values for the other fields (name, grade, major) are just metadata and don't affect the calculation, but they must be consistent strings or integers.

Structure to fill:
- `self.students['Alice']`:
    - name: "Alice"
    - courses: {"Mathematics": 80, "Science": 70} -> Average = 75.0
- `self.students['Bob']`:
    - courses: {"Physics": 90}
- `self.students['Charlie']`:
    - courses: {"Chemistry": 60, "Physics": 60}

Target argument `name`: "Alice".
