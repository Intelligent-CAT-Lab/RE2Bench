Based on the provided Python code and the desired output, here is the thought process to deduce the input:

[THOUGHT]
The code snippet performs a simple mathematical iteration 10 times.
The core formula is `x_new = r * x_old - D`.
The input consists of three integers: `r`, `D`, and the initial value of `x`.

Let's look at the first few lines of the output to establish a system of equations.
Let $x_0$ be the initial input value for x.
Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$ be the values printed in each iteration.

From the output:
$x_1 = 110$
$x_2 = 120$
$x_3 = 140$

The code logic gives us:
1. $x_1 = r * x_0 - D$
2. $x_2 = r * x_1 - D$
3. $x_3 = r * x_2 - D$

We can use equations (2) and (3) to solve for `r` and `D` because we know $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.
$120 = r * 110 - D$  (Equation A)
$140 = r * 120 - D$  (Equation B)

Subtract Equation A from Equation B:
$(140 - 120) = (r * 120 - D) - (r * 110 - D)$
$20 = 120r - 110r$
$20 = 10r$
$r = 2$

Now substitute `r = 2` back into Equation A to find `D`:
$120 = 2 * 110 - D$
$120 = 220 - D$
$D = 220 - 120$
$D = 100$

Now we have `r = 2` and `D = 100`. We need to find the initial input `x` ($x_0$).
We use the very first relation:
$x_1 = r * x_0 - D$
$110 = 2 * x_0 - 100$
$210 = 2 * x_0$
$x_0 = 105$

Let's verify this with the next value in the sequence ($x_4 = 180$):
$x_4 = r * x_3 - D$
$x_4 = 2 * 140 - 100$
$x_4 = 280 - 100$
$x_4 = 180$. This matches the output.

So the input values are:
`r = 2`
`D = 100`
`x = 105`

The input format expects these three numbers separated by spaces on a single line.
Input string: "2 100 105"
