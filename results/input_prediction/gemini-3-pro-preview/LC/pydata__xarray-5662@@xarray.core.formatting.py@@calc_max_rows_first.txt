The function `calc_max_rows_first` takes an integer `max_rows` and returns `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2`. We are given that the output is 6.
We can set up the equation: `x // 2 + x % 2 = 6`.

Let's analyzing two cases for `x`:
1. If `x` is even, then `x % 2 == 0`. The equation becomes `x // 2 = 6`, which implies `x = 12`.
2. If `x` is odd, then `x % 2 == 1`. The equation becomes `(x // 2) + 1 = 6` => `x // 2 = 5`. Since `x` is an integer, `x` could be 10 (even, invalid here) or 11. `11 // 2` is 5. So `x = 11`.

Both 11 and 12 result in an output of 6.
- `calc_max_rows_first(11) = 5 + 1 = 6`
- `calc_max_rows_first(12) = 6 + 0 = 6`

In the context of display options (`max_rows`), even numbers are slightly more conventional for settings (e.g., displaying top 6 and bottom 6). I will select 12 as the most likely input.
