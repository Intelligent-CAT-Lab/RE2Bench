To return `True`, the function `template_changed` must satisfy two main conditions regarding `file_path`:
1. `file_path.suffix` must not be `.py`.
2. `file_path` must be located inside one of the directories returned by `get_template_directories()`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Trigger for True:** The function returns `True` only if `file_path` is considered a template file. This logic checks that the file extension is not `.py` and that the file resides within a known template directory.
2.  **Determine `file_path` characteristics:**
    *   It must act like a `pathlib.Path` object (has `.suffix`, `.parents`).
    *   `file_path.suffix` != `.py`. A standard choice is `.html`.
    *   The path must be a subdirectory of a path returned by `get_template_directories()`.
3.  **Simulate `get_template_directories()`:** This function calculates absolute paths for configured template directories based on `Path.cwd()`. Assuming a standard environment where the current working directory is `/app` and there is a `templates` folder configured in Django settings, `get_template_directories()` would return a set containing `/app/templates`.
4.  **Construct `file_path`:** To satisfy the condition `template_dir in file_path.parents`, `file_path` must be deeper than the template root. For example, `/app/templates/index.html`.
    *   Suffix: `.html` (Passes the `.py` check).
    *   Parents: `['/app/templates', '/app', '/']`.
    *   Condition: `/app/templates` is in parents. (Evalutes to True).
5.  **Determine `sender`:** The `sender` argument is unused in the function body. In Django signals, it is often an object, but since it's ignored, `null` (None) is the appropriate placeholder.
6.  **Comparison with Constraints:** We need to provide the inputs in JSON format. Although `file_path` is a Path object in Python, in the input JSON it is represented as a string which the test harness is understood to convert or utilize as a Path.
