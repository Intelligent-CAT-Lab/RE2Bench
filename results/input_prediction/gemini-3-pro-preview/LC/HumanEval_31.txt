[THOUGHT]
The function `is_prime(n)` returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.
The provided output is `True`.
This means the input `n` must be a prime number.
Let's analyze the code logic:
1. `if n < 2: return False`. So `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
2. The loop runs from `k = 2` to `n - 2` (`range(2, n - 1)`).
3. If `n` is divisible by any `k` in this range, it returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns `True`.

I just need to pick any valid prime number.
Let's choose a simple prime number like 7.
- Is 7 < 2? No.
- Loop `k` from 2 to 6.
- 7 % 2 != 0
- 7 % 3 != 0
- 7 % 4 != 0
- 7 % 5 != 0
- 7 % 6 != 0
- Returns `True`.

Other options: 2, 3, 5, 11, 13, etc. 7 is a solid choice. Let's use 7.
