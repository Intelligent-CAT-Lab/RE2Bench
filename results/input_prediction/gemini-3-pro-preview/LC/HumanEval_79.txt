[THOUGHT]
The function `decimal_to_binary` performs the following steps:
1.  It takes an input `decimal`.
2.  It converts this input to its binary string representation using `bin(decimal)`. For example, `bin(5)` returns `'0b101'`.
3.  It slices this string from the 3rd character (index 2) onwards to remove the `'0b'` prefix. For `bin(5)`, `[2:]` results in `'101'`.
4.  It prepends `'db'` and appends `'db'` to this binary string.

Given the output `"db0db"`:
1.  The output starts with `'db'` and ends with `'db'`. Removing these leaves the core string `"0"`.
2.  This core string `"0"` corresponds to `bin(decimal)[2:]`.
3.  Therefore, `bin(decimal)` must have been `'0b0'`.
4.  The integer that results in the binary representation `'0b0'` is `0`.

Refining the value:
If `decimal` is `0`:
- `bin(0)` -> `'0b0'`
- `bin(0)[2:]` -> `'0'`
- `'db' + '0' + 'db'` -> `'db0db'`

This matches the desired output.
