The output is `{ "output": null }`. This suggests that the function `morsel_to_cookie` did not return a value successfully, which implies an exception was raised during its execution.

Looking at `morsel_to_cookie`:
1. It retrieves `morsel['max-age']`.
2. If `morsel['max-age']` is truthy, it tries `int(morsel['max-age'])`.
3. If this raises a `ValueError` (e.g. if the string is not an integer), it catches it and raises a `TypeError`.

This `TypeError` would interrupt execution, resulting in no return value (captured as `null`).

If `max-age` were valid or skipped, `create_cookie` would be called. `create_cookie` returns a `cookielib.Cookie` object, which would not be `null`.

Therefore, to reproduce the `null` output, we must supply a `max-age` value that is truthy (so the `if` block is entered) but not a valid integer string (so `int()` fails). "dummy" is a suitable string.

We can set other fields to `null` (None) as they won't be processed or cause issues before the exception.
