The function `f` takes a list `nums`. It calculates the length of the list, let's call it `N`. Then, it iterates `N - 1` times. In each iteration, it reverses the list `nums` in place using `nums.reverse()`. Finally, it returns the modified list.

Let's analyze the effect of reversing the list `N - 1` times.
- If `N - 1` is an even number, reversing the list an even number of times results in the original list.
- If `N - 1` is an odd number, reversing the list an odd number of times results in the reversed list.

Let's look at the given output: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
The length of this output list is `N = 7`.

The loop runs `range(N - 1)` times, which is `range(6)`.
So, the loop runs 6 times.
Since 6 is an even number, the list is reversed 6 times.
Reversing a list an even number of times brings it back to its original state.

Therefore, the input list must be exactly the same as the output list.

Verification:
Input: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
Length `N = 7`.
Loop runs `7 - 1 = 6` times.
1. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
2. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
3. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
4. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
5. Reverse -> `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
6. Reverse -> `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
Result matches the output.
