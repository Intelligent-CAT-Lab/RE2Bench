The function `f` performs the following operations:
1.  Creates a copy of the input `array`.
2.  Reverses the copied array.
3.  Returns a new list where each element `x` from the reversed array is squared (`x * x`).

We are given the output `[1, 4, 1]`. Let's work backwards:
1.  The output is the result of squaring elements. So, `[x1^2, x2^2, x3^2] = [1, 4, 1]`.
    *   `x1^2 = 1` => `x1` could be 1 or -1.
    *   `x2^2 = 4` => `x2` could be 2 or -2.
    *   `x3^2 = 1` => `x3` could be 1 or -1.

    Let's assume the simplest case where the inputs are positive integers, though negative are possible. `[1, 2, 1]` is a likely candidate for the list *after* reversal.

2.  This list `[1, 2, 1]` (or similar variants) is the result of `reversed(new_array)`.
    If the reversed array is `[1, 2, 1]`, then the original `new_array` was `[1, 2, 1]` (since it's a palindrome).
    Let's try a non-palindrome for clarity. If output was `[1, 4]`, reversed was `[1, 2]`, so original was `[2, 1]`.
    Here, output is `[1, 4, 1]`.
    Reversed inputs (before squaring) could be `[1, 2, 1]`.
    Therefore, the original input `array` must be `[1, 2, 1]` reversed back, which is still `[1, 2, 1]`.

    Let's check another possibility. Maybe the original array was `[1, -2, 1]`.
    `reversed` -> `[1, -2, 1]`.
    squared -> `[1, 4, 1]`. This works.

    Let's check `[-1, 2, -1]`.
    `reversed` -> `[-1, 2, -1]`.
    squared -> `[1, 4, 1]`. This also works.

    The most straightforward answer usually involves positive integers unless context suggests otherwise. Let's assume the input was `[1, 2, 1]`.

    Let's verify forward:
    Input: `[1, 2, 1]`
    Copy: `[1, 2, 1]`
    Reversed: `[1, 2, 1]`
    Squared: `[1*1, 2*2, 1*1]` -> `[1, 4, 1]`. Matches.

    Wait, did I get the order right?
    Output list `[y0, y1, y2]` corresponds to `[x_last^2, ..., x_first^2]`.
    So `y0 = x_last^2`. `y1 = x_second_to_last^2`.
    We have `[1, 4, 1]`.
    `1` corresponds to the last element of the input.
    `4` corresponds to the middle element.
    `1` corresponds to the first element.
    So input is `[1, 2, 1]` (if positive).

    Let's try an asymmetric example to be absolutely sure about the reversal.
    Suppose output was `[1, 4]`.
    1 (index 0) comes from the *last* element of input. Last element squared is 1 => 1.
    4 (index 1) comes from the *second to last* (which is first here) element. First element squared is 4 => 2.
    So input would be `[2, 1]`.
    Function trace: `[2, 1]` -> reversed is `[1, 2]` -> squared is `[1, 4]`. Correct.

    Back to `[1, 4, 1]`.
    Input `[1, 2, 1]`.
    Last element 1 -> squared is 1.
    Middle 2 -> squared is 4.
    First 1 -> squared is 1.
    Result `[1, 4, 1]`.

    So the input `[1, 2, 1]` is the correct prediction.
