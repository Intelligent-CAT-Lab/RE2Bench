To predict the input, let's analyze the python code step by step.

1.  **`stdin = input()`**: The code reads a string from the input.
2.  **`result = 'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'`**: The code checks two conditions:
    *   Does the string contain the uppercase letter 'A'?
    *   Does the string contain the uppercase letter 'B'?
    *   If *both* are true, the result is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".
3.  **`print(result)`**: The result is printed.

**Given Output:**
The output is `Yes`.

**Reasoning:**
Since the output is "Yes", the input string must satisfy the condition `'A' in s and 'B' in s`. This means the input string must contain at least one 'A' and at least one 'B'. The simplest string that satisfies this is "AB", or "BA", or any string containing these characters like "AppleBanana". I need to provide just one valid input.

Therefore, "AB" is a sufficient and simple input.

[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of input into `s`.
It sets `result` to "Yes" if both the characters 'A' and 'B' appear in `s`.
Otherwise, it sets `result` to "No".
The given output is "Yes".
Therefore, the input variable `s` must contain both 'A' and 'B'.
A simple string containing both is "AB". Other possibilities include "BA", "A B", "ABC", etc. I will choose "AB".

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "AB"
}
```
