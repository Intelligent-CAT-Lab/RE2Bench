To determine the input for the provided Python code snippet that results in the output `"YES"`, let's analyze the code logic step-by-step.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Code Logic**:
    *   `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`: The program reads a string, splits it by spaces into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores them in a tuple named `ABC`.
    *   `if ABC.count(5) == 2:`: The code checks if the number `5` appears exactly twice in the tuple `ABC`.
    *   `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')`: If the previous condition is met (two 5s), it checks a second condition: is the sum of all numbers in the tuple equal to 17? If `sum(ABC) == 17`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
    *   `else: print('NO')`: If the count of 5s is not 2, it prints "NO".

2.  **Goal**: We need an output of "YES". This requires satisfying two conditions simultaneously:
    *   Condition A: The tuple `ABC` must contain the number `5` exactly two times.
    *   Condition B: The sum of all elements in `ABC` must be exactly 17.

3.  **Constructing the Input**:
    *   We know `ABC` must contain at least two `5`s. Let's start with `(5, 5)`.
    *   The sum of these two elements is `5 + 5 = 10`.
    *   To reach a total sum of 17, we need the remaining elements to sum to `17 - 10 = 7`.
    *   The remaining elements cannot contain the number `5` (because we are only allowed exactly two 5s, which we already have).
    *   Valid combinations for the remaining sum of 7:
        *   Just `7`. `ABC` would be `(5, 5, 7)`. Check count of 5: 2. Check sum: 17. Valid.
        *   `1, 6`. `ABC` would be `(5, 5, 1, 6)`. Valid.
        *   `3, 4`. `ABC` would be `(5, 5, 3, 4)`. Valid.
    *   Let's pick the simplest valid combination: `5 5 7`.

4.  **Verification**:
    *   Input: `"5 5 7"`
    *   `ABC` becomes `(5, 5, 7)`.
    *   `ABC.count(5)` is `2`. (Condition met).
    *   `sum(ABC)` is `5 + 5 + 7 = 17`. (Condition met).
    *   Output is "YES".

    Another option: `"5 7 5"` or `"7 5 5"`. The order doesn't matter for the logic.
