To determine the input `lst` that results in an output of `0`, let's analyze the `double_the_difference` function.

[THOUGHT]
The function `double_the_difference` calculates the sum of squares of elements in a list `lst`, but only for elements that satisfy specific conditions:
1. `i > 0`: The number must be positive.
2. `i % 2 != 0`: The number must be odd.
3. `'.' not in str(i)`: The number must be an integer (no decimal point in its string representation).

The output is `0`. This means that `sum([...])` resulted in 0. There are two primary ways this can happen:
1. The list `lst` is empty.
2. The list `lst` contains elements, but none of them satisfy all three conditions (positive, odd, integer). For example, the list could contain negative numbers, even numbers, floats, or zeros.

Let's construct a simple input. An empty list `[]` would result in a sum of 0. Alternatively, a list like `[2, -5, 4.5, 0]` would also result in 0 because:
- `2` is even (fails condition 2).
- `-5` is not positive (fails condition 1).
- `4.5` contains a '.' (fails condition 3).
- `0` is not positive (fails condition 1).

Since I need to provide just one valid input to fill the placeholder `XXX`, an empty list is the simplest valid input. Another valid input could be `[2, 4, 6]`. Let's pick a non-empty list to be distinctive, perhaps one containing numbers that get filtered out.

Let's try `[2, -3, 0]`.
- `2`: Positive, but even. Filtered out.
- `-3`: Negative. Filtered out.
- `0`: Not strictly positive. Filtered out.
Sum is 0. This works.

Let's try `[]`. 
Sum is 0. This works too.

I will use `[]` as it is the most fundamental case for a sum of 0.

Wait, looking at previous examples, usually non-trivial inputs are preferred if possible, but an empty list is perfectly valid here. Let's stick with a slightly more descriptive one to show understanding of the constraints, like `[-1, -2, 0]`.
- `-1`: Not positive.
- `-2`: Not positive.
- `0`: Not positive.
Result: 0.

Actually, let's keep it simple. `[]` is usually the canonical answer for "sum is 0".

Let's verify the constraints again.
If input is `[]`:
`[i ** 2 for i in [] if ...]` -> `[]`
`sum([])` -> `0`.

If input is `[5, 4]`:
`5` is positive, odd, integer. `5**2 = 25`. Sum would be 25.
So we must ensure no items pass the filter.

I'll provide `[]` as the input.
