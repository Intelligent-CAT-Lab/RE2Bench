To predict the input `n` and `m` for the function `rounded_avg` given the output `0b101101110`, let's analyze the code and work backwards.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the function log:**
    *   The function calculates the sum of integers from `n` to `m` inclusive.
    *   It calculates the average: `summation / (m - n + 1)`. Since the sum of numbers from `n` to `m` is an arithmetic progression, the average is simply `(n + m) / 2`.
    *   It rounds this average: `round((n + m) / 2)`.
    *   It converts the rounded average to a binary string using `bin()`.

2.  **Analyze the output:**
    *   Output: `0b101101110`
    *   This is a binary string. Let's convert it to an integer.
    *   `101101110` in binary = $2^8 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 366$.

3.  **Formulate the equation:**
    *   The code returns `bin(round((n + m) / 2))`.
    *   Therefore, `round((n + m) / 2) = 366`.
    *   This implies that the average of `n` and `m` is approximately 366.
    *   Equation: `(n + m) / 2 = 366` (or very close to it, such that it rounds to 366).
    *   This simplifies to `n + m = 732`.

4.  **Find valid inputs:**
    *   We need two integers `n` and `m` such that `n <= m` (otherwise it returns -1) and `n + m` is close to 732. Exact 732 implies `(n+m)/2 = 366.0`, which rounds to 366.
    *   Let's pick simple values. If `n` and `m` are close to each other, say `n = 360`, then `m = 732 - 360 = 372`.
    *   Does `rounded_avg(360, 372)` work?
        *   Sum involves numbers from 360 to 372.
        *   Count = 13.
        *   Average = (360 + 372) / 2 = 732 / 2 = 366.
        *   round(366) = 366.
        *   bin(366) = `0b101101110`.
    *   This is a valid solution.
    *   Another simple pair could be equidistant from 366, e.g., `n = 1`, `m = 731`. Average = 366.
    *   Let's check if there are others. If `n + m = 733`, average = 366.5. Python 3's `round` rounds to the nearest even number for .5 cases. 366 is even, so 366.5 rounds to 366. So `n=366, m=367` -> sum=733 -> avg=366.5 -> round=366. This also works.
    *   Let's use `n = 360` and `m = 372` as a robust, clean integer average example. Another very simple one is `n=366, m=366`.

    Let's verify `n=366, m=366`.
    *   Range is just [366]. Sum = 366. Count = 1.
    *   Avg = 366 / 1 = 366.
    *   Result: `0b101101110`. Matches.

    Let's verifying `n=100, m=632`.
    *   Sum = 100...632.
    *   Avg = (100+632)/2 = 366.
    *   Matches.

    I will provide `n=360` and `m=372` as a specific instance.
