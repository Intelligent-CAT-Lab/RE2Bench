[THOUGHT]
The function `f(array)` performs the following steps::
1.  It maps each number `num` in the input `array` to a string consisting of the letter 'n' repeated `num` times (`'n' * num`).
2.  It collects these strings into a list called `just_ns`.
3.  It then iterates over `just_ns` and appends every item to `final_output`.
4.  Finally, it returns `final_output`.

The output provided is `[]`, an empty list.

Let's trace backwards:
- If `final_output` is `[]`, then the loop `for wipe in just_ns:` must not have added any elements, or `just_ns` was empty.
- If `just_ns` was empty, then `list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array))` produced an empty list.
- The `map` function produces an output corresponding one-to-one with the input iterable. For the result to be an empty list, the input `array` must also be an empty list.

Therefore, the input `array` must be `[]`.
