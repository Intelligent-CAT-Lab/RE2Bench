The provided Python function `is_simple_power(x, n)` checks if `x` is a power of `n`. For the function to return `true`, `x` must be equal to `n` raised to some integer exponent (i.e., $x = n^k$ for some integer $k \ge 0$). The function starts with `power = 1` and repeatedly multiplies by `n` until `power` is no longer less than `x`. It then checks if `power == x`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` returns `True` if `x` is a power of `n`.
The code logic is:
1. If `n == 1`, return `x == 1`.
2. Initialize `power = 1`.
3. Loop while `power < x`: multiply `power` by `n`.
4. Finally, return `power == x`.

We need an output of `True`. This means either:
- Case A: `n` is 1 and `x` is 1.
- Case B: The while loop terminates such that `power` exactly equals `x`. This happens if `x` is some integer power of `n` (like $n^0, n^1, n^2, \dots$).

Let's pick a simple example for Case B.
If `n = 2`:
- `power` starts at 1.
- Iteration 1: `power` becomes $1 * 2 = 2$.
- Iteration 2: `power` becomes $2 * 2 = 4$.
- Iteration 3: `power` becomes $4 * 2 = 8$.

If we set `x = 4` and `n = 2`:
1. `n` (2) is not 1.
2. `power` = 1.
3. `while 1 < 4`: `power` becomes 2.
4. `while 2 < 4`: `power` becomes 4.
5. `while 4 < 4` is false. Loop ends.
6. Returns `4 == 4`, which is `True`.

So, `x=4` and `n=2` is a valid input pair. Other examples like `x=1, n=2` or `x=27, n=3` would also work. I will use `x=4` and `n=2`.
