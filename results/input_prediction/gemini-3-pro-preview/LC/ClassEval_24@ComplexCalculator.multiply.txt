The code implements complex number multiplication. We need to find two complex numbers `c1` and `c2` such that their product is `-5 + 10j`.

Let $c1 = a + bi$ and $c2 = c + di$.
The product is $(ac - bd) + (ad + bc)j$.
We are given that the result is $-5 + 10j$.

So we have the system of equations:
1. $ac - bd = -5$
2. $ad + bc = 10$

This is an underdetermined system (2 equations, 4 variables), meaning there are infinitely many solutions. I need to find just one pair that works. Let's try picking simple integers for `c1` and solving for `c2`.

Let's try $c1 = 1 + 2j$ (so $a=1, b=2$).
Substitute into the equations:
1. $1 \cdot c - 2 \cdot d = -5 \Rightarrow c = 2d - 5$
2. $1 \cdot d + 2 \cdot c = 10 \Rightarrow d + 2(2d - 5) = 10$

Solving for $d$:
$d + 4d - 10 = 10$
$5d = 20$
$d = 4$

Now solve for $c$:
$c = 2(4) - 5$
$c = 8 - 5$
$c = 3$

So, if $c1 = 1 + 2j$, then $c2 = 3 + 4j$. Let's verify:
$(1 + 2j) * (3 + 4j) = (1*3 - 2*4) + (1*4 + 2*3)j = (3 - 8) + (4 + 6)j = -5 + 10j$.

This works.

Another simple check, let's try $c1 = 2 + 1j$ (so $a=2, b=1$).
1. $2c - d = -5 \Rightarrow d = 2c + 5$
2. $2d + c = 10 \Rightarrow 2(2c + 5) + c = 10$
$4c + 10 + c = 10$
$5c = 0 \Rightarrow c = 0$
$d = 5$
So $c2 = 0 + 5j = 5j$.
Check: $(2 + 1j) * 5j = 10j + 5j^2 = 10j - 5 = -5 + 10j$.
This also works and looks cleaner.

Let's use the second solution as it's cleaner to write. `c1 = (2+1j)` and `c2 = 5j`. The JSON representation for complex numbers in Python usually looks like strings or constructed objects, but looking at the structure template provided by the prompt, it asks to fill `XXX`. Since the original python code implies `c1` and `c2` are complex objects (accessed via `.real` and `.imag`), I should provide valid Python complex literal representations or strings that evaluate to them. Often in these tasks, strings like `"2+1j"` or direct values are accepted. Based on previous examples, providing the standard representation is best.

Input `c1`: `(2+1j)`
Input `c2`: `5j`

[THOUGHT]
The goal is to find two complex numbers $c1$ and $c2$ whose product is $-5 + 10j$.
Let $c1 = a + bi$ and $c2 = c + di$.
Formula: $(ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i = -5 + 10i$.

Let's test a simple integer value for one of the inputs to look for a solution.
Let $c1 = 2 + 1j$.
Then $(2 + j) * (x + yj) = -5 + 10j$.
$2x + 2yj + xj + yj^2 = -5 + 10j$
$(2x - y) + (2y + x)j = -5 + 10j$

System:
1) $2x - y = -5$ -> $y = 2x + 5$
2) $x + 2y = 10$

Substitute (1) into (2):
$x + 2(2x + 5) = 10$
$x + 4x + 10 = 10$
$5x = 0$ -> $x = 0$

Find y:
$y = 2(0) + 5 = 5$

So $c2 = 0 + 5j = 5j$.

Verification:
$(2+1j) * (5j) = 10j + 5j^2 = 10j - 5 = -5 + 10j$.
This matches the output.
