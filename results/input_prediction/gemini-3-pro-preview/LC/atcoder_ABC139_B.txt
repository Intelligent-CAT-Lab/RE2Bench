To determine the input for the given Python code snippet, we need to understand the mathematical relationship it implements and find values for `t` and `h` that satisfy the equation resulting in the output `2`.

**1. Analyze the Code Logic:**
The code performs the following operations:
1.  `t, h = map(int, input().split())`: It reads two integers, `t` and `h`, from a single line of input.
2.  `print((h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1)`: It calculates an integer result using integer division (`//`) and prints it.

**2. Formulate the Equation:**
Let the output be `O`. The equation is:
`O = (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`

We are given that the output `O` is `2`.
`2 = (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`

**3. Solve for the Variables:**
First, subtract 1 from both sides:
`1 = (h - 2) // (t - 1)`

This equation tells us that when `(h - 2)` is divided by `(t - 1)`, the integer quotient is `1`.
For integer division `A // B = 1`, it implies that `1 * B <= A < 2 * B`.
So, `1 * (t - 1) <= (h - 2) < 2 * (t - 1)`.

Let's pick simple integer values to test this inequality.

*   **Constraint 1:** `t - 1` cannot be 0, so `t` cannot be 1.
*   **Constraint 2:** `t - 1` must be positive (usually in these competitive programming style problems inputs are positive), so assume `t > 1`.

Let's pick an arbitrary value for `t` and solve for `h`.
Let **`t = 3`**.
Then `t - 1 = 2`.
The inequality becomes:
`2 <= h - 2 < 2 * 2`
`2 <= h - 2 < 4`

Add 2 to all parts:
`4 <= h < 6`

So, for `t = 3`, `h` can be `4` or `5`.

**4. Verification:**
*   **Scenario A:** `t = 3`, `h = 4`
    *   Equation: `(4 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1`
    *   Calculation: `2 // 2 + 1`
    *   Calculation: `1 + 1`
    *   Result: `2`. This matches the output.

*   **Scenario B:** `t = 3`, `h = 5`
    *   Equation: `(5 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1`
    *   Calculation: `3 // 2 + 1`
    *   Calculation: `1 + 1`
    *   Result: `2`. This also matches.

Let's try another pair just to be sure.
Let **`t = 10`**. Then `t - 1 = 9`.
`9 <= h - 2 < 18`
`11 <= h < 20`
Let's pick `h = 11`.
Checking: `(11 - 2) // (10 - 1) + 1` => `9 // 9 + 1` => `1 + 1` => `2`.

Since there are multiple valid solutions, we can choose any valid pair. The pair `3 4` is simple and correct.

[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers `t` and `h` and computes `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`. The output is given as 2.
So, `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`.
Subtracting 1 from both sides: `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`.
This means the integer division of `h-2` by `t-1` equals 1.
This implies `t - 1 <= h - 2 < 2 * (t - 1)`.

If I choose `t = 3`, then `t - 1 = 2`.
The condition becomes `2 <= h - 2 < 4`.
Adding 2 to all sides: `4 <= h < 6`.
So `h` can be 4 or 5.
Let's choose `t = 3` and `h = 4`.
Check: `(4 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1` = `2 // 2 + 1` = `1 + 1` = `2`. This works.
The input format expects "t h" separated by space.
So "3 4" is a valid input.
