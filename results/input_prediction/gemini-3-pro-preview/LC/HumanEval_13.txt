The function `greatest_common_divisor` implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The output is given as `5`. This means `gcd(a, b) = 5`.

There are infinitely many pairs of integers `(a, b)` whose GCD is 5. Some examples include:
- `gcd(5, 0) = 5`
- `gcd(10, 5) = 5`
- `gcd(15, 10) = 5`
- `gcd(25, 15) = 5`
- `gcd(5, 5) = 5`

To satisfy the request, I just need to pick one valid pair. I will choose a simple non-trivial pair like `a=15` and `b=10`.
Let's trace `greatest_common_divisor(15, 10)`:
1. `b` is 10 (truthy). `a` becomes 10, `b` becomes `15 % 10` (which is 5).
2. `b` is 5 (truthy). `a` becomes 5, `b` becomes `10 % 5` (which is 0).
3. `b` is 0 (falsy). Loop ends.
4. Returns `a`, which is 5.
This matches the output.

I can also choose `a=5` and `b=0`.
1. `b` is 0 (falsy). Loop doesn't run.
2. Returns `a`, which is 5.
This also matches.

I will use `a=10` and `b=5` as a solid example.
1. `b` is 5. `a` becomes 5, `b` becomes `10 % 5` -> 0.
2. `b` is 0. Loop ends.
Returns 5.

Let's pick `a=15` and `b=10` for the final answer.
