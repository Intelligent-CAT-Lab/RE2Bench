[THOUGHT]
The goal is to find an input list `numbers` such that the function `rescale_to_unit` produces the output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

Let $X$ be the input list $[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5]$.
The function calculates $min\_number = \min(X)$ and $max\_number = \max(X)$.
Then it returns a list $Y = [y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5]$ where $y_i = \frac{x_i - \min(X)}{\max(X) - \min(X)}$.

The output given is $Y = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]$.
This is a normalized scale from 0 to 1.
There are infinitely many solutions for $X$. Any arithmetic progression of 5 numbers where the first is the minimum and the last is the maximum will satisfy this, because the output is a linear transformation of the input.

Let's pick the simplest possible distinct values.
We can set $\min(X) = 0$ and $\max(X) = 1$.
Then the formula becomes $y_i = \frac{x_i - 0}{1 - 0} = x_i$.
In this case, the input $X$ would simply be equal to the output $Y$.
So, $X = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]$.

Let's double check:
Input: `numbers = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`
`min_number` = 0.0
`max_number` = 1.0
`max - min` = 1.0
Output calculation:
(0.0 - 0) / 1.0 = 0.0
(0.25 - 0) / 1.0 = 0.25
(0.5 - 0) / 1.0 = 0.5
(0.75 - 0) / 1.0 = 0.75
(1.0 - 0) / 1.0 = 1.0

The result matches the specified output.
We can also pick something like [0, 25, 50, 75, 100].
min = 0, max = 100.
(0-0)/100 = 0
(25-0)/100 = 0.25
(50-0)/100 = 0.5
(75-0)/100 = 0.75
(100-0)/100 = 1.0
This also works. The problem doesn't ask for a unique input, just *an* input. The simplest one is usually the direct mapping. I will use the set [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] or integers [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Let's stick with floats as the type hint suggests `float`.
Using [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] would result in:
min=1, max=5, range=4.
(1-1)/4 = 0
(2-1)/4 = 0.25
(3-1)/4 = 0.5
(4-1)/4 = 0.75
(5-1)/4 = 1.0

Any of these work. I will provide `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]` as it is the most straightforward interpretation.
