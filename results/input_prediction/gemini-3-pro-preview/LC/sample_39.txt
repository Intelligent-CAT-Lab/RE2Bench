The user wants me to infer the input for the function `f` that results in the output `0`.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is `0`.
2.  **Analyze the Function:** The function `f(array, elem)` checks if `elem` is in `array`. If it is, it returns `array.index(elem)`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.
3.  **Deduce Logic:** Since the output is `0`, the condition `elem in array` was true, and `array.index(elem)` evaluated to `0`. This means `elem` must be the very first element (index 0) of the list `array`.
4.  **Construct Input:** I need to create an `array` and an `elem` such that `array[0] == elem`. A simple example is `array = [1, 2, 3]` and `elem = 1`. Another valid example is `array = ["a", "b"]` and `elem = "a"`. I will choose a simple integer list.

[THOUGHT]
The function `f` returns the index of `elem` in `array`. The output is `0`. This implies that `elem` is found at the very first position (index 0) of `array`. Therefore, I need to construct an input where the `array` contains `elem` as its first element. For example, if `elem` is 1, `array` could be `[1, 2, 3]`.
