[THOUGHT]
The Python code reads an integer from the input. It then checks if the input integer `x` is equal to 1. If it is, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints `1`.

The provided output is `0`. 

Looking at the logic:
- If output is `0`, then the `if x == 1:` condition must have been true.
- Therefore, `x` must be 1.
- Since `x = int(input())`, the input string must be a representation of the integer 1.

So, the input is `1`.
