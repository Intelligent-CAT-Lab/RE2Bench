[THOUGHT]
The function `parse` takes a single argument `version`, which is a string.
Inside `parse`, it attempts to instantiate a `Version` object using this string.
The output provided is `{ "output": "<Version('1.11.3')>" }`. This output represents the `repr()` of the returned object.
The `repr` `<Version('1.11.3')>` strongly implies that the `Version` class successfully parsed the input string into a semantic version `1.11.3`.
Typically, `packaging.version` (which this code snippets resembles) returns a canonical string representation of the version.
If we pass the string `"1.11.3"` to `parse`, `Version("1.11.3")` will be called.
The regex inside `Version` will match, extracting the release tuple `(1, 11, 3)`.
The object will be returned, and its representation will match the output.
Therefore, the input `version` is `"1.11.3"`.
