[THOUGHT]
The function `waist2rayleigh` calculates the Rayleigh range based on the beam waist `w`, wavelength `wavelen`, and refractive index `n`.
The formula implemented is: `return w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen`.

We are given the output: `"pi*w_0**2/l"`.

Let's map this output to the formula variables:
- The output contains `pi`, which matches the `pi` in the formula.
- The output contains `w_0**2`. In the formula, we have `w ** 2`. This strongly suggests that the input for `w` is the symbolic variable `"w_0"`.
- The output contains `/l`. In the formula, we divide by `wavelen`. This suggests the input for `wavelen` is the symbolic variable `"l"`.
- The output does not show `n` explicitly (or rather, its coefficient is 1). The formula has `* n`. For `n` to disappear or not introduce a new symbol, `n` must be `1`.

So, the inputs should be:
- `w`: "w_0"
- `wavelen`: "l"
- `n`: 1 (or omitted, as it is the default, but the structure asks for `n` so we will provide it).

Let's verify:
`waist2rayleigh("w_0", "l", 1)`
-> `sympify("w_0")`, `sympify("l")`
-> returns `w_0**2 * 1 * pi / l` which simplifies to `pi*w_0**2/l`. This matches the target output.

The structure requires filling in `w`, `wavelen`, and `n`.

Therefore:
w = "w_0"
wavelen = "l"
n = 1
