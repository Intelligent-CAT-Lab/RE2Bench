To predict the input for `sstr`, we analyze the output `Permutation([1, 0], size=6)` and the `_print_Permutation` function in `StrPrinter`.

1.  **Analyze `_print_Permutation`**:
    The code branch responsible for this output format is:
    ```python
    s = expr.support()
    # ...
    trim = str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) + ', size=%s' % expr.size
    use = full = str(expr.array_form)
    if len(trim) < len(full):
        use = trim
    return 'Permutation(%s)' % use
    ```
    Here, the function constructs a string representation based on the `support` of the permutation (indices where the value differs from the index) and its `size`.

2.  **Deduce `_size`**:
    The output specifically contains `size=6`. This directly corresponds to the formatting `', size=%s' % expr.size`. Therefore, the `Permutation` object's `_size` attribute (accessed via the property `size`) must be **6**.

3.  **Deduce `_array_form`**:
    The List displayed in the output is `[1, 0]`. This corresponds to the slice `expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]`.
    This implies that the list is truncated at the last index of the support. The displayed list is `[1, 0]`. This means:
    *   Index 0 maps to 1.
    *   Index 1 maps to 0.
    Since the size is 6, the remaining indices (2, 3, 4, 5) must map to themselves (identity), otherwise the support would be larger and the slice would include more elements.
    Therefore, the full array form is `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This matches the support indices `[0, 1]`, where the last index is 1, so the slice is `[:1+1]` i.e., `[:2]`, which is `[1, 0]`.

4.  **Deduce `kwargs`**:
    The function `sstr` converts keyword arguments into settings for `StrPrinter`. The output logic for Permutation does not depend on the `order` setting (which controls the ordering of terms in commutative expressions like sums or products). Since the `[STRUCTURE]` requires a value for `"order"`, and none is implied by the context or necessary for this output, `null` (None) is the correct default value.

5.  **Construct the Input**:
    *   `expr`: A permutation object with `_array_form=[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `_size=6`.
    *   `kwargs`: `{"order": null}`.
