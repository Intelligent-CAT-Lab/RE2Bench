The logic requires finding three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the sum of any two equals the third.

[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int` returns `True` only if two conditions are met:
1. All three inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` must be integers.
2. The sum of any two of these integers must equal the third integer (`x + y == z` OR `x + z == y` OR `y + z == x`).

The desired output is `True`. Therefore, I need to select three integer values that satisfy one of these sum conditions.
Choosing `x = 2`, `y = 4`, and `z = 6`:
- All are integers.
- Check sums: `2 + 4 == 6`. This satisfies `x + y == z`.
The condition is met, so the function will return `True`.
