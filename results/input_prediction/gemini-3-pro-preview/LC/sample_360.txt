The function `f(text, n)` has two main execution paths:
1.  If the length of `text` is less than or equal to 2, it returns `text` directly.
2.  If the length is greater than 2, it constructs a new string based on `n` and parts of `text`.

We are given the output `"g"`. Let's evaluate the first path. If `text` is `"g"`, its length is 1, which fits the condition `len(text) <= 2`. In this case, the function returns `"g"`. The variable `n` is not used in this path, so it can be any integer. I will select a simple integer like `1`.

Therefore, the simplest inputs generating this output are `text = "g"` and `n = 1`.
