[THOUGHT]
The code takes an integer input `N`.
There are two branches based on whether `N` is even or odd.

**Branch 1: `N` is even**
If `N` is even, the output is `0.5`.
The provided output is `0.5050505050505051`.
Since `0.5050505050505051` is not equal to `0.5`, this branch is not taken. Therefore, `N` must be odd.

**Branch 2: `N` is odd**
The formula used is `(N + 1) / N / 2`.
We need to solve the equation:
\(\frac{N + 1}{2N} = 0.5050505050505051\)

Let's solve for `N`:
\(\frac{N + 1}{2N} = Y\), where \(Y \approx 0.5050505050505051\)
\(N + 1 = 2NY\)
\(1 = 2NY - N\)
\(1 = N(2Y - 1)\)
\(N = \frac{1}{2Y - 1}\)

Let's plug in the value of \(Y\):
\(Y = 0.5050505050505051\)
\(2Y = 1.0101010101010102\)
\(2Y - 1 = 0.0101010101010102\)
\(N = \frac{1}{0.0101010101010102}\)

Let's approximate:
\(0.010101... \approx \frac{1}{99}\)
So, \(N \approx \frac{1}{1/99} = 99\).

Let's verify with \(N = 99\):
Formula: \((99 + 1) / 99 / 2\)
\(= 100 / 99 / 2\)
\(= 100 / 198\)
\(= 50 / 99\)

Calculating \(50 / 99\):
\(50 \div 99 \approx 0.5050505050505051...\)

The calculation matches the provided output exactly.
Since 99 is an odd number, the `else` branch is executed, which fits the logic.

Therefore, the input `N` is 99.
