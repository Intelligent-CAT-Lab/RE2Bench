[THOUGHT]
The user wants to find inputs `interval`, `val`, and `rtol` such that `_interval_contains_close` returns `True`.

1.  **Analyze the function:**
    -   It unpacks `interval` into `a` and `b`.
    -   It sorts `a` and `b` so `a` is the smaller one.
    -   It redefines `rtol` as `(b - a) * rtol`. Note that `rtol` is passed as an argument (default 1e-10).
    -   It checks if `val` is inside `[a - rtol, b + rtol]`.

2.  **Determine constraints:**
    -   `interval` must be a tuple/list of two numbers.
    -   `val` must be a number.
    -   The condition `a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol` must be true.

3.  **Synthesize simple inputs:**
    -   Let's pick a simple interval: `interval = (1.0, 2.0)`.
    -   Here `a=1.0`, `b=2.0`. Width is `1.0`.
    -   Let's pick a standard `val` that is clearly inside, say `1.5`.
    -   Let's pick an `rtol` value, say `0.1` (although it's optional, the structure asks for `rtol`). If we leave `rtol` as provided in `kwargs` or explicit `args`, we need to fill the XXX. Let's provide a specific one to be safe. E.g., `1e-5`.
    -   Check: `rtol` becomes `(2.0 - 1.0) * 1e-5 = 1e-5`.
    -   Condition: `1.0 - 0.00001 <= 1.5 <= 2.0 + 0.00001`. `0.99999 <= 1.5 <= 2.00001`. This is True.

4.  **Consider edge cases (close boundaries):**
    -   What if `val` is slightly outside but within tolerance?
    -   `interval = (0, 10)`. width = 10. `rtol` arg = 0.1.
    -   effective `rtol` = 10 * 0.1 = 1.0.
    -   Range becomes `[0-1, 10+1] = [-1, 11]`.
    -   If `val = 11`, it returns True.

5.  **Selecting inputs to fill the structure:**
    -   Use simple integers or floats.
    -   `interval`: `[0, 10]`
    -   `val`: `5` (safely inside)
    -   `rtol`: `1e-10` (default-ish, or small value)

    Let's verify with:
    `interval` = `[10, 20]`
    `val` = `15`
    `rtol` = `1e-5`
    
    `a=10, b=20`.
    `rtol_val` = `(20-10) * 1e-5 = 1e-4`.
    Check: `10 - 0.0001 <= 15 <= 20 + 0.0001`. True.

    Let's try a case where `val` is exactly on the boundary, or just `val` inside standard interval. The easiest "True" case is `val` strictly inside `interval`.

    Inputs:
    - interval: `[0, 1]`
    - val: `0.5`
    - rtol: `0.1`

    Calculation:
    - a=0, b=1.
    - rtol = (1-0)*0.1 = 0.1.
    - Range: [-0.1, 1.1].
    - 0.5 is in range. Returns True.

    Let's format this into JSON.
