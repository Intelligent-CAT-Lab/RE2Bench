[THOUGHT]
The function `change_base(x, base)` converts the integer `x` into a string representation in the given `base`. The algorithm works by repeatedly taking the modulo of `x` by `base` and prepending it to the result string, then updating `x` by floor dividing it by `base`.

The output provided is the string `"4"`.

We need to find an integer `x` and an integer `base` such that when `x` is converted to that base, the result is "4".

Let's break down the execution for an output of "4":
1. The loop runs at least once because the output is not empty (assuming `x > 0`).
2. Inside the loop: `ret = str(x % base) + ret`.
3. For the final string to be just "4", the loop must run exactly once, or run multiple times where previous iterations produced an empty string (impossible) or previous remainders were somehow cleared (impossible). Or, simpler: the loop runs once, `x % base` is 4.
4. If the loop runs once:
   - `str(x % base)` is "4", so `x % base == 4`.
   - `x // base` becomes 0 (to stop the loop). implying `x < base`.

So we need to find `x` and `base` such that:
- `x < base`
- `x % base == 4` (which implies `x == 4` since `x < base`)
- `base > 4` (for the digit 4 to be valid in that base)

Let's try a simple case.
If `x = 4`.
We need a `base > 4`. Let's pick `base = 5`.
Trace:
- `x = 4`, `base = 5`, `ret = ''`
- `x > 0` is true.
- `x % base` -> `4 % 5` is `4`. `ret` becomes "4".
- `x //= base` -> `4 // 5` is `0`.
- Loop terminates. Returns "4".

This works. 
We could pick `base = 10` as well.
Trace:
- `x = 4`, `base = 10`
- `ret` becomes "4". `x` becomes 0. Returns "4".

Since any `base > 4` with `x = 4` works, I will choose common values. `x=4` and `base=10` is a very standard choice.

Let's verify.
Input: `x=4`, `base=10`.
1. `ret = ''`
2. `x > 0`: `4 > 0` (True)
3. `ret = str(4 % 10) + ''` -> `ret = "4"`
4. `x //= 10` -> `x = 0`
5. `x > 0` (False). Loop ends.
6. Return "4".

The output matches.

Another possibility:
Perhaps the output of multiple iterations produced "4"?
If the loop ran twice:
`ret` ends up as `d2 + d1`. For `ret` to be "4", it implies a single digit.
So the number `x` itself must be equal to 4 in base 10, and the base must be greater than 4.

I will use `x=4` and `base=5`.
