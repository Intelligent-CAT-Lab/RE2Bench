The function `f(num)` takes a list `num` as input.
It calculates `num[-1]`, which is the last element of the list.
It then appends this last element to the end of the list `num`.
Finally, it returns the modified list.

Given output: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`

Let's reverse the steps:
1. The return value is the list *after* the operation. So, expected output = `num_final`.
2. `num_final` is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
3. The operation was `num.append(num[-1])`. This means the last element of `num_final` was added by the function.
4. The last element of `num_final` is `1`.
5. Before this append happened, the list must have been `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`.
6. Does this input produce the output?
   - Input: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`
   - `num[-1]` is `1`.
   - `num.append(1)` makes the list `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
   - Returns `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
   - This matches the given output.

Therefore, the input `num` was `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`.
