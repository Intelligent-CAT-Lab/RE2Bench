To generate the output `"ceiling(x) >= x"`, the `__ge__` method of the `ceiling` class must return a `Ge` (GreaterThan) relational object with `ceiling(x)` as the left-hand side and `x` as the right-hand side.

The definition of `__ge__` is:
```python
    def __ge__(self, other):
        if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real:
            return S.true
        if other is S.NegativeInfinity and self.is_real:
            return S.true
        return Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)
```

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output string `ceiling(x) >= x` corresponds to the string representation of `Ge(ceiling(x), x, evaluate=False)`.
2.  **Determine `self`:** For the LHS to be `ceiling(x)`, the `self` object instance on which `__ge__` is called must be `ceiling(x)`. Its argument is `x`.
3.  **Determine `other`:** For the RHS to be `x`, the `other` argument processed by `__ge__` (and subsequently `Ge`) must be `x`.
4.  **Check Internal Logic:**
    *   `self.args[0]` is `x`.
    *   If `other` is the symbol `x`:
        *   `self.args[0] == other` is True.
        *   The condition `other.is_real` is checked. If 'x' is a generic symbol (default assumptions), `is_real` is `None` (falsy). The `if` condition fails.
        *   The code proceeds to return `Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)`, which matches the output.
    *   If `other` is the string `"x"`:
        *   `self.args[0] == other` is False (Symbol vs String).
        *   The code proceeds to call `Ge(self, "x", evaluate=False)`. `Ge` (via `Relational`) sympifies `"x"` to `Symbol('x')`. This also results in `ceiling(x) >= x`.
5.  **Conclusion on Input:** Since `other` represents the symbol `x`, and JSON inputs typically represent symbolic variables as strings when explicit object construction isn't available in the format, `"x"` is the correct value for the `other` argument.
