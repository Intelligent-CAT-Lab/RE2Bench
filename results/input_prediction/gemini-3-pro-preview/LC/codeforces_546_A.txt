The Python script takes three integers as input: `k`, `n`, and `w`.
- `k`: The cost of the first banana.
- `n`: The initial amount of money the soldier has.
- `w`: The number of bananas he wants to buy.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1. It calculates the total cost of `w` bananas. The cost of the `i`-th banana is `k * i`.
2. `sum` accumulates the total cost: `sum = k*1 + k*2 + ... + k*w`. This is an arithmetic progression sum: `sum = k * (w * (w + 1)) / 2`.
3. If `sum <= n` (the soldier has enough money), it prints `0`.
4. Otherwise, it prints the amount he needs to borrow: `sum - n`.

The given output is `0`.
This means the condition `sum <= n` must be true.
I need to find values for `k, n, w` such that the total cost of bananas is less than or equal to the money available.

Let's pick simple values.
Let `k = 3` (cost of first banana).
Let `w = 2` (wants 2 bananas).
The total cost `sum` would be `3*1 + 3*2 = 3 + 6 = 9`.
For the output to be `0`, `n` (money he has) must be greater than or equal to `9`.
Let `n = 10`.

Let's verify:
Input: "3 10 2"
k=3, n=10, w=2
Loop i=1: sum += 3*1 -> sum=3
Loop i=2: sum += 3*2 -> sum=3+6=9
Is 9 <= 10? Yes.
Print 0.

This matches the desired output. Note that many inputs could produce this output (e.g., "1 100 1", "2 20 3", etc.). The instructions only ask for *an* input that produces this output.

Another Example:
k=1, w=1 -> sum = 1.
n=1.
Input: "1 1 1"
Output: 0.

Let's use "3 17 4" as a slightly more complex valid example.
k=3, w=4.
sum = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3*3 + 3*4 = 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30.
n must be >= 30.
Let n=30.
Output: 0.

Let's stick to the first simple one: `3 10 2` implies the string "3 10 2".

Or even simpler.
k=1, n=2, w=1
sum = 1*1 = 1.
sum <= n (1 <= 2) is True.
Print 0.
Input: "1 2 1"

Let's use a very standard case often seen in competitive programming problem statements for testing "0" output: `2 15 3`.
k=2, w=3.
sum = 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
n=15.
12 <= 15 -> True. Output 0.
Input: "2 15 3"
