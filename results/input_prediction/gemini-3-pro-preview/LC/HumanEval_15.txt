[THOUGHT]
The function `string_sequence(n)` takes an integer `n` and generates a string sequence of numbers starting from 0 to `n`, separated by spaces.
The code executes `range(n + 1)`, which generates numbers from 0 up to `n` (inclusive).
The list comprehension `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]` converts these numbers to strings.
Finally, `' '.join(...)` concatenates them with spaces.

The provided output is: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
This string contains numbers from 0 to 10.
The last number in the sequence is 10.
Since `range(n + 1)` produces numbers up to `n`, the last number produced is `n`.
Therefore, `n` must be 10.
