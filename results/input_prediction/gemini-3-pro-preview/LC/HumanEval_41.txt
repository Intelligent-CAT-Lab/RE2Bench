[THOUGHT]
The function `car_race_collision` takes an argument `n` and returns its square (`n ** 2`).
The output given is 9.
To find the input `n`, I need to solve the equation `n ** 2 = 9`.
The possible integer solutions are `3` and `-3`.
However, typically in a "car race" context, `n` usually refers to a number of cars or a count, which implies a positive integer. Let's assume `n = 3`.

Verification:
If `n = 3`, then `3 ** 2` is `9`. This matches the output.
