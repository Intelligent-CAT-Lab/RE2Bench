To determine the input, let's analyze the Python code and the provided output.

**Code Analysis:**
1.  **Reading Input:**
    ```python
    x = list(input().split())
    for i in range(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
    ```
    The code takes a single line of input containing space-separated numbers and converts them into a list of integers called `x`.

2.  **Variable Assignment:**
    ```python
    a = x[0]
    b = x[1]
    ```
    It assigns the first number in the list to `a` and the second number to `b`.

3.  **Outputting the Result:**
    ```python
    print(min(x), end=' ')
    if abs(a - b) >= 2:
        print(abs(a - b) // 2)
    else:
        print(0)
    ```
    - First, it prints the minimum value found in the list `x`, followed by a space.
    - Then, it checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to 2.
    - If it is, it prints half of that difference (integer division).
    - If not, it prints 0.

**Output Analysis:**
The output provided is `"1 0"`.
- The first part is `1`. This corresponds to `min(x)`. So, the smallest number in the input list must be `1`.
- The second part is `0`. This is the result of the `if/else` block.

**Reconstructing the Input:**
1.  We know `min(x) = 1`. This means at least one of the numbers in the input is `1`, and no number is smaller than `1`.
2.  We know `abs(a - b) // 2` or `0` resulted in `0`.
    - If the `else` block executed: `print(0)` implies `abs(a - b) < 2`. Since inputs are integers, the difference must be 0 or 1.
    - If the `if` block executed: `abs(a - b) >= 2` and `abs(a - b) // 2 == 0`. This is impossible because if the difference is at least 2, `2 // 2` is 1, not 0.
    - Therefore, the `else` block must have executed. This means `abs(a - b) < 2`.
    - Possible pairs for `(a, b)` where the difference is 0 or 1: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`.

Let's try a simple case where `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
- `x = [1, 1]`
- `min(x)` is `1`. Output: `1 `.
- `a = 1`, `b = 1`.
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0`.
- `0` is not `>= 2`, so the else block runs.
- Prints `0`.
- Final Output: `1 0`. This matches.

Let's try `a = 1` and `b = 2`:
- `x = [1, 2]`
- `min(x)` is `1`. Output: `1 `.
- `abs(1 - 2) = 1`.
- `1` is not `>= 2`, so the else block runs.
- Prints `0`.
- Final Output: `1 0`. This also matches.

The input `"1 1"` is a valid and simple solution.
