To predict the input `lst` for the function `next_smallest` given the output `2`, let's analyze the function's logic.

[THOUGHT]
The function `next_smallest(lst)` performs the following steps:
1. `lst = sorted(set(lst))`: It converts the input list into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements in ascending order.
2. `return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]`: It returns the second element (index 1) of the sorted unique list if there are at least two unique elements. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

We are given the output `2`.
This means:
1. The processed `lst` (sorted unique elements) must have at least 2 elements.
2. `lst[1]` (the second smallest unique number) is equal to `2`.

To satisfy `lst[1] == 2`, the sorted unique list must look like: `[x, 2, ...]` where `x` is a number smaller than `2`.
Possible integer pairs for the start of the sorted list could be `[0, 2]`, `[1, 2]`, or `[-5, 2]`, etc. Since `2` is the *second* smallest, the smallest number must be strictly less than 2. The simplest integer smaller than 2 is 1.

So, a valid sorted unique list could be `[1, 2]`.
This means the original input `lst` must contain at least the numbers `1` and `2`, and no numbers between them (which aren't integers anyway), and no numbers smaller than `1` (unless `1` isn't the smallest, say `0` and `2`, but `1` works perfectly). It can also contain duplicates or larger numbers.

Let's construct a simple input list that results in `[1, 2]` after `sorted(set(lst))`.
Input `[1, 2]` -> `set([1, 2])` is `{1, 2}` -> `sorted` is `[1, 2]`. `lst[1]` is `2`. This works.
Input `[5, 2, 1, 5]` -> `set` is `{1, 2, 5}` -> `sorted` is `[1, 2, 5]`. `lst[1]` is `2`. This also works.

I will choose a simple list containing `1` and `2` and maybe some other numbers to make it generic, but `[1, 2]` is sufficient. Let's use `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` just to be safe and clear. Or simply `[1, 2]`. The prompt asks for *the* input, implying I just need to provide *one* valid input.

Let's verify input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
1. `set` -> `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
2. `sorted` -> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
3. `lst[1]` -> `2`.
Output matches.

Let's verify input `[5, 1, 2]`:
1. `set` -> `{1, 2, 5}`
2. `sorted` -> `[1, 2, 5]`
3. `lst[1]` -> `2`.
Output matches.

I will provide `[1, 2]` as the simplest valid input.
