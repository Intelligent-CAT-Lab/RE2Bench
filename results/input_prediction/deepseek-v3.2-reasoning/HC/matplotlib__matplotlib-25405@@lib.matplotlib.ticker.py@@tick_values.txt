[THOUGHT]
The output array is [1e-2, 1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3], which are powers of 10. This suggests a base of 10 and subs that only includes 1.0 (so no intermediate ticks). We set _base=10 and _subs=[1.0]. To get these exact ticks, the algorithm should generate tick locations at decades -2 through 3 (10^-2 to 10^3). The input vmin and vmax should be chosen such that after filtering, only these ticks remain. With vmin=0.01 and vmax=1000, the algorithm generates decades from -3 to 4 (due to padding), giving ticklocs [0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10,100,1000,10000], which after filtering to [vmin,vmax] yields [0.01,0.1,1,10,100,1000]. That matches the output. The computed numdec=5, and with numticks='auto' (giving 9) the stride becomes 1. The attribute numdecs is not used in the given code, but set to the default 4.
