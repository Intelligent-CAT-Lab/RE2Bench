[THOUGHT]
1. The output lut is a bytearray of length 512 (LUT_SIZE) with all zeros except the last byte (index 511) which is 1.
2. The default lut sets lut[i]=1 when bit 4 (the center pixel) is 1, which happens for half the indices. So patterns must override those to 0.
3. To get all zeros except index 511, we need patterns that set all indices to 0 and then set index 511 to 1.
4. A pattern that matches any 9-bit pattern (using dots as wildcards) with result 0 will set all lut entries to 0.
5. A pattern that matches exactly all ones (111111111) with result 1 will then set index 511 to 1.
6. The patterns list should be in order: first the wildcard pattern, then the specific pattern.
7. The patterns syntax: options (like '4:', '1:', etc.) are optional. We can use empty options.
8. So patterns = ["(.........)->0", "(111111111)->1"].
9. self.lut is initially None.
