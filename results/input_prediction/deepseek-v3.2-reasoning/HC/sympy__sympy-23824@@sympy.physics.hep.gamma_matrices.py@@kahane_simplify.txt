The output shows a TensMul object with `_ext_rank`=2, `_rank`=2, `_coeff`=1, and `_free_indices` as an empty set. This is contradictory because `_rank` should equal the number of free indices, which is 0 if `_free_indices` is empty. However, `_ext_rank`=2 indicates there are two index slots total, which suggests one dummy pair (since no free indices). The algorithm in `kahane_simplify` processes dummy contractions for Gamma matrices. Given the output's `_coeff`=1, it might correspond to a simplified expression with no net coefficient change, possibly from a product like `GammaMatrix(mu)*GammaMatrix(-mu)` after simplification? But that product typically yields a coefficient of 4 or -2 depending on the algorithm. The output's null fields for indices and index_structure suggest these may have been cleared or are not applicable in the result. Considering the function's logic and the provided output, the input likely is a TensMul with two Gamma matrices having contracted indices (one dummy pair). The output's `_rank`=2 may be an artifact or misinterpretation; I'll assume the input has `_rank`=0 to match the empty free indices. I'll construct the input accordingly.
