[THOUGHT]
1. The function `switch_backend` returns `None` (output `null`) upon successful execution, regardless of the specific backend switched to, as long as no exception is raised.
2. To avoid exceptions, the input `newbackend` must be a valid backend that can be loaded without import errors, framework mismatches, and must satisfy the requirements for `show` or `manager_pyplot_show`.
3. The 'agg' backend is a non-interactive backend that is always available in matplotlib, does not require a GUI framework, and is designed to work without raising exceptions in typical environments.
4. Given the lack of additional constraints from the output, the most straightforward and safe prediction is that `newbackend` was set to `"agg"`.
