[THOUGHT]
The output shows `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` as null. This suggests that the returned object from `_expand_partial_derivative` does not have these attributes set (or they are None). The function returns `S.Zero` when the expression has no free symbols. In that case, the returned object is a Number, which does not have `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` attributes. When these attributes are accessed (perhaps with a default of None), they appear as null. Therefore, the input `self` must be a `PartialDerivative` whose expression has no free symbols. The simplest case is a constant expression, like `5`, and at least one variable, like `Symbol('x')`. For such a `PartialDerivative`, the `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` computed during creation are empty lists. Thus, the input `self` has `_indices = []`, `_free = []`, `_dum = []`.
