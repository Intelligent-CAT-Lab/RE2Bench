[THOUGHT]
1. The function `add` returns `None` upon successful execution. To achieve this, the input must not cause any errors.
2. We choose a simple scenario: adding a new signature to a dispatcher with no existing functions. This avoids ambiguities, so `on_ambiguity` won't be called.
3. The signature should be non-empty and consist of types (not tuples) to bypass the expansion path and pass the type check. We select `(int, str)` as a straightforward example.
4. The `func` can be any callable; a simple lambda like `lambda x, y: None` suffices. It won't be called during `add`.
5. The `on_ambiguity` parameter must be callable but won't be invoked in this case. We use the default `ambiguity_warn`, represented here as a string placeholder.
6. The `self` object is a `Dispatcher` instance with default attributes. Its `funcs` dictionary is empty, ensuring no pre-existing signatures.
7. With these inputs, `add` will store the signature-function pair, call `reorder` (which finds no ambiguities), clear the cache, and return `None`.
