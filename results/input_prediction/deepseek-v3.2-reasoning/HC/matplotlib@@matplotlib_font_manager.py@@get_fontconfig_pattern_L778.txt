The output from `get_fontconfig_pattern` is: "Noto Sans CJK SC:style=normal:variant=normal:weight=normal:stretch=normal:size=12.0". This corresponds to the pattern generated by `generate_fontconfig_pattern`. Breaking down the pattern:
- Family: "Noto Sans CJK SC" (the first part before any colon)
- style=normal
- variant=normal
- weight=normal
- stretch=normal
- size=12.0

The `generate_fontconfig_pattern` function works by taking the family list and then appending key-value pairs for style, variant, weight, stretch, file, and size if they are not None. Here, there is no file component, so `_file` must be None. The family is a list; we need to set `_family` to ["Noto Sans CJK SC"] because `get_family()` returns the list. The other attributes must be set to the strings "normal" (or numeric equivalents) and size to 12.0. Specifically:
- `_slant` corresponds to style, so set to "normal".
- `_variant` set to "normal".
- `_weight` set to "normal".
- `_stretch` set to "normal".
- `_size` set to 12.0.
- `_file` set to None.
- `_math_fontfamily` is not used in the pattern, but must be present in the structure. Since it's not specified, we can set it to None or a default. I'll set it to None.

The pattern does not include any extra fields, so all values are exactly as above. No escaping or special handling needed. The method `get_fontconfig_pattern` takes no arguments, so args and kwargs are empty.
