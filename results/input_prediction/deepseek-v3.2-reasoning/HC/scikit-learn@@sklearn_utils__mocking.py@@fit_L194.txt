[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a string representation of the CheckingClassifier instance after calling `fit`. The string shows only `expected_sample_weight=True` as a non-default parameter. This implies that in the instance, `expected_sample_weight` is set to `True` and all other constructor parameters are at their defaults.
2. The `fit` method returns `self`. For the representation to match, the instance must have been initialized with `expected_sample_weight=True` and other parameters as defaults.
3. The `fit` method requires `X` and `y` to have the same number of samples, `X` to be 2D, and `y` to be convertible to an array of labels. Since `expected_sample_weight=True`, `sample_weight` must be provided and valid (length matching `X`).
4. To satisfy these conditions, choose simple valid values: `X = [[0], [1]]` (2 samples, 1 feature), `y = [0, 1]` (2 samples), and `sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0]` (length 2).
5. The `fit` method also checks `expected_fit_params`, which should be `None` (default) to avoid requiring additional fit parameters. All other self attributes are set to defaults.
