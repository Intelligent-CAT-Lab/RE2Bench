[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 2x2 list of strings, each representing a Matrix. This suggests that `to_list` returns a 2x2 list of Matrix objects, which are then stringified (likely via `str()`) for JSON output.
2. Therefore, the SDM `M` must have shape (2,2) and contain Matrix objects at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
3. The matrices are:
   - (0,0): 3x2 matrix [[4,2],[2,3],[7,5]]
   - (0,1): 3x3 matrix of ones [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
   - (1,0): 2x2 identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]]
   - (1,1): 2x3 matrix [[1,2,3],[3,5,4]]
4. In the input structure, `M` is represented as a dict of dicts matching the `elemsdict` of an SDM. The placeholders likely expect the raw data used to construct the Matrix objects (i.e., lists of lists of integers), as JSON cannot directly represent Python objects.
5. Since all entries are provided, the domain's zero is never used, so we don't need to specify the domain.
6. Thus, the input should have the given matrices represented as nested lists.
