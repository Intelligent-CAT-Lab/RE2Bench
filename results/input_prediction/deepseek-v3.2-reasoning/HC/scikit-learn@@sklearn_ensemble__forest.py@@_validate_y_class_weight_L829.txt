We need to determine the input for the method `_validate_y_class_weight` based on the given output. The output is a tuple (y, expanded_class_weight) where y is a 2D array with shape (10,1) containing values 0 and 1, and expanded_class_weight is None.

From the function:
- `expanded_class_weight` is None only if `self.class_weight` is None. If `self.class_weight` were not None, `compute_sample_weight` would return an array, not None. So we set `self.class_weight` to null.
- The function processes y by converting each column to integer indices via `np.unique`. The output y has one column and two unique values (0 and 1). This implies `self.n_outputs_` must be 1, as the loop iterates over columns.
- The input y must be at least 2D to allow indexing `y[:, k]`. Therefore, y should be a 2D array with shape (10,1). The values can be the same as the output because if the input already contains 0 and 1, `np.unique` will map them to 0 and 1 respectively.
- Other attributes of `self` are not used in the function, so we can set them to default values or null, except `n_outputs_` which we set to 1.
- The function `check_classification_targets` must pass. With y being a 2D binary classification target, it should be valid.

Thus, we set:
- `self.class_weight`: null
- `self.n_outputs_`: 1
- `args.y`: the 2D array as given in the output.
- All other attributes to typical defaults or null.
