[THOUGHT]
We are tasked with determining the inputs to the `transform` method of a selector (likely `GenericUnivariateSelect` or similar) such that the output is `[[0 1]]`, a 2D array with one row and two columns. The `transform` method selects columns based on a mask derived from the selector's state. The mask is computed via `_get_support_mask()` using attributes like `scores_`, `percentile`, etc.

To get output `[[0 1]]`, the input `X` must have at least two columns, and the mask must select exactly two columns that yield `[0, 1]` in that row. A simple scenario: `X` has three columns `[[0, 1, 2]]`, and the mask selects the first two columns. This requires the first two features to have the highest scores.

Given `percentile=50` and `n_features_in_=3`, the number of selected features is `ceil(3 * 50 / 100) = 2`. Setting `scores_ = [2, 1, 0]` ensures the first two features (scores 2 and 1) are selected. `pvalues_` can be arbitrary (e.g., `[0.01, 0.02, 0.1]`). The input `X` must match `n_features_in_` (3 columns), so `X = [[0, 1, 2]]`. The output after selecting the first two columns is `[[0, 1]]`, matching the given output.

The `score_func` is set to an empty dict as placeholder. The output config is assumed default (not pandas) to yield a numpy array. All validation passes (no warnings, correct feature count).
