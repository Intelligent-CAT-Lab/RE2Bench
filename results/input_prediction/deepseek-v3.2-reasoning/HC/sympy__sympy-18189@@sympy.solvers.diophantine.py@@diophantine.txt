The output from `diophantine` is a set containing a single tuple with three expressions in parameters `p` and `q`. The expressions are:
- First component: `-8*q**2`
- Second component: `64*p**2 + 16*p*q + q**2`
- Third component: `64*p*q + 8*q**2`

These satisfy the equation `z**2 + 8*x*y = 0` when interpreted as `(x, y, z)`. The equation is homogeneous quadratic in three variables, and the parameterization provides all integer solutions. The variables `x`, `y`, `z` are sorted alphabetically in the output tuple, so the first corresponds to `x`, second to `y`, third to `z`. Thus, the input equation should be `z**2 + 8*x*y = 0`.
