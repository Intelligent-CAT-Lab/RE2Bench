Looking at the output `{"score": -Infinity}` and the structure of the `_MultimetricScorer.__call__` method, I need to reason about what inputs would produce this output.

[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows a single scorer named "score" returning `-Infinity`. This means `self._scorers` must contain exactly one scorer with key "score".

2. For the output to be `-Infinity`, one of two things must happen:
   - The scorer's `_score` method returns `-Infinity`
   - The scorer itself (if not a `_BaseScorer`) returns `-Infinity`

3. Looking at the `__call__` method logic:
   - If `_routing_enabled()` is False (which is likely since we're given minimal context), it creates `common_kwargs` from kwargs
   - Since kwargs is empty in our structure, `common_kwargs` will be empty
   - `routed_params` becomes a Bunch with each scorer getting an empty dict for score
   - Then for each scorer, it calls either `scorer._score()` or `scorer()` directly

4. The key insight: For the output to be exactly `{"score": -Infinity}`, we need:
   - Only one scorer named "score" in `self._scorers`
   - That scorer must return `-Infinity` when called
   - `_raise_exc` must be True (otherwise exceptions would be caught and formatted as strings)

5. The simplest case: The scorer is a simple callable (not a `_BaseScorer`) that returns `-Infinity`. This would bypass the `_score` method logic and directly return `-Infinity`.

6. Therefore, I'll configure:
   - `self._scorers = {"score": a_callable_that_returns_negative_infinity}`
   - `self._raise_exc = True` (so exceptions would be raised, not formatted)
   - `args.estimator` can be any estimator object
   - `args.args` should be compatible with the scorer call

7. Since we need the scorer to return `-Infinity`, I'll use a lambda function that returns `-Infinity` for simplicity.
