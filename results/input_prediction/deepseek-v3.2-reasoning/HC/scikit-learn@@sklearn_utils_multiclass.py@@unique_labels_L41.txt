[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a sorted list of unique labels `[0, 1]`. The function `unique_labels` returns the sorted unique labels from all input arrays.
2. To achieve `[0, 1]`, the input arrays must collectively contain both labels 0 and 1.
3. The simplest input is a single array containing both 0 and 1, such as `[0, 1]`.
4. The function processes this array: it identifies the label type as 'binary' (since the array contains only 0 and 1), extracts the unique labels (which are 0 and 1), and returns them sorted.
5. The structure expects `args.ys` to be a list of the arguments passed to `unique_labels`. Since we are passing one array, we wrap it in a list.
