Looking at the output `{"_rows": 2, "_cols": 2, "_mat": null}`, this represents a matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns where the matrix elements are `null`. This suggests the function returned a matrix-like structure but with no actual numeric/symbolic elements.

Let's trace through `_matrix_derivative`:

1. The function takes `expr` and `x` as inputs
2. It calls `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)` 
3. For a matrix expression, `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` returns `_LeftRightArgs([S.One, S.One], higher=self._eval_derivative(x))`
4. For an `ImmutableDenseMatrix`, `_eval_derivative(x)` would apply `diff` element-wise to each matrix element
5. If the matrix elements don't depend on `x`, their derivatives would be 0

Given the output shows `_mat: null`, this suggests the result is a zero matrix of shape 2x2. A zero matrix would have all elements equal to 0, but the output structure shows `null` instead of `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Looking at the code path:
- When `rank <= 2` in `_matrix_derivative`, it returns `Add.fromiter([contract_one_dims(i) for i in parts])`
- The `contract_one_dims` function handles identity matrices (1x1) and matrix multiplication
- If the derivative is zero throughout, we might get a `ZeroMatrix` or similar structure

The key insight: for the output to be a 2x2 matrix with `null` elements, the input `expr` must be a 2x2 matrix whose elements don't depend on `x`, making the derivative a zero matrix. The `null` in `_mat` suggests it's not storing explicit zero values.

[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows a 2x2 matrix structure with `_mat: null`. This represents a zero matrix of shape (2,2).
2. For `_matrix_derivative` to return a zero matrix, the input `expr` must be a 2x2 matrix whose elements don't depend on the differentiation variable `x`.
3. Looking at the code flow: `expr._eval_derivative(x)` would compute element-wise derivatives. If matrix elements are constants or symbols independent of `x`, their derivatives are 0.
4. The `_mat: null` in output suggests the result is a special zero matrix representation rather than an explicit matrix with zero elements.
5. Therefore, `expr` should be a 2x2 matrix with elements that don't contain `x`, and `x` should be a symbol not appearing in the matrix.
6. I'll choose simple constant values for the matrix: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (2x2 matrix), and `x` as a symbol like "x" that doesn't appear in these constants.
7. The derivative of constants w.r.t. `x` is 0, resulting in a 2x2 zero matrix.
