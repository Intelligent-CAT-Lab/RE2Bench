The output of `_get_kernel_params` is a dictionary with keys "coef0" and "degree" and values 0.1 and 3.1. This indicates that the returned parameters are exactly these two. The function `_get_kernel_params` returns a dictionary built from `self.kernel_params` (if provided) and adds parameters from instance attributes if the kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed'. Since the output does not include "gamma", it suggests that either `self.gamma` is None or the kernel does not include "gamma" in its parameter list. Looking at typical kernel parameters in scikit-learn, only the polynomial kernel ('poly' or 'polynomial') includes both "coef0" and "degree" along with "gamma". Therefore, to have only "coef0" and "degree" in the output, the kernel is likely 'poly' or 'polynomial', with `self.gamma` set to None, and `self.coef0` and `self.degree` set to 0.1 and 3.1 respectively. Additionally, `self.kernel_params` should be None to start with an empty dictionary, allowing the instance attributes to be added. Other attributes like `n_components`, `random_state`, `normalization_`, `components_`, and `component_indices_` are not used in `_get_kernel_params`, so they can be set to default values or null. The function takes no arguments besides `self`, so `args` and `kwargs` are empty. Thus, the input structure is filled accordingly.
