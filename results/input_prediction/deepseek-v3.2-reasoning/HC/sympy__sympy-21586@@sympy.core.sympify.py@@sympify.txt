[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a string representation "2500/pi", which corresponds to a sympy expression of 2500 divided by pi. The simplest way to obtain this is by passing the string "2500/pi" to `sympify`.
2. The function `sympify` has a `strict` parameter. If `strict=True` and the input is a string, the function raises a `SympifyError` because after skipping the non-string conversion blocks, it hits the unconditional `raise SympifyError(a)` before parsing. Therefore, to successfully parse a string input, `strict` must be `False`.
3. Other parameters like `locals`, `convert_xor`, `rational`, and `evaluate` are left at their default values, which do not affect the parsing of "2500/pi" into the desired expression.
4. Alternative inputs (e.g., a sympy object with `__sympy__ = True`) are possible but less likely given the JSON output format and the straightforward nature of the test case.
