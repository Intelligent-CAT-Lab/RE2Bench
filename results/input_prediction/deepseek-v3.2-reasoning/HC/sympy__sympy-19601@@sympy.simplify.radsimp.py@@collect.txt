The output is a single string "_Dummy_373", which suggests that the `collect` function returned a symbol with that name. Given the behavior of `collect`, if the expression `expr` is a symbol (or Dummy) named "_Dummy_373" and `syms` includes that same symbol, then `collect` returns the expression unchanged. This occurs because the function identifies the symbol as the pattern to collect, extracts it completely, and returns it as the result when `evaluate=True`. Other parameters can be set to defaults: `func=None`, `evaluate=True`, `exact=False`, `distribute_order_term=True`. Since the input is JSON, we represent the symbol as a string that sympify can interpret as a Symbol, and other values as JSON literals.
