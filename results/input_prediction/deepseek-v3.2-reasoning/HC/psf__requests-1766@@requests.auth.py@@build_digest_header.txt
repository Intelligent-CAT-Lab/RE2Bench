[THOUGHT]
1. The output Digest header contains specific values for username, realm, nonce, uri, response, opaque, algorithm, qop, nc, and cnonce.
2. From the output, we can directly set:
   - username = "user"
   - realm = "me@kennethreitz.com"
   - nonce = "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
   - uri = "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (from path in url)
   - opaque = "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"
   - algorithm = "MD5"
   - qop = "auth"
   - nc = 00000001 (implies nonce_count = 1 after function execution)
3. The response value "d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460" depends on the password. Given the URI path includes "user/pass", the likely password is "pass".
4. For nonce_count and last_nonce: Since nc=00000001, nonce_count must become 1 in the function. This happens if the current nonce differs from last_nonce (resetting nonce_count to 1) or if last_nonce matches and nonce_count was 0 (incremented to 1). To ensure the function sets nonce_count to 1, we set last_nonce different from the given nonce (e.g., empty string) and nonce_count to 0 initially.
5. The cnonce "53e3a9c0a7352f78" is computed from nonce_count, nonce, time.ctime(), and os.urandom(8). In a test context, time and random are often mocked to produce deterministic values. We assume the environment is set appropriately, so we only need to set nonce_count and nonce as given.
6. The method is likely "GET" as typical for such requests.
7. The url must yield the path "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass". A full URL like "http://example.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" works.
8. Other attributes like pos and num_401_calls are not used in build_digest_header and can be set to None and 1 respectively. stale is not in output, so set to None.
