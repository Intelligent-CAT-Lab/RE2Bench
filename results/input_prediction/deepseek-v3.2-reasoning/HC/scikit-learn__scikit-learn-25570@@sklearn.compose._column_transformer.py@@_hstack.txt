Looking at the output array `[[-1. -1. 2.], [ 1. 1. 5.]]`, which is a 2×3 dense numpy array, I need to reconstruct what inputs would produce this in `_hstack`. Let me trace through the logic:

1. **Understanding the output**: The output has 3 columns. From the structure, we have two transformers: "scale" and "remainder". The output indices suggest `scale` likely produces 2 columns and `remainder` produces 1 column.

2. **Decomposing the output**:
   - Columns 0-1: `[[-1., -1.], [1., 1.]]` (from "scale")
   - Column 2: `[[2.], [5.]]` (from "remainder")

3. **Analyzing transformer states**:
   - `sparse_output_` must be `False` since output is dense array
   - `verbose_feature_names_out` likely `False` (no prefixes in output string)
   - `_n_features` should be 3 (total input features)
   - `transformers_` should have `[("scale", some_scaler, columns), ("remainder", "passthrough", columns)]`
   - `_name_to_fitted_passthrough` for remainder shows it's a FunctionTransformer with passthrough behavior

4. **Reconstructing Xs input**: `Xs` should be a list of:
   - First element: 2×2 array from scale transformer
   - Second element: 2×1 array from remainder passthrough

5. **Column mappings**:
   - `_transformer_to_input_indices`: `{"scale": [0, 1], "remainder": [2]}`
   - `output_indices_`: `{"scale": slice(0, 2), "remainder": slice(2, 3)}`

6. **Transformers configuration**:
   - Original `transformers`: `[("scale", StandardScaler(), [0, 1])]`
   - `remainder`: `"passthrough"`
   - Other parameters can be defaults

[THOUGHT]
The output shows a 2×3 dense array with the first two columns appearing standardized (mean 0, std ~1.414) and the third column unchanged (2, 5). This suggests:
1. A StandardScaler was applied to columns 0 and 1
2. Column 2 was passed through unchanged
3. The transformers list had one named transformer "scale" for columns [0,1]
4. Remainder was set to "passthrough" for column 2
5. The FunctionTransformer for remainder has passthrough configuration
6. sparse_output_ is False (dense output)
7. verbose_feature_names_out is False (no prefixes in output)
