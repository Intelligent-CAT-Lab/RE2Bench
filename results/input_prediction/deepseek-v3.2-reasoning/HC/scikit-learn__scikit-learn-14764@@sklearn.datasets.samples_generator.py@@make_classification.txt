We need to infer the input parameters for `make_classification` that produced the given output. The output shows X as a 50x2 array and y as a length-50 array of all zeros. This suggests:
- n_samples = 50 (number of rows).
- n_features = 2 (two columns in X).
- y all zeros implies n_classes could be 1, since each cluster's label modulo n_classes would be 0.
Given n_features=2, constraints require n_informative + n_redundant + n_repeated ≤ 2. We set n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0.
n_classes=1 leads to n_clusters_per_class=1 (since n_clusters = n_classes * n_clusters_per_class = 1). This satisfies n_informative ≥ log2(n_classes * n_clusters_per_class) = 0.
The X values are large (~328435 and -255363) with small standard deviations (~0.5 and ~1.0). This indicates shift and scale parameters were used to transform the data. The centroids from hypercube (with class_sep=1.0) are scaled and shifted. For n_classes=1 and one cluster, the centroid is (class_sep, -class_sep) = (1, -1) if the hypercube coordinate is (1,0). After generating X_raw (standard normal transformed by random matrix A plus centroid), shift and scale are applied. To match the observed means and standard deviations, we set shift and scale per feature:
  For feature 0: mean ≈ 328435.5, std ≈ 0.5 → scale0 = 0.5, shift0 = mean0/scale0 - centroid0 = 328435.5/0.5 - 1 = 656870.
  For feature 1: mean ≈ -255363.5, std ≈ 1.0 → scale1 = 1.0, shift1 = mean1/scale1 - centroid1 = -255363.5/1.0 - (-1) = -255362.5.
Thus shift = [656870, -255362.5], scale = [0.5, 1.0].
flip_y=0.0 ensures no label flips (y all zeros). shuffle=false to keep order as generated. hypercube=true (default). weights=None (default, becomes [1.0]). random_state set to 0 for reproducibility.
