The output consists of two polynomials in the variable `cos(phi)`: `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` and `Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`. The options indicate that the generators are `[cos(phi)]`, the domain is `ZZ`, and `polys` is `false`. This suggests that the input expressions were not `Poly` objects, but rather ordinary SymPy expressions that are polynomials in `cos(phi)`. The simplest expressions yielding these polynomials are `2` and `-2*cos(phi)`. The function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` will sympify these, identify `cos(phi)` as a generator, construct the domain `ZZ` from the integer coefficients, and produce the given polys. The input `opt` is empty, meaning default options. Thus, the input `exprs` should be `["2", "-2*cos(phi)"]`, represented as strings for JSON compatibility.
