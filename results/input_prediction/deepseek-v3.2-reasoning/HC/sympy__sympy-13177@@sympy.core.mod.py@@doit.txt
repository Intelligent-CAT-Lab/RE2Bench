[THOUGHT]
1. The function `doit` returns `nan` if any of the following conditions hold: `p.is_infinite`, `q.is_infinite`, `p is nan`, or `q is nan`.
2. Since the structure only requires us to specify `q`, we can choose a value for `q` that makes one of these conditions true regardless of `p` (as long as `p` is not such that it causes an earlier return from the function, but the condition is the first one, so it will be checked first).
3. Two choices for `q` that satisfy the condition are `nan` and `oo` (infinity). Both will cause `doit` to return `nan`.
4. We choose `q = nan` because it directly matches the condition `q is nan`. In JSON, we represent `nan` as the string `"nan"` because the output uses the string `"nan"` and the input is in JSON format.
5. Therefore, we set `q` to `"nan"`.
