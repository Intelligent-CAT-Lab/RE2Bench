[THOUGHT]
We need to determine input values that produce the given output. The output is a Bunch with "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a". This is returned by `_route_params` as `res`. The method routes parameters based on `self._requests`.

- For a property to appear in `res`, its alias in `_requests` must be True (or a string that matches a key in `params`, but our `params` only has keys "sample_weight" and "metadata", so aliases must be True or exactly those strings).
- If alias is True and the property name is in `args` (non-None params), it's added to `res`.
- If alias is None and property in `args`, it's added to `unrequested` and raises an error (not our case).
- If alias is False or WARN, it's skipped (not our case).

Given the output includes both properties, both must be requested (alias True). Also, `params` must contain non-None values for both, matching the output values.

Thus:
- `self._requests`: {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}
- `self.owner` and `self.method` can be arbitrary (they affect only warnings/errors, which don't occur here).
- `args.params`: {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}
- `args.parent` and `args.caller` can be arbitrary strings (they are used only in error messages).

No error occurs because all params are requested, and no warnings because aliases are not WARN.
