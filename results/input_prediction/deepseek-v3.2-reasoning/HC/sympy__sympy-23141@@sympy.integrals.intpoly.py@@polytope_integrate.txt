The output "1/8" suggests the integral of a polynomial over a polygon equals 1/8. A simple polygon that yields this result is the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1/2,0), (0,1), and the polynomial x+y. This triangle is defined by the inequalities x≥0, y≥0, and 2x+y≤1. In H-representation, these correspond to hyperplanes: ((1,0),0), ((0,1),0), ((2,1),1). The function `polytope_integrate` accepts such a list for 2D H-representation. The polynomial is expressed as "x + y", and clockwise is false (default). The intersection calculations produce vertices (0,0), (1/2,0), (0,1), and the integral of x+y over this triangle is 1/8.
