[THOUGHT]
The output is null, indicating that the function raised an exception. The `__int__` method of Expr raises TypeError in several cases. The first check is whether `self.is_number` is false. A SymPy Symbol (e.g., Symbol('x')) is not a number, so calling `__int__` on it will raise TypeError immediately. Therefore, the input self should be a Symbol, represented here by the string "x".
