[THOUGHT]
1. The output of `_mask_nc` is a tuple with three elements: the expression after substitution, a dictionary mapping Dummy symbols to original non-commutative parts, and a list of non-commutative Dummy symbols.
2. In the given output, the dictionary and the list are empty, meaning that no non-commutative parts were found in the input expression.
3. Therefore, the input expression must be commutative and contain no non-commutative parts.
4. The output expression is `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"`, so the input expression `eq` should be the same commutative expression.
5. The `name` parameter is only used when non-commutative parts are present to generate Dummy names. Since there are none, `name` can be any value, but we set it to `None` as the default.
6. We represent the input expression as a string that SymPy can parse, i.e., `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"`.
