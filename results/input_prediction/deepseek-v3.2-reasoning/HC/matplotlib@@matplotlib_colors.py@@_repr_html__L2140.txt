[THOUGHT]
The output contains an HTML representation of a BivarColormap instance with name "BiCone", outside color magenta (#ff00ffff), and bad color transparent (#00000000). The PNG image is generated from the lut property, which depends on N, M, shape, origin, and _init. Since _init is abstract and the output is produced without error, _isinit must be True, indicating _init has already been called. Default values for N, M, shape, origin, _rgba_bad, _rgba_outside, and n_variates are used except for name, which is "BiCone". The patch attribute is not defined in the class but is present in the structure; set to null.
