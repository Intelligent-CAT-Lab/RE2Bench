[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows raw metadata with a single key "download_url": "VaLuE", and unparsed empty.
2. In parse_email, raw metadata is populated from email headers that map via _EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING. We need a header that maps to "download_url". Typically, "Download-URL" header maps to "download_url".
3. To have that mapping, we need a header named "Download-URL" (case-insensitive) with value "VaLuE".
4. Since "download_url" is likely a string field, we need exactly one such header.
5. No other headers should be present to avoid extra fields or unparsed entries.
6. The body should be empty to avoid adding a description.
7. Thus, the email data should be: "Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n" (headers end with blank line, no body).
8. Data can be either str or bytes; we choose str for simplicity.
9. Therefore, input data is the string "Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n".
