[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and output step by step:

1. We have the `_fmt_converter_call` method in the `Converter` class that returns a formatted string based on several conditions.
2. The output is `"__attr_converter_a(a)"`.
3. Looking at the method logic:
   - `_get_global_name(attr_name)` returns `f"__attr_converter_{attr_name}"`
   - The first condition checks `if not (self.takes_self or self.takes_field)`
   - If true, it returns `f'{self._get_global_name(attr_name)}({value_var})'`
4. The output matches this pattern: `__attr_converter_{attr_name}({value_var})` where both should be "a".
5. Therefore, `attr_name = "a"` and `value_var = "a"`.
6. Also, for the first condition to be true, we need `self.takes_self = False` and `self.takes_field = False`.

The `self` object needs to have these attributes set appropriately. We can represent `self` as a dictionary with these attributes.
