[THOUGHT]
1. The output of `as_ordered_factors` is a list of strings `['w', 'z']`, representing two symbolic factors.
2. The method works by splitting the Mul's arguments into commutative and noncommutative parts, sorting the commutative part by `sort_key(order)`, and concatenating with the noncommutative part.
3. To produce `['w', 'z']`, several scenarios are possible:
   - Both factors commutative, sorted order yields `['w', 'z']` (e.g., original order `['z', 'w']` with default lexicographic sort).
   - One commutative ('w') before one noncommutative ('z'), giving `cpart=['w']`, `ncpart=['z']`.
   - Both noncommutative with original order `['w', 'z']`.
4. The simplest scenario is both commutative with original order reversed, demonstrating sorting. Default lexicographic order places 'w' before 'z'.
5. Therefore, `self` should be a Mul instance with factors `z` and `w` (both commutative symbols). `order` can be `null` (default) to achieve lexicographic sorting.
6. Represent `self` as a string expression `"z*w"` for conciseness, as it captures the Mul object's intent.
