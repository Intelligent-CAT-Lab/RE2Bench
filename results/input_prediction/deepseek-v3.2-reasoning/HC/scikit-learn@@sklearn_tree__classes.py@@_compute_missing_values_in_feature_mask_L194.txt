[THOUGHT]
We need to find input values for `_compute_missing_values_in_feature_mask` such that the output is `null` (i.e., `None`). The method returns `None` in two cases:
1. If `self._support_missing_values(X)` is `False` and `X` contains no NaN or infinity values (so `assert_all_finite` passes).
2. If `self._support_missing_values(X)` is `True`, `X` contains no NaN or infinity, and the overall sum of `X` is finite (not NaN). Since no NaN/inf, overall sum is finite and not NaN, so it returns `None`.

To ensure we hit one of these, we can control `self._support_missing_values(X)`. It returns `True` only if:
   - `X` is not sparse,
   - `self.__sklearn_tags__().input_tags.allow_nan` is `True`,
   - `self.monotonic_cst` is `None`.
We don't have direct control over the tags, but we can control `monotonic_cst` and `X`. To make `_support_missing_values` `False`, we can set `monotonic_cst` to a non-`None` value (e.g., an array). Then, regardless of tags, it will be `False`. We also need `X` to be dense (not sparse) and contain only finite numbers (no NaN/inf). That will lead to the first branch returning `None` without error.

Thus, we set:
- `self.monotonic_cst` to a non-`None` value (e.g., `[1, -1]`).
- `X` to a 2D array of finite numbers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`).
- `estimator_name` can be `null` (not provided).
Other `self` attributes are not used in the method but are required by the structure. We set them to typical default values for a decision tree.

We choose `n_features_in_` as 2 (matching `X`'s number of features). This attribute is normally set after fitting, but we include it for completeness.

All other parameters (like `criterion`, `splitter`, etc.) are set to common defaults. They don't affect the output.

Therefore, the input will produce `None` because `_support_missing_values` is `False` (due to non-`None` `monotonic_cst`), and `X` is finite, so the first branch calls `assert_all_finite` (which passes) and returns `None`.
