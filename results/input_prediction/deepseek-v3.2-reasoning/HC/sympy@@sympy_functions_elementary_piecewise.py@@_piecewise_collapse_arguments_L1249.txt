[THOUGHT]
The output shows two pairs: (1, x < 0) and (3, True). The function `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` processes a list of (expr, cond) pairs, removing redundancies and merging pairs with the same expression. The simplest input that produces this output is `[(1, x < 0), (3, True)]`, as no merging or simplification occurs. Alternatively, inputs like `[(1, x < 0), (3, x >= 0)]` would also work because `x >= 0` becomes `True` when `x < 0` is already present. However, the simplest case is chosen. In JSON, the conditions are represented as strings (e.g., "x < 0") and boolean `true`.
