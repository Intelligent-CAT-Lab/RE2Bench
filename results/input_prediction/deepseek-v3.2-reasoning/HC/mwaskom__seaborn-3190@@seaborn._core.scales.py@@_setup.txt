[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Looking at the output structure, I need to work backwards to determine what input would produce this output. The output shows the state of the object returned by `_setup()`.

2. From the output, I can see:
   - `values` is null
   - `norm` is null
   - `trans` is "log"
   - `_tick_params` is a dict with all null values
   - `_label_params` is a dict with all null values
   - `_legend` is null
   - `_matplotlib_scale` has a log transform
   - `_pipeline` is null
   - `_spacer` is an empty dict

3. Looking at the `_setup` method:
   - It creates a copy of self: `new = copy(self)`
   - If `new._tick_params` is None, it calls `new.tick()`
   - If `new._label_params` is None, it calls `new.label()`
   - Then it calls `new._get_transform()` to get forward/inverse functions
   - Creates matplotlib scale with `new._get_scale()`
   - Sets up pipeline and spacer
   - Sets legend if `prop.legend` is True

4. Since the output shows `_tick_params` and `_label_params` as dicts with null values (not None), but in the output they're non-null dictionaries, this suggests that `tick()` and `label()` methods were called and returned their default configurations (empty dicts). Therefore, in the input, `_tick_params` and `_label_params` should be None.

5. The output shows `trans` is "log", so the input must have `trans="log"`.

6. The output shows `_legend` is null. Looking at the code, `_legend` is only set if `prop.legend` is True. Since it's null in output, `prop.legend` must be False (or not set).

7. The `_pipeline` in output is null, which suggests that either the pipeline wasn't set up or there's an issue. Looking at the code, `_pipeline` is always set to a list of functions. However, the output shows null, so this might be because functions can't be serialized to JSON in the output representation.

8. Similarly, `_spacer` is a function in the code but shows as empty dict in output, likely due to serialization issues.

9. For the `data` argument:
   - It needs to have a `.name` attribute (used in `str(data.name)`)
   - It should be a pandas Series (has `.min()` and `.max()` methods)
   - The structure shows it should have various pandas internal attributes

10. For the `prop` argument:
    - It needs to have a `.variable` attribute
    - It needs to have `.legend` attribute (which should be False based on output)
    - It needs to have `.normed` attribute (used in the code)
    - It needs to have `.get_mapping()` method

Given the constraints and the fact that the output shows mostly default/null values with a log transform, the simplest input would have:
- `self` with `trans="log"` and other attributes as None/default
- `data` as a minimal pandas Series
- `prop` with `.legend=False` and `.normed=False`
