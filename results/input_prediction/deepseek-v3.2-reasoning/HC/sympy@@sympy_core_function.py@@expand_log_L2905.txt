[THOUGHT]
The function `expand_log` expands logarithmic expressions. Given the output `log(2)`, we need an input expression that simplifies to `log(2)` after applying the function. The simplest candidate is `log(2)` itself, but that is trivial and doesn't exercise the expansion logic. A more interesting input is `log(4) - log(2)`, which uses the expansion of `log(4)` to `2*log(2)` and then simplifies to `log(2)`. The default parameters (`deep=True`, `force=False`, `factor=False`) work because the expression is an `Add`, not a `Mul`, so the special `replace` condition for products doesn't trigger, and the standard expansion with `log=True` performs the simplification. Other parameters could also work, but the defaults are reasonable. Thus, we set `expr` to `"log(4) - log(2)"` and keep the other parameters at their defaults.
