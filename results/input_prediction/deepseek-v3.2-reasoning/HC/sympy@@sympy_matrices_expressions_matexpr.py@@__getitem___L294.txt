[THOUGHT]
The output string "X[1, 2]" is the string representation of a matrix element access, specifically the element at row 1, column 2 of a matrix named "X". The `__getitem__` method of `MatrixExpr` handles different key types: single integer, tuple, slice, etc. For a tuple key of length 2 with non-slice indices, it sympifies the indices, checks validity, and returns `self._entry(i, j)`. For a generic `MatrixExpr` (or subclass like `MatrixSymbol`), `_entry` returns a `MatrixElement` object that prints as `"X[1, 2]"`. A single integer key could also yield the same output if the matrix has known shape and the integer corresponds to row 1, column 2, but this requires knowing the number of columns. Since the structure does not specify the matrix's shape, the most direct and general way to achieve the output is with a tuple key `(1, 2)`. Thus, the key should be `[1, 2]` (JSON array representing a tuple).
