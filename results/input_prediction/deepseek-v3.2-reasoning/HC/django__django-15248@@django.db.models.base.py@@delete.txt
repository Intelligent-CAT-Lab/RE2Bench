[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows the result of calling `delete()` on a model instance: a tuple where the first element is the total number of objects deleted (1) and the second is a dictionary mapping model labels to counts. Here, exactly one `signals.Person` was deleted.

2. The `delete` method requires the instance to have a primary key (pk) set, otherwise it raises a ValueError. Since the deletion succeeded, `self.pk` must be non-None. The input structure includes `id`, which is likely the primary key.

3. The `_state` attribute indicates the instance's state. For a deletion to occur, the instance should already be saved in the database, so `_state.adding` should be `False`. The `_state.db` may be set if the instance was loaded from a specific database; if not provided, the router will determine the database. The output doesn't specify a database, so we can set `_state.db` to a default like `"default"` or leave it as `None`.

4. The instance must be of the model `signals.Person`. The fields `first_name` and `last_name` are given but not used in deletion; they can be any values.

5. The `delete` method was called without arguments (`args` and `kwargs` are empty), matching its default behavior.

Thus, we need an instance with a valid `id` (e.g., 1), `_state.adding: false`, and a database alias (e.g., `"default"`). The other fields are arbitrary but should be consistent with the model.
