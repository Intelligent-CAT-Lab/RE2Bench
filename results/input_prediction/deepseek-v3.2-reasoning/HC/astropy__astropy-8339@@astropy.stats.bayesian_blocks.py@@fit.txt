The output is an array of four edges from the `fit` method. To produce exactly four edges, the change points must have length 4. Given the complexity of the Bayesian Blocks algorithm and unknown fitness function, exact reverse-engineering is challenging. However, common usage in astropy involves event data with `p0=0.05`, `gamma` unspecified, and `ncp_prior` computed internally. The output edges likely correspond to block boundaries from a dataset clustered around the edge values. For simplicity, assume `t` is the sorted output array (though this would yield five edges, not four). Alternatively, the algorithm could have selected a subset of edges from a larger dataset. As a plausible guess, use the output values as `t` (sorted), with `x` and `sigma` as `None` (defaulting to ones), and typical prior parameters. This choice is consistent with the structure and may produce the output if the algorithm selects all edges except one midpoint, but it's not guaranteed. Given the constraints, this is a reasonable estimate.
