[THOUGHT]
The method `_eval_real_imag` returns `True` in two main cases:
1. When the product contains a zero factor and all factors are finite.
2. When the product contains no zero factor, all factors are either extended real or imaginary (so `t_not_re_im` remains `None`), and the input `real` is `True`.

For simplicity, we choose scenario 2 with a product of two non-zero real numbers, such as `Mul(2, 3)`. With `real=True`, the method iterates through each factor: both are extended real and non-zero, so `zero` remains `False` and `t_not_re_im` is never set. At the end, since `zero` is `False`, the method returns `real`, which is `True`. Thus, the output matches.
