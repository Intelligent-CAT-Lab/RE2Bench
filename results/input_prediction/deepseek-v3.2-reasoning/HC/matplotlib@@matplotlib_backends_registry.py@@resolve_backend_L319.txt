Looking at the output `["agg", null]`, we need to trace through the `resolve_backend` method to determine what input would produce this.

1. The output format suggests `resolve_backend` returns a tuple where:
   - First element: backend name ("agg")
   - Second element: null (meaning GUI framework is None, which happens when `gui == 'headless'`)

2. Working backwards through `resolve_backend`:
   - `return (backend, gui if gui != 'headless' else None)` means `gui` must be 'headless'
   - `gui` is obtained from `self._BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK.get(backend)` or `self._backend_to_gui_framework.get(backend)`
   - Looking at `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`, 'agg' maps to 'headless'
   - So backend must be "agg" (or "Agg", but note `backend = backend.lower()`)

3. Checking conditions:
   - `backend` is a string
   - `backend` doesn't start with "module://" 
   - `backend` will be lowercased to "agg"
   - `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK.get("agg")` returns "headless"
   - `gui` is "headless"
   - Return `("agg", null)` as required

4. Additional considerations:
   - `_loaded_entry_points` could be False (doesn't matter since builtin match found)
   - `_name_to_module["notebook"]` defaults to "nbagg" in `__init__`
   - No entry points need to be loaded since we're using a builtin backend

Thus:
- `_loaded_entry_points`: false (default from `__init__`)
- `_backend_to_gui_framework`: {} (empty, default from `__init__`)
- `_name_to_module["notebook"]`: "nbagg" (default from `__init__`)
- `backend`: "agg"

[THOUGHT]
The output ["agg", null] indicates that resolve_backend returned the backend "agg" with a null GUI framework (which happens when the GUI framework is 'headless'). Looking at _BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK, 'agg' maps to 'headless', so if the input backend is "agg" (or case-insensitive variant), it will match this builtin mapping and return ("agg", null). Since a builtin match is found early in resolve_backend, the _loaded_entry_points state and _backend_to_gui_framework don't affect the result. The _name_to_module dictionary has a default entry for "notebook" set to "nbagg" in __init__, so we use that. Therefore, the input should have _loaded_entry_points as false (the initial state), _backend_to_gui_framework as empty, _name_to_module with notebook mapping to "nbagg", and backend as "agg".
