[THOUGHT]
To get output Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})), we need the product of two Terms to yield coeff=1 and no factors in numerator or denominator. The simplest is both Terms being the multiplicative identity: Term(1). Term(1) has coeff=1, numer=Factors({}), denom=Factors({}). Multiplying such Terms gives exactly the output.
