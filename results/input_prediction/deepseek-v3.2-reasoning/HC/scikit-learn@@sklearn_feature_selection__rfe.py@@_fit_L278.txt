The output shows an RFE object representation with specific parameters: estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1. The output doesn't show verbose or importance_getter, which means they likely have default values. For RFE constructor, defaults are importance_getter='auto' and verbose=0.

Looking at the output string format, it appears to be the result of repr() on an RFE instance after fitting or initialization. Since it shows the constructor parameters, this suggests the RFE object was created with those parameters.

For the _fit method, we need to provide:
- self (RFE instance with those parameters)
- X (feature matrix)
- y (target)
- step_score (optional callback)

The _fit method doesn't modify the estimator, n_features_to_select, or step parameters - it only uses them. So self should have the values shown in the output.

The output doesn't give info about X, y, or step_score. These must be chosen such that:
1. X must have at least 2 features (ensure_min_features=2 in validate_data)
2. n_features_to_select=4 means we need at least 4 features total
3. step=0.1 means during RFE, it will remove 10% of features each iteration (or at least 1)

Since the output shows the RFE object but not any fitted attributes (like support_ or ranking_), this could be after initialization but before fitting, or after fitting. However, the _fit method returns self, so the output could be after calling _fit.

To determine reasonable X and y:
- Let's assume X has n_features=10 (so 10% step removes 1 feature each iteration)
- y can be binary classification targets for SVC
- step_score could be None (not provided in output)

Given step=0.1 and n_features_to_select=4, starting with 10 features:
- Iteration 1: Remove 1 feature (10*0.1=1, max(1,1)=1), left with 9
- Iteration 2: Remove 1, left with 8
- ... until 4 features remain

This is valid. We need to choose concrete X and y values. For SVC with linear kernel, any numeric data would work.

Let me construct:
- X: 20 samples × 10 features (array of random numbers)
- y: 20 binary labels (0/1)
- step_score: None (not mentioned in output)

The output representation doesn't show fitted attributes, so this could be after _fit returns self, and repr(self) shows the constructor parameters.

Thus, the input should be:
self: RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1, importance_getter='auto', verbose=0)
args: X (20×10 array), y (20×1 array), step_score=None
kwargs: empty

Representing SVC object: Use dict with class and params.
