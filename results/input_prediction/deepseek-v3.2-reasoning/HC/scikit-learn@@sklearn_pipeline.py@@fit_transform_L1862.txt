[THOUGHT]
We need to determine the input to `fit_transform` that produced the given output. The output is a 2x4 array: [[1., 1., 1., 0.], [1., 1., 0., 1.]]. The FeatureUnion's `fit_transform` horizontally stacks the outputs of each transformer in `transformer_list`. The simplest way to reproduce this output is to have a single transformer that returns the input unchanged (e.g., 'passthrough') and set the input `X` equal to the output. Any additional transformers can be set to 'drop' to exclude them. This ensures the FeatureUnion outputs exactly `X`. 

Thus, we set:
- `transformer_list` to `[["t1", "passthrough"], ["t2", "drop"]]`.
- `X` to the output array.
- `y` to `None` (or any value, as it doesn't affect the output in this case).
- Other parameters (`n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`, `verbose`, `verbose_feature_names_out`) set to default values.

This configuration leads to `fit_transform` returning `X` unchanged, matching the given output.
