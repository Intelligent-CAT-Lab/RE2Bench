[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_eval_is_rational` returns `None` when it cannot determine if the power is rational.
2. To get `None`, we need to avoid all conditions that return `True` or `False`.
3. A common case is when the exponent is a Symbol with no assumptions, and the base is a rational number (or any number that is not S.Exp1).
4. Consider `self = Pow(2, Symbol('x'))`. 
   - `self.exp.is_integer` is `None`, `self.base.is_rational` is `True`. The first if condition becomes `None and True and ...` which is `None` (falsey), so it does not enter.
   - `p = self.func(*self.as_base_exp())` yields `Pow(2, x)` (since base 2 is not a rational with numerator 1, so `as_base_exp` returns (2, x)).
   - `p` is a Pow, so we continue.
   - `b, e = 2, x`.
   - `e.is_Rational and b.is_Rational`: `e.is_Rational` is `None`, so condition false.
   - `if e.is_integer:`: `e.is_integer` is `None`, false.
   - `if b is S.Exp1:`: false.
   - Thus, the function falls off and returns `None`.
5. Therefore, a suitable input is a Pow instance with base 2 and exponent a Symbol 'x' (with no assumptions).
