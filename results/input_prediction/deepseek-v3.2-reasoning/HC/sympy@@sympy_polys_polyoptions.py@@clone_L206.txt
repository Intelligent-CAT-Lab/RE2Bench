[THOUGHT]
The `clone` method creates a new `Options` instance by copying all key-value pairs from `self` and then updating with the `updates` dictionary. The output shows the cloned object with `"fraction": true` and `"gens": ["cos(phi)"]`. Since `updates` only contains `gens` (as per the structure), and `fraction` is not in `updates`, `fraction: true` must have been present in `self`. The `clone` method does not perform any preprocessing or postprocessing on `updates`; it directly assigns the values. Therefore, to achieve the output `gens` value of `["cos(phi)"]`, the `updates` dictionary must have `"gens"` set to `["cos(phi)"]`. The placeholder XXX in the structure corresponds to this value.
