[THOUGHT]
The function combine_powers simplifies a matrix multiplication expression by combining powers of the same base and handling inverses. The output is "X*Z", which is a product of two matrices with no scalar coefficient. To obtain this, the input must be a MatMul that simplifies to X*Z. A simple example is X**2 * X**-1 * Z, because X**2 and X**-1 combine to X, leaving X*Z. Alternatively, X * Y * Y**-1 * Z would also simplify to X*I*Z, which may simplify to X*Z, but might include an Identity in the string representation. To avoid ambiguity, choose the input with powers of X. Also ensure there is no extra scalar factor. So mul = "X**2 * X**-1 * Z" works. Check: factor=1, args=[X**2, X**-1, Z]. Process: combine X**2 and X**-1 to X, then append Z, resulting in MatMul(X, Z) with string "X*Z".
