[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 1x1 matrix with value 1.1649954, indicating a single pairwise distance.
2. Since the output is non-zero, X and Y must be different and each have exactly one row (1xN shape). The simplest case is one feature (N=1).
3. The value 1.1649954 could be either the Euclidean distance (squared=False) or the squared Euclidean distance (squared=True). Given the default and common usage, assume squared=False. Then the distance is 1.1649954, so we can set X=[[0.0]] and Y=[[1.1649954]].
4. The function expects 2D arrays; lists of lists are acceptable and will be converted to arrays. No need to specify dtype.
5. With these inputs, the squared distance is (1.1649954)^2, and taking the square root returns approximately 1.1649954, matching the output.
6. Other parameters (Y_norm_squared, X_norm_squared) are not in the structure, so they are None by default.
