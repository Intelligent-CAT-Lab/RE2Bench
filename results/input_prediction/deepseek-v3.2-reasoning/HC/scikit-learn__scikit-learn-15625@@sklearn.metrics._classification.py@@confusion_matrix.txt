[THOUGHT]
The output confusion matrix is [[9, 0], [0, 11]], a 2x2 diagonal matrix indicating perfect classification. The diagonal entries represent counts: 9 samples of class 0 correctly predicted as class 0, and 11 samples of class 1 correctly predicted as class 1. Therefore, y_true and y_pred must be identical, containing 9 instances of class 0 and 11 instances of class 1. The function uses unique_labels(y_true, y_pred) to determine the label order, which for classes 0 and 1 yields [0, 1]. sample_weight defaults to None, resulting in unit weights and integer counts. Thus, the simplest input is y_true = [0]*9 + [1]*11, y_pred identical, and sample_weight = None.
