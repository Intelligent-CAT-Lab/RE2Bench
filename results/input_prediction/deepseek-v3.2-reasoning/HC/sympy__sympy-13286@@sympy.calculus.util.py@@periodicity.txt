[THOUGHT]
The output "2*pi" is a common period for trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine. Given that the `periodicity` function computes the period of `f` with respect to a symbol, and the input structure only specifies `f`, we assume the symbol is provided separately (likely 'x' by convention). The simplest function yielding period 2π is sin(x), as the function's `period` method returns 2π for sin(x) when the symbol is x. Other functions like cos(x) would also work, but sin(x) is a minimal choice. We represent `f` as a string parsable by SymPy.
