[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 30x4 array of imputed values. By comparing each column, we see consistent imputed values: column0 ≈ 5.80707965, column1 ≈ 3.07211538, column2 ≈ 3.75545455, column3 ≈ 1.19722222. These are likely the statistics_ used for imputation.

2. The imputer's state includes statistics_ set to these values. Since each column has a different imputed value, strategy cannot be 'constant' with a scalar fill_value (but could be with an array). However, 'mean' is the most common strategy, so we assume strategy='mean'.

3. Missing values are indicated where the output equals the column's statistic. We identify missing positions:
   - Column0: rows 5, 25, 29
   - Column1: rows 3, 5, 24
   - Column2: rows 7, 13, 19, 26
   - Column3: rows 13, 16, 17, 20

4. We choose missing_values = -1.0 (a value not present in the data) for JSON compatibility, though np.nan would be typical but not JSON-serializable.

5. add_indicator is False because the output has exactly 4 columns (no extra indicator columns).

6. keep_empty_features is True (or False but no columns are fully missing, so no effect). We set it to True for simplicity.

7. copy = True (default).

8. n_features_in_ = 4 (since output has 4 columns).

9. _fit_dtype and _fill_dtype are set to 'float64' because the data consists of floats.

10. indicator_ is None because add_indicator=False.

11. The input X is constructed by replacing imputed values in the output with -1.0 at the missing positions.

12. We assume the imputer was fitted on different data, so statistics_ are given as above, not computed from X.
