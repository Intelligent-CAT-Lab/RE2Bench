[THOUGHT]
The output expression "n + n**(-n)" is already in a simplified form. The simplify function performs many transformations, but for an expression like this, most steps would not alter it. For instance, powsimp, cancel, together, factor_terms, hyperexpand, etc., would leave it unchanged because it is already compact and lacks trigonometric, logarithmic, or other functions that would trigger further simplification. Additionally, measure comparisons (using count_ops) would not favor a more complex form. Therefore, the input expression is likely the same as the output. While other expressions, such as "(n**(n+1)+1)/n**n", could simplify to "n + n**(-n)", the simplest and most direct input is "n + n**(-n)" itself.
