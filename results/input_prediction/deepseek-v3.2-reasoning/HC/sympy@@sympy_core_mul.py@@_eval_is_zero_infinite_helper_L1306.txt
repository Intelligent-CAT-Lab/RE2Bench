[THOUGHT]
The method _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper returns a tuple (seen_zero, seen_infinite). The given output is [false, false], meaning both are False. 
The method iterates over self.args and updates seen_zero and seen_infinite based on each argument's is_zero and is_infinite attributes. 
To have both seen_zero and seen_infinite remain False, every argument must have is_zero=False and is_infinite=False. 
Any argument with is_zero=True would set seen_zero=True; with is_infinite=True would set seen_infinite=True. 
If an argument has is_zero=None, then if seen_infinite is False, seen_zero becomes None. Similarly for is_infinite=None. 
Thus, to avoid changing seen_zero and seen_infinite from False, we require that no argument has is_zero=True, is_infinite=True, is_zero=None, or is_infinite=None. 
Hence, all arguments must have is_zero=False and is_infinite=False. 
Therefore, we need to construct a Mul object whose args are expressions with is_zero=False and is_infinite=False. 
We can represent such a Mul object with, for example, two symbols or numbers that satisfy these conditions. 
In the input structure, we specify self as an object with a _args attribute containing a list of objects each having is_zero and is_infinite set to false.
