[THOUGHT]
The output of _mask_nc is a tuple with three elements: the first is a string representation "sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1", the second is an empty dict, and the third is null. The function returns (expr, mask_dict, nc_syms). For the second element to be an empty dict, either the expression is commutative (which returns {} and [] for the third) or the non-commutative case results in an empty rep (which would give None for second and a list for third, but not empty dict). Since the third is null, it might represent None or an empty list. However, given the commutative case returns [], but null might be a serialization artifact. The first element's string representation suggests that the expression contains a Symbol with name '"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))"' including double quotes. That expression is commutative. Therefore, the input eq is likely sin(Symbol('"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))"')) + 1. This yields the correct string representation, and _mask_nc would return (expr, {}, []). Assuming the output's null corresponds to an empty list, this matches. Thus, the input eq should be that expression.
