The output of `get_masked_triangles` is a list of triangles. This function returns `self.triangles` if `self.mask` is None, otherwise returns `self.triangles[~self.mask]`. Since the output contains 32 triangles and there is no indication that any triangles are missing, it is simplest to assume that `self.mask` is None and `self.triangles` equals the output. Therefore, we set `triangles` to the given list of lists. The triangle indices range from 0 to 24, so we need at least 25 points. We set `x` and `y` to arrays of length 25, e.g., `list(range(25))`. The other attributes (`_edges`, `_neighbors`, `_cpp_triangulation`, `_trifinder`) can be set to None, and `is_delaunay` should be False because triangles were explicitly provided.
