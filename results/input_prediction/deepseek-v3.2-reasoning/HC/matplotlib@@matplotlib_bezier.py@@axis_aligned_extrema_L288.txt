[THOUGHT]
The output of `axis_aligned_extrema` is a tuple of two empty arrays: `([], [])`. This occurs when the Bézier segment has degree ≤ 1, because the method immediately returns empty arrays in that case. To achieve this, we can choose control points such that the number of control points `N` is 2 (linear curve) or 1 (degenerate point). For simplicity, we use two control points in 2D, e.g., `[[0,0], [1,1]]`. Then:
- `_N = 2` (number of control points)
- `_d = 2` (dimension)
- `_orders = [0, 1]` (indices from 0 to N-1)
- `_px` is computed as `(control_points.T * coeff).T` where `coeff` are binomial coefficients for degree 1: `[1, 1]`. Thus `_px` equals the control points.

This input ensures `degree = 1`, so `axis_aligned_extrema` returns empty arrays without further root calculations. Alternative inputs with higher degree but no real roots in [0,1] for the derivative are possible but more complex; the linear case is simplest and matches the output.
