[THOUGHT]
1. The function `factor_terms` factors common terms from expressions, especially from sums.
2. The output is `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`, which has a factored denominator: `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`.
3. To obtain this output, the input likely has an expanded denominator where `a**2` can be factored out. For instance, `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2` expands to `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`.
4. Consider the input expression `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`. This is a fraction with an expanded denominator that is a sum of two terms sharing a common factor `a**2`.
5. Simulating `factor_terms` on this input: The function processes the denominator as an `Add`, extracts the common factor `a**2` via `as_content_primitive` or `gcd_terms`, resulting in `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`. Thus, the overall expression becomes `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`, matching the output.
6. Alternative inputs, such as a sum of fractions or the already factored form, are either not simplified to a single fraction by `factor_terms` or would remain unchanged, making the expanded form the most plausible candidate.
7. Therefore, the input `expr` should be `"2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"`.
