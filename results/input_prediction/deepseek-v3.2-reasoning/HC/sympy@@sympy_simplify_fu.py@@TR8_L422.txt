The output "cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2" simplifies to cos²(phi) using the double-angle identity cos(2φ) = 2cos²(φ) - 1. The TR8 function is designed to simplify trigonometric products and powers. The most straightforward input that yields this output is cos(phi)**2. 

When TR8 processes cos(phi)**2 with first=True:
1. The expression is a power of cos.
2. It expands cos(phi)**2 into two cos(phi) factors.
3. Using identities, it combines them into (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2.
4. The final result is cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2.

If first=False, the same result is obtained directly without splitting numerator/denominator. However, the default is first=True, and the output matches regardless. Therefore, the input is cos(phi)**2 with first=True.
