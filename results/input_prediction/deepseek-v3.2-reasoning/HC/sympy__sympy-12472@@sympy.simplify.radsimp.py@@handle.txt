[THOUGHT]
The function `handle` processes an expression to rationalize denominators containing square roots or powers. The given output is `1/(a - b)`, a simple rational expression. 

When `expr = 1/(a - b)` is passed to `handle`:
- The fraction splits into numerator `n = 1` and denominator `d = a - b`.
- Since `n` is `S.One` and `d` is an `Add`, the function enters a while loop to handle potential radical terms.
- However, `d = a - b` contains no radical terms, so the loop breaks immediately without modifying `n` or `d`.
- The function returns `_unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d)`, which is `1/(a - b)`.

No other transformations occur, and the output matches the input. Therefore, the simplest input that yields the given output is `1/(a - b)`.

Other complex expressions (e.g., `1/(sqrt(a)**2 - sqrt(b)**2)`) could simplify to the same result, but the direct input `1/(a - b)` is the most straightforward and consistent with the output.
