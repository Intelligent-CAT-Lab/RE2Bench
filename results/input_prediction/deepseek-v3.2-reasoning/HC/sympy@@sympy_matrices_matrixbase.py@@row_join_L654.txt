1. The output matrix is 2x4 with rows: [1,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,1]. This can be seen as the horizontal concatenation of two 2x2 matrices.
2. The most natural split is two 2x2 identity matrices, because the left two columns form an identity matrix and the right two columns also form an identity matrix.
3. The row_join method requires that self.rows == other.rows. Both must be 2.
4. The special case for null matrices could also apply, but that would make the operation trivial and less likely to be the intended input for this problem.
5. Therefore, we set self as a 2x2 identity matrix and other as a 2x2 identity matrix.
6. For the _rep attribute, we use the nested list representation of the matrix data, as it is the simplest way to represent the matrix internally.
