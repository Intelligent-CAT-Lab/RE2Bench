[THOUGHT]
1. The output of _get_params contains only four keys: n_jobs, remainder, transformer_weights, transformers. All are typical parameters of a ColumnTransformer.
2. The function _get_params first calls super().get_params(deep). If deep=False, it returns that dict immediately. If deep=True, it additionally processes estimators from an attribute specified by attr.
3. Since no prefixed keys (like "transformer__something") appear, and no extra keys from estimators appear, it suggests that either deep=False, or deep=True but estimators is empty.
4. If deep=True and estimators is non-empty, we would see extra keys from out.update(estimators) and possibly from estimator.get_params. So to avoid extra keys, we need estimators to be empty.
5. The self structure includes attributes: transformers, remainder, n_jobs, transformer_weights, _remainder, transformers_. None of these naturally yield an iterable of (name, estimator) pairs except possibly transformers_ (but it yields triples, not pairs) or transformers (if it were a list of pairs, but output shows transformers: null). If transformers is null, then getattr(self, "transformers") returns None, which would cause an error in out.update. So deep=True with attr="transformers" is not feasible if transformers is null.
6. Therefore, the simplest explanation is that deep=False. In that case, attr is irrelevant because it is not used. We can set deep=False, and set the self attributes to match the output parameters: transformers=null, remainder="passthrough", n_jobs=1, transformer_weights=null. The other attributes _remainder and transformers_ can be set arbitrarily; they do not affect the output. We set _remainder to "passthrough" and transformers_ to an empty list for consistency.
7. We set attr to "transformers" as a plausible guess (since it is a common attribute name in composition objects).
