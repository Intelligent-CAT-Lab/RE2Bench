1. The output is "-I*tanh(x + I*z)". This matches the transformation of a tangent function under `_osbornei` because tan -> tanh(a)/I = -I*tanh(a).
2. Therefore, the input expression e must contain a tan function whose transformed hyperbolic argument becomes x + I*z.
3. Let the argument of tan be A. The transformation computes a = x_dep.xreplace({d:1}) + const*I, where const and x_dep come from separating A with respect to d.
4. To get a = x + I*z, one simple solution is to choose d as a symbol that does not appear in A. Then x_dep = 0, const = A, and a = A*I. Setting A*I = x + I*z gives A = (x + I*z)/I = -I*x + z.
5. Thus, e = tan(-I*x + z) and d is any symbol not in {x, z}, but since the structure does not explicitly include d, we focus on representing e. The structure shows e with nargs, so we represent e as a tan function with argument "-I*x + z" inside nargs.
