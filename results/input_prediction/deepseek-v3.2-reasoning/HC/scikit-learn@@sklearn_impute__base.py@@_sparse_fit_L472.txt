1. The output is the statistics array from `_sparse_fit`: [3., 2., 5., nan, 2.5]. This corresponds to the computed statistic for each of 5 features.
2. To achieve these statistics, consider the strategy. The values include a non-integer (2.5), suggesting either 'mean' or 'median' (since 'most_frequent' typically yields integers, and 'constant' would yield a single fill value). Both 'mean' and 'median' can produce 2.5 with appropriate data.
3. Column 3 is `nan`, indicating that for this column, there are no non-missing non-zero values and no zeros, and `keep_empty_features` is `False` (otherwise, it would be 0).
4. We can construct a sparse matrix X with shape (2, 5) that yields the statistics under strategy 'mean' or 'median'. For simplicity, we choose 'mean' (the default). The constructed X:
   - Column 0: one non-missing value 3.0, one missing (nan), no zeros → mean = 3.
   - Column 1: one non-missing value 2.0, one missing, no zeros → mean = 2.
   - Column 2: one non-missing value 5.0, one missing, no zeros → mean = 5.
   - Column 3: all missing (two nan) → no data, so `nan`.
   - Column 4: one non-missing value 5.0, one implicit zero (not stored) → mean = 5 / 2 = 2.5.
5. We represent X in CSC format with data, indices, indptr, and shape.
6. The `self` attributes are set accordingly: `missing_values` is `nan`, `add_indicator` is `False`, `keep_empty_features` is `False`, `strategy` is `'mean'`, `fill_value` is `null` (unused), `copy` is `True` (default), and other attributes are `null` as they are set after fitting.
7. The `args` mirror these: `X` is the constructed sparse matrix, `strategy` is `'mean'`, `missing_values` is `nan`, `fill_value` is `null`.
