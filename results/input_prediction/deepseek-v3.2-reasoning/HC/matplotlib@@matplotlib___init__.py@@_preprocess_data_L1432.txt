[THOUGHT]
The output is the string representation of a function returned by `_preprocess_data`. The returned function is a wrapper named `test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs`, which indicates that the input `func` likely has the same name. The default values for `replace_names` and `label_namer` are `None`, and with these defaults, the assertions in `_preprocess_data` pass. Thus, the input can be reconstructed as `func` being that function, `replace_names` as `None`, and `label_namer` as `None`. Since JSON cannot represent a function object directly, we use a string representation matching the output.
