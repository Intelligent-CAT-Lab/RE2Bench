[THOUGHT]
1. Looking at the output: `_BinMapper(n_bins=11, random_state=42)`. This appears to be the string representation of a fitted _BinMapper instance. The output only shows `n_bins=11` and `random_state=42`, meaning other parameters likely kept their default values (or were set to None/None-equivalent values).

2. The __init__ parameters and their defaults:
   - n_bins = 256 (default, but output shows 11, so must have been overridden)
   - subsample = int(200000.0) (default)
   - is_categorical = None (default)
   - known_categories = None (default)
   - random_state = None (default, but output shows 42)
   - n_threads = None (default)

3. The `fit` method returns `self`, and the output shows the instance after fitting. Since only n_bins and random_state appear in the output string representation, the other parameters likely remained at their default values (None/None/None/int(200000.0)).

4. For the input X and y:
   - The output doesn't give specific information about X and y, but X must be valid for the fit method.
   - X must pass `check_array` with dtype=[X_DTYPE] and ensure_all_finite=False.
   - Since is_categorical is None, X should contain only numerical features (not categorical).
   - Since known_categories is None, no categorical features are expected.
   - The fit method doesn't use y (y is ignored), so y can be None.

5. We need to choose an X that:
   - Has shape (n_samples, n_features) where n_samples > 0
   - Contains only numerical data (since is_categorical is None)
   - Could be subsampled if n_samples > subsample (200000), but for simplicity, let's assume n_samples <= 200000 so no subsampling occurs.

6. Let's pick simple values:
   - X: [[0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0]] (3 samples, 2 features)
   - y: null (since not used)

7. For the self parameters:
   - n_bins: 11 (from output)
   - subsample: 200000 (default)
   - is_categorical: null (default)
   - known_categories: null (default)
   - random_state: 42 (from output)
   - n_threads: null (default)

8. The kwargs is empty as per the structure.
