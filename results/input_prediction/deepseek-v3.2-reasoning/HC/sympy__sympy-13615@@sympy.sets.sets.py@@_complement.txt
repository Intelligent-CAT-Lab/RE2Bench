[THOUGHT]
We are given the output of the `_complement` method: a FiniteSet with `_elements` = frozenset({1}). This suggests that the result is a FiniteSet containing only the integer 1. The `_complement` method for FiniteSet `other` returns the set difference `other - self` when containment is fully determined. Specifically, it returns a Union of a FiniteSet of elements in `other` for which `self.contains` is False, and a Complement for elements where containment is None. Since the output is a FiniteSet (no Complement part), all elements of `other` have a definite True/False containment in `self`. The result contains only 1, so the False set is {1}. Therefore, `other` must contain the element 1, and `self.contains(1)` must be False. Any other elements in `other` must have containment True (so they are in `self`), but they do not appear in the result. The simplest case is that `other` contains only 1. Then `other._elements` is frozenset({1}). This is consistent with the output also having `_elements` = frozenset({1}). While there are other possibilities (e.g., `other` = {1,2} and `self` contains 2), the simplest and most direct inference is that `other` is exactly the set {1}. Hence, we set `other._elements` to frozenset({1}).
