[THOUGHT]
The output false from `_eval_is_infinite` indicates that the product is definitely not infinite. This occurs when all factors are definitely not infinite, i.e., `is_infinite` is False for each argument, and no early exit returns (None, None). A simple case is a product of two finite non-zero numbers, like Mul(2, 3). Thus, `self` can be represented as a Mul object with two arguments, each having `is_zero: false` and `is_infinite: false`.
