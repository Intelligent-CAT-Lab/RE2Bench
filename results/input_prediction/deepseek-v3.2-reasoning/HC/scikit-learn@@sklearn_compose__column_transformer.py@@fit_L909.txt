The output shows that after fitting, the transformers_ attribute is [('trans', Trans(), 0)]. This indicates a single transformer named 'trans' with an instance of Trans() fitted on column index 0. To achieve this, the initial transformers should be [('trans', Trans(), 0)] with remainder='drop', so no other columns are processed. The input X must have at least one column to allow indexing column 0. For simplicity, we can set X as a 2D array with one column, e.g., [[0]]. The transformer Trans() is assumed to be a valid scikit-learn transformer with fit and transform methods. Since we cannot represent a Python object directly in JSON, we use an empty dictionary {} as a placeholder, similar to how the example used {} for _trace. Other attributes that are set during fit (like n_features_in_, _columns, etc.) are not yet defined before fitting, so we set them to null. The kwargs are empty as no extra parameters are passed.
