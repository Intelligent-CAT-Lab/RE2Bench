To produce the output [0., 0.] from `decision_function`, we need `score_samples(X)` to equal `self.offset_` for both samples. We can achieve this by setting up the IsolationForest model so that `score_samples(X)` returns a constant value of -1, and then set `offset_` to -1. This ensures that subtracting `offset_` yields zero.

We set `n_estimators = 1` and `max_samples = 1` so each tree is trained on a single sample, resulting in a leaf node. For such a tree, the depth of any sample is 0. Then, `_compute_score_samples` will compute `scores = 2^(-depths/denominator)`. With `depths = 0` and `denominator = 0` (since `average_path_length_max_samples` is 0 for `max_samples = 1`), the `out` parameter in `np.divide` gives `scores = 1`. Thus, `score_samples` returns `-1`. Setting `offset_ = -1` gives `decision_function` output of `0`.

We choose X as a 2x2 matrix, e.g., [[0,0], [1,1]], and set other attributes to consistent default values. Specifically:
- `n_features_in_ = 2` and `_max_features = 2` because `max_features = 1.0`.
- `_n_samples = 2` (training samples) for simplicity.
- `_decision_path_lengths = [[0,0]]` and `_average_path_length_per_tree = [0]` for the single tree.
- `estimators_ = [null]` and `estimators_features_ = [[0,1]]`.
- Other attributes are set to typical defaults (e.g., `bootstrap = false`, `contamination = 'auto'`).

This configuration ensures that when `decision_function` is called with X, the computed scores yield the desired output.
