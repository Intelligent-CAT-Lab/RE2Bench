[THOUGHT]
The output "sqrt(2)" is produced by the `_print_Pow` method only when the exponent is exactly `S.Half` and `rational=False`. This occurs in the first condition of the method. Therefore, the input `expr` must be a `Pow` object with base 2 and exponent `S.Half` (i.e., `Rational(1,2)`). The `rational` argument must be `False`. The `self` object is an instance of `StrPrinter` with default settings, an empty context, and a print level of 1 (since the method is called during printing). The `_str` attribute is not used in the method and can be set to an empty string.
