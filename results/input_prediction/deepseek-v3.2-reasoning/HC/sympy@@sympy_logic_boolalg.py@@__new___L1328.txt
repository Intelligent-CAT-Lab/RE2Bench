Looking at the output and the Equivalent class logic, I need to work backwards from the output to determine what inputs would produce it.

[THOUGHT]
1. Output is `Equivalent(Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z))`, which is an Equivalent expression with two arguments.
2. The Equivalent.__new__ method processes arguments:
   - If evaluate=False: returns Equivalent with given args
   - If evaluate=True: processes args and potentially simplifies
3. The output shows Equivalent wasn't simplified (didn't become True/False/And), so either:
   a) evaluate=False, OR
   b) evaluate=True but args didn't simplify
4. Looking at the Equivalent logic when evaluate=True:
   - Converts args to sympified form
   - Creates set of args (argset)
   - Processes relationals (not relevant here since Q.even are BooleanFunctions)
   - If True in argset: returns And of remaining
   - If False in argset: returns And of negations
   - Otherwise returns Equivalent with ordered args
5. Since output is Equivalent(...), either evaluate=False, or evaluate=True but no True/False in args and args weren't equivalent
6. The output has two args: `Q.even(X*Z)` and `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`
7. These are different expressions, so they wouldn't be removed as duplicates
8. Neither is True/False, so they wouldn't trigger early returns
9. Therefore, the input args could be exactly these two expressions
10. For the Equivalent to be returned as-is, evaluate should be False (or True if we want to rely on the logic not simplifying)
11. However, with evaluate=True, the method would still return Equivalent if no simplification applies
12. I'll choose evaluate=False for simplicity and to guarantee the exact output
13. Args need to be provided in a way that sympify converts them correctly

Given the structure, I need to provide:
- cls: Equivalent (the class itself)
- evaluate: False
- args: [Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)]
