[THOUGHT]
1. The output is the string representation of the return value from `get_topmost_subplotspec`: "GridSpec(1, 1)[0:1, 0:1]". This matches the representation of a `SubplotSpec` covering the entire 1x1 grid.
2. The method returns `self` if `self._gridspec` does not have a `get_topmost_subplotspec` method. To get the output as shown, `self` must be that topmost `SubplotSpec`.
3. For `self` to have that representation, its `_gridspec` should be a `GridSpec` with 1 row and 1 column, `num1` should be 0 (the only subplot index in a 1x1 grid), and `_num2` should be `None` (so `num2` defaults to `num1`).
4. Therefore, input values: `_gridspec` as a `GridSpec(1, 1)` object (represented as a string for simplicity), `num1` as 0, and `_num2` as `null`.
