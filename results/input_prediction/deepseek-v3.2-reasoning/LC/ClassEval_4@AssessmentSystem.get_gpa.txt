[THOUGHT]
The output of `get_gpa` is 75.0, which is the average of the course scores for the queried student. The structure specifies three possible students: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. To achieve an average of 75.0, we can choose any student whose courses average to 75.0. For simplicity, I choose Bob, who has only one course. Setting Bob's Physics score to 75.0 directly gives an average of 75.0. For Alice and Charlie, I assign arbitrary but plausible scores (e.g., 80 and 90 for Alice, 70 and 80 for Charlie). The other fields (name, grade, major) are filled with consistent values that do not affect the output. The queried name is "Bob".
