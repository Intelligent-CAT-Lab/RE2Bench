[THOUGHT]
The output "0 + x*i + y*j + z*k" is the string representation of a Quaternion returned by `vector_part()`. This method creates a new Quaternion with real part 0 and vector parts equal to `self.b`, `self.c`, `self.d`. Thus, the original Quaternion must have `b = x`, `c = y`, `d = z`. The attributes `_real_field` and `_norm` of the original Quaternion do not affect the output because `vector_part()` does not use them and the new Quaternion is created with default values (`real_field=True`, `norm=None`). Therefore, `_real_field` and `_norm` can be any valid values, but the simplest and most likely are the defaults: `_real_field = True` and `_norm = None`.
