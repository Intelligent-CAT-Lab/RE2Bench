[THOUGHT]
The method `clean_non_binary_chars` returns `None` (represented as `null` in JSON) regardless of the input. Therefore, the output `{"output": null}` does not constrain the input. However, the method expects `self.binary_string` to be a string. We can choose any string. For simplicity, we choose an empty string, which is a valid binary string and results in no change after cleaning.
