[THOUGHT]
The function returns False when it finds a mismatch between characters from the start and end of the string. Since the output is false, the input string must not be a palindrome. Any string that is not the same forwards and backwards will work. The simplest example is a two-character string where the characters differ, such as "ab". For "ab", the first character 'a' does not equal the last character 'b', so the function returns False on the first iteration.
