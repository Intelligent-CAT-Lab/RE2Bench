1. The function `gf_rem` returns the remainder of polynomial division in GF(p)[x], using the `gf_div` function. The output `[2, 0]` represents a polynomial of degree 1 with coefficient 2 for x and 0 constant term, i.e., `2x`. The coefficients are in descending order (highest degree first), as seen in the docstring example.
2. To get remainder `[2, 0]`, we need to choose `f`, `g`, `p`, and `K` such that `f = q * g + r` with `r = 2x` and `deg(r) < deg(g)`. Since `deg(r)=1`, `deg(g)` must be at least 2.
3. Choose `p = 3` so that `2 mod 3 = 2` is non-zero and valid.
4. Choose `g = [1, 0, 1]` representing `x^2 + 1` (degree 2).
5. Choose quotient `q = [1, 0]` (i.e., `x`). Then `f = q * g + r = x*(x^2+1) + 2x = x^3 + x + 2x = x^3 + 3x`. In GF(3), `3x ≡ 0`, so `f = x^3`, represented as `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.
6. Verify with the `gf_div` algorithm: for `f = [1,0,0,0]`, `g = [1,0,1]`, `p=3`, the remainder is indeed `[2,0]`.
7. `K` must be a domain with an `invert` method. The integer domain `ZZ` is typical, so set `K = "ZZ"` (represented as a string in JSON).
Thus, the input is as follows.
