[THOUGHT]
The `__len__` method of `CamelCaseMap` returns the length of `self._data`. Given that the output is `0`, this means `self._data` must be an empty dictionary. The `__init__` method initializes `self._data` to an empty dict by default. Therefore, to get an output of 0, we need a `CamelCaseMap` instance with `_data` as an empty dictionary. The structure requires specifying the state of `self` (with `_data`), and since `__len__` takes no arguments besides `self`, `args` and `kwargs` should be empty.
