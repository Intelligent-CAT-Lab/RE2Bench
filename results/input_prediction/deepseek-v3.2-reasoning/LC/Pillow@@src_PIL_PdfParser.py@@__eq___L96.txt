[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method returns True only if three conditions hold: 
1. `other.__class__ is self.__class__` (they are exactly the same class)
2. `other.object_id == self.object_id`
3. `other.generation == self.generation`

If any condition fails, it returns False. The output given is false, so at least one condition must be false.

We can choose `other` such that the first condition fails, which is the simplest because we don't need to know the state of `self`. For example, setting `other` to `None` will cause `other.__class__` to be `NoneType`, which is not the same as `self.__class__` (which is `IndirectReference`). Therefore, the method returns False without checking the other attributes.

Thus, we can set `other` to `null` (JSON null). This is easy to represent and does not require assumptions about `self`'s attributes.

Therefore, the input for `other` is `null`.
