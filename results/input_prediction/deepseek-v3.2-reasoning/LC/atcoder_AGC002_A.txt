[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers a and b. It prints "Zero" if the interval [a, b] contains 0. It prints "Negative" if a is negative and the minimum of (b-a) and (-a) is even. Otherwise it prints "Positive". Since the output is "Positive", we need to avoid the first two conditions. One simple way is to take a > 0, for example a=1, b=1. Then the first condition (a<=0 and 0<=b) is false because a>0. The second condition (a<0) is false. So the else branch is taken, printing "Positive". Thus, input "1 1" works.
