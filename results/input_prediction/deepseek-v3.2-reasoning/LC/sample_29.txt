[THOUGHT]
The function extracts all numeric characters from the input string and concatenates them. Given the output "123314", the input must contain the digits '1','2','3','3','1','4' in that order, with possibly non-numeric characters interspersed. The simplest input is the string "123314" itself, as all characters are numeric and would be extracted to produce the same string.
