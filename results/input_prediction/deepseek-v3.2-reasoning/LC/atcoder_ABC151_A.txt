[THOUGHT]
The code reads an input string, gets its first character's Unicode code point with `ord`, adds 1 to it, then converts the result back to a character with `chr` and prints it. Given that the output is "b", we compute: ord('b') = 98. Then the input character's code must be 98 - 1 = 97. chr(97) = 'a'. Therefore, the input must be "a".
