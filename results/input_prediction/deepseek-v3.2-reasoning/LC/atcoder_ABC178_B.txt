[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers a, b, c, d from input, then computes the maximum of a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d, and prints that maximum. The given output is 56183721947132200. We need to find integers such that the maximum among these four products equals that number. One simple solution is to set a = 56183721947132200, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0. Then a*c = 56183721947132200, and all other products are 0, so the maximum is 56183721947132200. This yields the correct output. Therefore, the input can be "56183721947132200 0 1 0". Other solutions exist, but this is a valid one.
