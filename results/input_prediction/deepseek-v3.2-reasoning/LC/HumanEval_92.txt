[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int` returns `True` only if all three arguments are integers and one of the sums of two equals the third: `x+y==z` or `x+z==y` or `y+z==x`. Given the output is `true`, we need integer values for `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy one of these equations. A simple example is `x=1`, `y=2`, `z=3`, because `1+2==3` is true. All are integers, so the function returns `True`. Other combinations are possible, but this one is straightforward.
