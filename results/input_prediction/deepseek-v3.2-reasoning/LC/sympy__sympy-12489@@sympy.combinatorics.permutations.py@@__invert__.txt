[THOUGHT]
1. The output of `__invert__` is a Permutation object with `_array_form: null` and `_size: 5`.
2. The method `__invert__` computes the inverse by calling `self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`. This means the new Permutation's array form is derived from inverting the input's array form.
3. For the output's `_array_form` to be `null`, the argument to `_af_new` must be `null` (or `None`). Therefore, `_af_invert(self._array_form)` must return `null`. This most naturally happens when `self._array_form` is `null`.
4. The size of the inverse permutation is the same as the original. Since the output `_size` is 5, the input `self` must also have `_size: 5`.
5. Thus, the input `self` has `_array_form: null` and `_size: 5`.
