[THOUGHT]
The function f(text, ch) returns the count of occurrences of ch in text. Given the output is 5, we need text and ch such that text.count(ch) == 5. There are many possible pairs. A simple example is text = "aaaaa" and ch = "a". Another common example is text = "abracadabra" and ch = "a", which yields exactly 5 occurrences of 'a'. I'll choose the latter as it is a more typical test case.
