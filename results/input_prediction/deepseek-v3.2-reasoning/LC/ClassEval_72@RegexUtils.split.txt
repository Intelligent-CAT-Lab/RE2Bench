[THOUGHT]
The given output is a list of four strings: two empty strings at the ends and two non-empty strings with spaces on both sides. This suggests that the `re.split` function split the input text on a delimiter that appears at the very beginning, between the two non-empty parts, and at the very end. The non-empty strings contain spaces, so the delimiter likely does not include spaces. The simplest candidate is a single comma as the delimiter, with the text formatted as ", abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,". This text has three commas: at the start, between the two words, and at the end. Splitting on commas yields four pieces: empty string before the first comma, " abiguygusu " between the first and second commas, " kjgufwycs " between the second and third commas, and empty string after the last comma. This matches the output exactly.
