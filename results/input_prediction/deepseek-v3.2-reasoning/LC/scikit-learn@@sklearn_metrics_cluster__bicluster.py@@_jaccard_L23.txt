The output is 1.0, meaning the Jaccard index is 1. For the function `_jaccard`, Jaccard = intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection). This equals 1 when intersection = a_size = b_size, and a_size, b_size > 0. This implies that the sets A and B are identical and non-empty. In terms of the vectors, we need a_rows == b_rows and a_cols == b_cols, and at least one of the sums positive. The simplest is to set all vectors to be [1]. Then intersection = (1*1).sum() * (1*1).sum() = 1*1=1, a_size = 1*1=1, b_size=1, so Jaccard = 1/(1+1-1)=1. So we can set a_rows=[1], a_cols=[1], b_rows=[1], b_cols=[1].
