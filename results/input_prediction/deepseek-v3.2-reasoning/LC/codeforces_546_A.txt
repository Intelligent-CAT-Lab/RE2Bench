[THOUGHT]
The code reads three integers: k (cost of first banana), n (initial money), and w (number of bananas to buy). It calculates the total cost sum = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w) = k * w*(w+1)/2. If sum <= n, it outputs 0; otherwise, it outputs sum - n. The given output is 0, so we need any input (k, n, w) such that sum <= n. Many possibilities exist. For simplicity and to ensure a valid output of 0, I choose k=1, w=1 (so sum=1) and n=1 (so sum == n). This yields the input string "1 1 1".
