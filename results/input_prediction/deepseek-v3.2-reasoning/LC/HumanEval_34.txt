[THOUGHT]
The function `unique` takes a list `l`, converts it to a set (removing duplicates), then converts back to a list and sorts it in ascending order. The given output is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, which is sorted and contains only unique numbers. Therefore, the input list must contain exactly these numbers (no other numbers) because any extra distinct number would appear in the output. The input may contain duplicates and may be in any order. The simplest input that produces this output is the list itself, which is already sorted and without duplicates. Thus, we choose `l = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
