The function `maximum(arr, k)` sorts `arr` in ascending order and returns the last `k` elements (`arr[-k:]`). The given output is `[-4, 4]`, a list of two integers. This means that after sorting, the last two elements of `arr` are -4 and 4, and `k` must be such that `arr[-k:]` yields exactly these two elements. 

Consider possibilities:
1. If `k = 2`, then the sorted array's last two elements are -4 and 4. The simplest array satisfying this is `[-4, 4]` (or any permutation, since sorting gives `[-4, 4]`). Arrays with more elements (e.g., `[-5, -4, 4]`) also work if all other elements are ≤ -4, ensuring the two largest are -4 and 4.
2. If `k > 2` and `arr` has exactly two elements (e.g., `[-4, 4]`), then `arr[-k:]` returns the entire sorted array `[-4, 4]` for any `k ≥ 2`. However, `k = 1` would give `[4]`, not matching.

Choosing the simplest input: `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`. This yields sorted array `[-4, 4]` and `arr[-2:] = [-4, 4]`, matching the output.
