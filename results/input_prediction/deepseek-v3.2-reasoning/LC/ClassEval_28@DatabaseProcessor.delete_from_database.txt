[THOUGHT]
The method `delete_from_database` deletes rows from an SQLite database table based on a name condition. It returns nothing, so the output is always `None` (represented as `null` in JSON). Therefore, the output `null` does not provide any information about the specific inputs used. However, for the method to execute without error, the database must exist and be accessible, the table must exist, and the name parameter can be any string. Since we need to predict the input values, we can choose plausible example values. I will choose typical placeholder values: database_name = "example.db", table_name = "users", name = "Alice".
