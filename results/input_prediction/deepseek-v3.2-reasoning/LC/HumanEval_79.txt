[THOUGHT]
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes a decimal integer `decimal` and returns a string formatted as 'db' + binary representation + 'db'. The given output is "db0db". This implies that the binary representation part is "0". The binary representation of an integer `n` is obtained via `bin(n)[2:]`, which for `n=0` gives '0'. Therefore, the input decimal must be 0. Let's verify: `decimal_to_binary(0)` computes `bin(0)` which is '0b0', so `bin(0)[2:]` is '0', and the concatenation yields 'db' + '0' + 'db' = "db0db". This matches the output.
