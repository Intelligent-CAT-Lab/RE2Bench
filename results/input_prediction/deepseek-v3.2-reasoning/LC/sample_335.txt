[THOUGHT]
The function f(text, to_remove) converts text to a list, then if to_remove is in the list, it finds its first index, removes it, inserts '?' at that index, and then removes the first '?'. The net effect depends on whether there is a '?' before the first occurrence of to_remove. Given the output "sjbrfqmw" contains no '?', we can deduce that either to_remove is not in text (so output equals text) or to_remove is in text and there is no '?' before its first occurrence (so output is text with first occurrence of to_remove removed), or to_remove is '?' and there is no other '?' before it (same as removal). To produce a non-trivial input where the function actually performs the removal, we assume to_remove is in text. Then text must be of length 9, and output is text with one character removed. Many pairs satisfy this. However, considering the function's special handling of '?', a plausible test case involves a '?' in the text. If we set to_remove = '?', and text contains a '?', then the function will remove that '?'. To match the output, we can insert '?' into the output at any position. Choosing a position that seems natural, e.g., in the middle, gives text = "sjbrf?qmw". This yields the correct output when to_remove = '?'. Therefore, the input is likely text = "sjbrf?qmw", to_remove = "?".
