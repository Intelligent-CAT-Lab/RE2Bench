[THOUGHT]
The function `bf` returns a tuple of planets between the two given planets in the solar system order. An empty tuple (represented as `[]` in JSON) is returned in three cases:
1. Either planet is not in the predefined list.
2. The two planets are the same.
3. The two planets are adjacent in the order (so there are no planets between them).

Given that the output is empty, we can choose any of these. For simplicity and to demonstrate the intended functionality, we choose two adjacent planets. For example, "Mercury" and "Venus" are adjacent. Checking: planet1_index = 0, planet2_index = 1, the slice planet_names[1:1] is empty. Thus the output is an empty tuple.
