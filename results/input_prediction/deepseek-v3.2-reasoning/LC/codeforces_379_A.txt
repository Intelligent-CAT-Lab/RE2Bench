[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers `a` and `b`. It computes `h` which represents the total number of candles burned, starting with `a` candles and being able to exchange `b` stubs for a new candle. The formula derived is `h = a + floor((a-1)/(b-1))` for `b > 1`. Given output `h = 80`, we need to find integer pairs `(a, b)` satisfying this equation. There are multiple solutions, but the pair with minimal `a` and small `b` is `(54, 3)`. Verification shows that with `a=54` and `b=3`, the code indeed outputs 80.
