[THOUGHT]
The output is "g", a single character. The function returns the input text unchanged if its length is ≤ 2. For output to be exactly "g", the text must be "g" (length 1). If the text were longer than 2, the output length would be at least len(text)-1 ≥ 2, so it cannot be a single character. If the text were length 2, the output would be that two-character string. Therefore, text must be "g". The parameter n is not used when len(text) ≤ 2, so n can be any value. Choosing n=1 as a simple integer.
