[THOUGHT]
The method `update_currency_rate` returns `None` (JSON `null`) only if the currency is found in `self.rates`. Therefore, the input must have `currency` as one of the keys in `self.rates`. The structure for `self.rates` includes eight currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CNY, KRW. We need to assign values to each. I will use the initial rates from the `__init__` method for the first seven, and for KRW (which is not initially present) I will choose an arbitrary value, say 1200.0. For the arguments, I will choose a currency that is in the dictionary, e.g., "EUR", and a new_rate, e.g., 0.9. This will result in the method updating the rate and returning `None`, matching the output.
