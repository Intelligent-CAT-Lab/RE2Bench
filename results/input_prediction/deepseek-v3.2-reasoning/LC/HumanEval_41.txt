[THOUGHT]
The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` and returns `n ** 2`. The given output is 9. We need to find an integer `n` such that `n ** 2 = 9`. Solving this equation gives two possible solutions: `n = 3` and `n = -3`. However, considering the function name "car_race_collision", it likely models a scenario involving a number of cars, where `n` would be a non-negative count. Therefore, we choose `n = 3`. Plugging `n = 3` into the function yields `3 ** 2 = 9`, matching the output.
