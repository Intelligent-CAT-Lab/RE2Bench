[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `{"output": null}`, which suggests the function might have raised an exception and the test framework captured it as `null`. 
2. The function `morsel_to_cookie` can raise a `TypeError` if `morsel['max-age']` is a non-integer string, or a `ValueError` if `morsel['expires']` is malformed. 
3. Since `max-age` is checked first, setting it to a non-integer (like "abc") will cause a `TypeError` when `int(morsel['max-age'])` fails. 
4. Other fields can be set to default or empty values, as they won't affect the exception. The morsel's `key` and `value` attributes are not in the structure, so they are assumed to be provided by the test. 
5. Thus, the input morsel should have `max-age` as a non-integer string, and the rest can be empty strings or default values.
