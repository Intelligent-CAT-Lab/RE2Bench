[THOUGHT]
The output SQL is "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;". From the `SQLGenerator.select` method, we see that:
- The table name comes from `self.table_name`. In the output, after "FROM " we have "table1", so `self.table_name` must be "table1".
- The fields part is "*", which is the default when `fields` is not provided or is None. Since the structure only includes `condition` in kwargs, we assume `fields` was not provided and thus defaults to None.
- The condition is "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", as it appears after "WHERE ".
Therefore, the input to `select` should have `self.table_name` = "table1", and `condition` = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", with no `fields` argument.
