[THOUGHT]
The `__format_line_feed` static method replaces sequences of one or more newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline. The output is "Some sentence here." with no newlines. For this to be the output, the input must have no newlines, or if it had any, they would appear in the output as at least one newline after replacement. Since the output has no newlines, the input must be exactly "Some sentence here." without any newline characters. The method doesn't modify other characters, so the input matches the output exactly.
