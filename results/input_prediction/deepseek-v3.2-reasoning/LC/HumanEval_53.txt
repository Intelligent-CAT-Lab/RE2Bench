[THOUGHT]
The function `add(x, y)` performs a simple addition: it returns `x + y`. Given the output is 1223, we have the equation `x + y = 1223`. Since the function is not injective, there are infinitely many integer pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy this equation. Without additional constraints, any such pair is a valid input. For the purpose of filling the input structure, I choose `x = 1000` and `y = 223` as one possible solution.
