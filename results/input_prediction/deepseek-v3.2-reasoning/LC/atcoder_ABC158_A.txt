[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line from stdin into variable `s`. It then checks if both 'A' and 'B' are in the string `s`. If both are present, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No". The given output is "Yes", so the input string must contain both 'A' and 'B'. A simple string that satisfies this condition is "AB". There are many other possibilities, but for the purpose of filling the input, "AB" is a valid and minimal choice. Therefore, the input should be "AB".
