[THOUGHT]
The function `f(array)` creates a list of strings where each string is 'n' repeated a number of times equal to each element in `array`. It then returns that list. The given output is an empty list `[]`. For the output to be empty, the input `array` must be empty because if `array` had any elements, even zeros or negative numbers, they would produce empty strings (`''`) that would be appended to the output list, resulting in a non-empty list (e.g., `['']`). Therefore, the only input that yields an empty output list is an empty array.
