[THOUGHT]
The add_heading method returns True if it successfully adds a heading to the Word document at self.file_path. The output true indicates success. Therefore, we need to provide a file_path that points to an existing .docx file (or at least a file that python-docx can open without error) and a heading string. The level is not provided, so it defaults to 1. There are no constraints on the specific values, so we can choose any plausible values.
