[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_eval_expand_trig` of `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction` returns `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)`.
2. The output provided is `{"nargs": {"_args_set": "{'1'}"}}`. This suggests that the return value has an attribute `nargs` which is an object with an attribute `_args_set` equal to the string `"{'1'}"` (or possibly a set whose string representation is that).
3. Since we don't have the implementation of `_calculate_reciprocal`, we must infer the input that would produce such an output.
4. Given that the output's `_args_set` is a string representation of a set containing the string '1', it is likely that the input's `_args_set` is similar, because `_calculate_reciprocal` may return a function object of the same type or with the same `nargs` property.
5. The input structure asks for `self.nargs._args_set`. To produce the given output, it is simplest to assume that `self.nargs._args_set` is also `"{'1'}"`.
6. Therefore, set XXX to `"{'1'}"`.
