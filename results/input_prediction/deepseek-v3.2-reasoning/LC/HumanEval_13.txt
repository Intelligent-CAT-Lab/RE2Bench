[THOUGHT]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` implements the Euclidean algorithm. Given the output is 5, we need integers a and b such that their greatest common divisor is 5. We can choose any pair (a, b) with gcd 5. For simplicity, we pick a=10 and b=5, which yields gcd(10,5)=5. The algorithm with a=10, b=5: while b=5, a,b = (5, 10%5=0) -> a=5, b=0; then returns 5. This matches the output.
