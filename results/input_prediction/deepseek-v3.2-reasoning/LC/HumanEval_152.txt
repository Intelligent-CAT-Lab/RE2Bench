[THOUGHT]
The output is a list of four integers: [2, 0, 0, 1]. The function `compare` computes the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`. Since the output has four elements, both `game` and `guess` must be sequences of length at least 4 (we assume exactly 4 for simplicity). To satisfy the output, we need pairs (x, y) such that abs(x - y) equals the given numbers. A simple solution is to set `guess` to all zeros. Then `game` must be exactly [2, 0, 0, 1] because abs(2 - 0) = 2, abs(0 - 0) = 0, abs(0 - 0) = 0, and abs(1 - 0) = 1. This yields the desired output. Thus, we can choose `game = [2, 0, 0, 1]` and `guess = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
