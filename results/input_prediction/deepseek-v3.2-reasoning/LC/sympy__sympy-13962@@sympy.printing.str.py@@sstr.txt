[THOUGHT]
The output string "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)" is produced by the `_print_Permutation` method of `StrPrinter`. This format corresponds to the non-cyclic representation. Analyzing the code, this output occurs when the permutation has a non-empty support and the trimmed representation (showing only moved points) is shorter than the full array form. Specifically, the permutation must have support {0, 1}, meaning only indices 0 and 1 are moved, with the rest fixed. The trimmed representation shows the first two elements of the array form, and the size is given explicitly.

Thus, the permutation object must have:
- `_array_form`: [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5] (or any permutation of size 6 that swaps 0 and 1 and leaves 2..5 fixed).
- `_size`: 6.

The `kwargs` includes an `order` setting, but the output does not depend on it. Since it cannot be determined from the output, we assume it was not specified (or set to a default). However, the structure requires a value; we set it to `null` to indicate absence or default.
