[THOUGHT]
The function `parse_music` splits the input string by spaces and maps each token to an integer using the dictionary `note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}`. The output is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, which means each token must map to `1`. The only token that maps to `1` is `'.|'`. Therefore, the input string must contain four tokens of `'.|'` separated by spaces. A simple valid input is `".| .| .| .|"`. Extra spaces would not affect the result because empty strings are filtered out, but the simplest form is with single spaces between tokens.
