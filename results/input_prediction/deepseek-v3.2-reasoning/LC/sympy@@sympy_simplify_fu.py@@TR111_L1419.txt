[THOUGHT]
The function `TR111` transforms powers of trigonometric functions (`tan`, `sin`, `cos`) when the base is positive or the exponent is a negative integer. The output is `cos(phi)**2`. For this output to be produced, the input must be such that after applying `bottom_up` with transformation `f`, the result equals `cos(phi)**2`. 

Analyzing the transformation rules:
- `tan(x)^exp` → `cot(x)^(-exp)` (if condition holds)
- `sin(x)^exp` → `csc(x)^(-exp)` (if condition holds)
- `cos(x)^exp` → `sec(x)^(-exp)` (if condition holds)

The condition requires the expression to be a `Pow` and either the base is positive or the exponent is an integer and negative. For `cos(phi)**2`, the base `cos(phi)` is not inherently positive (without assumptions), and the exponent `2` is positive. Hence, the condition fails, and `f` returns the expression unchanged. Therefore, if the input is `cos(phi)**2`, the output remains `cos(phi)**2`.

Other potential inputs like `sec(phi)**(-2)` or `cos(phi)**(-2)` would either not match the base type or transform to a different expression (`sec(phi)**2`), not matching the output. Thus, the simplest and most plausible input is `cos(phi)**2`.

Simulating `bottom_up`:
- For `cos(phi)**2`, subexpressions (`phi`, `cos(phi)`) are processed first and unchanged.
- The `Pow` node `cos(phi)**2` is passed to `f`. Since `base.is_positive` is `False` and `exp` is positive, the condition fails, and `f` returns the same `Pow`. Thus, the output is `cos(phi)**2`.

Hence, the input `rv` should be `cos(phi)**2`.
