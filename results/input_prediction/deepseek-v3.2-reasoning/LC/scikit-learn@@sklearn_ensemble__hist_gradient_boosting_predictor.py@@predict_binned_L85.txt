1. The output is an array of 5 floats: [-3.2169443, -3.2169443, 1.74244938, 8.8096566, 14.6135011]. This indicates that the input `X` must have 5 samples.
2. The first two predictions are identical, suggesting that samples 0 and 1 follow the same path in the tree and end up in the same leaf.
3. To achieve four distinct prediction values with 5 samples, the tree must have at least 4 leaves, requiring 3 split nodes (in a full binary tree).
4. Assuming a single feature for simplicity, we design a tree where splits are based on binned feature values. Let `X` be a 5x1 array with binned values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The tree splits are set so that:
   - Samples with `X <= 1` go to a leaf with value -3.2169443 (samples 0 and 1).
   - Samples with `X == 2` go to a leaf with value 1.74244938 (sample 2).
   - Samples with `X == 3` go to a leaf with value 8.8096566 (sample 3).
   - Samples with `X == 4` go to a leaf with value 14.6135011 (sample 4).
5. The tree nodes are represented as records with fields: `is_leaf`, `value`, `feature_idx`, `threshold`, `left`, and `right`. We create 7 nodes: 3 splits and 4 leaves. For splits, `is_leaf=0`, `value=0.0`, `feature_idx=0`, and `threshold` set appropriately. For leaves, `is_leaf=1`, `value` set to the prediction, and other fields set to 0.
6. Since there are no categorical splits, `binned_left_cat_bitsets` and `raw_left_cat_bitsets` are set to empty arrays.
7. `missing_values_bin_idx` is set to 255 (a typical sentinel for no missing values in binned data), and `n_threads` is set to 1 for simplicity.
