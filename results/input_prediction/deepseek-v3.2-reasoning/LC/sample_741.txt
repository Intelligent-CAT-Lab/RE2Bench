The function f(nums, p) computes prev_p = p - 1. If prev_p is negative, it sets prev_p to len(nums) - 1 (the last index). It then returns nums[prev_p]. The output is 1, so nums[prev_p] must equal 1.

We can choose simple values for nums and p. Let nums = [1] (a list containing only the integer 1) and p = 0. Then prev_p = 0 - 1 = -1, which is negative, so prev_p becomes len(nums) - 1 = 0. nums[0] is 1, so the function returns 1. This satisfies the output.

Other combinations are possible, but this is a minimal valid input.
