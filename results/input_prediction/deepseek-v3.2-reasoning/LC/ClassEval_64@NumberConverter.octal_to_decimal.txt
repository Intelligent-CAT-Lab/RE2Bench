[THOUGHT]
The function `octal_to_decimal` converts an octal string to a decimal integer. Given the output is 21271, we need to find the octal string that, when interpreted in base 8, equals 21271. We compute the octal representation of 21271 by repeatedly dividing by 8:

- 21271 ÷ 8 = 2658 remainder 7
- 2658 ÷ 8 = 332 remainder 2
- 332 ÷ 8 = 41 remainder 4
- 41 ÷ 8 = 5 remainder 1
- 5 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 5

Reading remainders from bottom to top gives 51427. Thus, the octal string is "51427".
