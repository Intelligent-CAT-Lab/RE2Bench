[THOUGHT]
We are given the output sequence: 110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220. The code computes x_{i+1} = r * x_i - D for i from 0 to 9, starting with an initial x. The output lines correspond to x1 through x10. Using the first two outputs, we set up equations:
120 = r * 110 - D,
140 = r * 120 - D.
Subtracting gives 20 = 10r, so r = 2. Substituting back gives D = 100. Checking subsequent values confirms r=2 and D=100. Then using x1 = 110, we solve for initial x: 2 * x0 - 100 = 110 => x0 = 105. Thus the input string is "2 100 105".
