[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs c1 and c2 such that `ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2)` returns the complex number \(2 - 2j\). The method subtracts c2 from c1: `c1 - c2 = (c1.real - c2.real) + (c1.imag - c2.imag)j`. We want this equal to \(2 - 2j\). So we have:
- Real part: `c1.real - c2.real = 2`
- Imaginary part: `c1.imag - c2.imag = -2`

There are infinitely many solutions. A simple choice is to set c2 = 0 (which could be an integer 0) and c1 = 2 - 2j. Then:
- `c1.real = 2`, `c1.imag = -2`
- `c2.real = 0`, `c2.imag = 0`
- Subtraction gives: `(2 - 0) + (-2 - 0)j = 2 - 2j`

In JSON, complex numbers are not a native type, so we represent them as strings that evaluate to Python complex literals. Thus, c1 can be represented as the string `"2-2j"` and c2 as the string `"0"` (which evaluates to the integer 0). Both have the required `.real` and `.imag` attributes when evaluated.
