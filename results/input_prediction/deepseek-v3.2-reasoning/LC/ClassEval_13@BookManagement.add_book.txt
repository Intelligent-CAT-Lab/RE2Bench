[THOUGHT]
The `add_book` method modifies the inventory but returns `None`. Therefore, the output `null` (None) is always the same regardless of input. The structure requires initial inventory with keys "book1" and "book2" and a title to add. Since the output does not constrain the inputs, I can choose any valid values. For simplicity, I set initial quantities to small numbers and choose a title not already in inventory so that a new entry is added. This is consistent with the method's behavior and the given structure.
