[THOUGHT]
1. The function `setup` takes a single argument `app`, which is expected to be an instance of `Sphinx`.
2. Inside the function, `app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector)` is called, but the return value of the function is a fixed dictionary that does not depend on `app`.
3. Therefore, any `app` that allows the method call to proceed without error will produce the given output.
4. Since the input must be represented in JSON, and we cannot fully represent a Python object, we use a placeholder string that indicates `app` is a Sphinx application object.
