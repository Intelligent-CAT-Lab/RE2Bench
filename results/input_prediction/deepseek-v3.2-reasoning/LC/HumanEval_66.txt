[THOUGHT]
The function `digitSum(s)` returns the sum of the ASCII values (`ord`) of all uppercase letters in the string `s`. Given the output is 327, we need a string where the sum of the `ord` values of its uppercase letters equals 327. Since the ASCII values of uppercase letters range from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z'), a single character cannot achieve 327. The minimum sum for three characters is 195 (all 'A') and the maximum is 270 (all 'Z'), so at least four characters are needed. We can construct a simple string: five 'A's sum to 325, which is 2 short of 327. Replacing one 'A' with 'C' gives 65*4 + 67 = 327. Thus, the string "AAAAC" works. Alternatively, other combinations like "PQSS" also work, but "AAAAC" is straightforward and uses only common letters.
