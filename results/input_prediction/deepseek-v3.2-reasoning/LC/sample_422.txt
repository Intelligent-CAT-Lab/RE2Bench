[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes an array, copies it, reverses the copy, and returns a list of squares of each element in the reversed order. The given output is `[1, 4, 1]`. This means that after reversing the input array and squaring each element, we get `[1, 4, 1]`. Let the input array be `[a, b, c]` (length 3, since the output length is 3). After reversal, the order is `[c, b, a]`. Squaring gives `[c^2, b^2, a^2] = [1, 4, 1]`. Thus, `c^2 = 1` (so `c = ±1`), `b^2 = 4` (so `b = ±2`), and `a^2 = 1` (so `a = ±1`). The original input array is the reverse of the sequence `[c, b, a]`, so it is `[a, b, c]`. One simple solution is `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`, giving input `[1, 2, 1]`. This works because reversing `[1, 2, 1]` gives `[1, 2, 1]` (same due to symmetry), and squaring yields `[1, 4, 1]`. Other sign combinations also work, but `[1, 2, 1]` is a straightforward choice.
