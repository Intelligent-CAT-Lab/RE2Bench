[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify` returns True if the product of the two fractions `x` and `n` is an integer. We need to find an example where this holds. A simple example is when the two fractions are reciprocals, e.g., x = "1/2" and n = "2/1". Then the product is (1*2)/(2*1)=2/2=1, which is an integer. Therefore, the function would return True. Other examples are possible, but this is straightforward.
