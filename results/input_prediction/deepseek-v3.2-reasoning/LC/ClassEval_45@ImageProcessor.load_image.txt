[THOUGHT]
The `load_image` method opens an image file using `Image.open` and assigns it to `self.image`. It does not have a return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`. The given output is `null`, which corresponds to `None` in JSON. Therefore, for any successful call (where `Image.open` succeeds without raising an exception), the output will be `None`. The input cannot be uniquely determined from the output alone. However, the initial state of `self.image` is `None` (as set in `__init__`), so before the call, `self.image` should be `null`. The `image_path` must be a valid path to an existing image file to ensure the method succeeds. Without additional information, a generic placeholder like `"image.jpg"` is reasonable. The `kwargs` is empty. Thus, the input is as follows.
