[THOUGHT]
To find inputs c1 and c2 such that multiply(c1, c2) returns (-5+10j), we solve (a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)j = -5+10j for integers a, b, c, d. Choosing simple values: let c1 = 1+2j and c2 = 3+4j. Then:
- Real part: 1*3 - 2*4 = 3 - 8 = -5.
- Imaginary part: 1*4 + 2*3 = 4 + 6 = 10.
Thus, the product is (-5+10j). Since JSON doesn't natively support complex numbers, we represent them as strings that Python can parse into complex numbers, like "1+2j" and "3+4j".
