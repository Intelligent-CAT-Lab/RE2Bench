[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line from input and replaces all commas with spaces, then prints the result. The given output is "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc". This output has three words separated by single spaces. Therefore, the input must have had commas in place of those spaces, and no other commas, and no extra spaces. Specifically, the input likely was "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc". Any other input that yields the same output after replacement would need to have exactly two commas, and those commas must be the only characters that become spaces, and no other commas. Also, the input should not have any spaces that would affect the output (if there were spaces already, they would remain, potentially creating multiple spaces). Since the output has exactly one space between words, the input must have had commas without surrounding spaces. Therefore, the input is "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc".
