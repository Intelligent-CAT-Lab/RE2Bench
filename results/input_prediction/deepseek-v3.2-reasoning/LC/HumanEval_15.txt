[THOUGHT]
The function `string_sequence(n)` returns a string that joins numbers from 0 to n inclusive with spaces. The output is "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", which contains numbers from 0 to 10. Therefore, n must be 10 because `range(n+1)` would produce numbers 0 through 10. Thus, the input value for n is 10.
