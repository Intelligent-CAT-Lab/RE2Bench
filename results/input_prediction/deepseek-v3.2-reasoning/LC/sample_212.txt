[THOUGHT]
The function `f(nums)` performs `len(nums) - 1` reversals of the list in place. Reversing a list twice returns it to the original order. Therefore, after an even number of reversals, the list remains unchanged; after an odd number, it becomes reversed. The number of reversals is `len(nums) - 1`. Given the output list is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`, its length is 7, which is odd. Thus, `len(nums) - 1 = 6`, an even number. This means the input list must be identical to the output list. Therefore, the input `nums` is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
