[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `"<Version('1.11.3')>"`, which indicates that `parse()` returned a `Version` object with version string "1.11.3".
2. `parse()` takes a version string and attempts to create a `Version` object. If it fails, it creates a `LegacyVersion`. Here it successfully created a `Version` for "1.11.3".
3. Therefore, the input version string must be "1.11.3". This is a valid version string that matches the regex pattern expected by `Version` (no epoch, three release numbers, no pre/post/dev/local parts).
4. The structure requires filling `version` in `args`. The `self` is empty and `kwargs` is empty.
