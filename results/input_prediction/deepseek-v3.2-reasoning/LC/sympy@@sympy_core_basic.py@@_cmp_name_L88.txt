[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_cmp_name` compares two types `x` and `y` based on their names and a predefined list `ordering_of_classes`. It returns -1, 0, or 1.
2. The output is 1, meaning `x` is considered greater than `y`.
3. To achieve this, `y` must be a subclass of `Basic` (otherwise the function returns -1), and the names must differ.
4. We can ensure a return value of 1 by selecting class names that are not in `ordering_of_classes` and where `x.__name__` is lexicographically greater than `y.__name__`. This triggers the fallback lexicographic comparison, yielding 1.
5. Choose `x` with `__name__` "Z" and `y` with `__name__` "A", and ensure `y` is a subclass of `Basic`. Assume neither name appears in `ordering_of_classes`.
6. Then `i1` and `i2` will both be set to `UNKNOWN`, leading to lexicographic comparison: "Z" > "A" gives 1.
7. Represent these classes as strings in the JSON input, assuming the test environment defines them appropriately.
