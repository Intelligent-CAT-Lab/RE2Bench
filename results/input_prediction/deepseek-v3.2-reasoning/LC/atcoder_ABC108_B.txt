We are given the output "101 99 101 100". The code computes:
a = x2 - x1, b = y2 - y1, and prints x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a.
Set up equations:
1) x2 - b = 101
2) y2 + a = 99
3) x1 - b = 101
4) y1 + a = 100
Substituting a and b:
1) x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101 => x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
2) y2 + (x2 - x1) = 99 => x2 + y2 - x1 = 99
3) x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101 => x1 - y2 + y1 = 101
4) y1 + (x2 - x1) = 100 => x2 - x1 + y1 = 100
From equations 1 and 3, subtract: (x2 - y2 + y1) - (x1 - y2 + y1) = 101 - 101 => x2 - x1 = 0 => x2 = x1.
Plug into equation 4: x2 - x1 + y1 = 0 + y1 = 100 => y1 = 100.
From equation 3: x1 - y2 + 100 = 101 => x1 - y2 = 1 => y2 = x1 - 1.
From equation 2: x2 + y2 - x1 = y2 = 99 (since x2 = x1) => y2 = 99.
Then x1 - 1 = 99 => x1 = 100, so x2 = 100.
Check equation 1: 100 - 99 + 100 = 101, correct.
Thus input: x1=100, y1=100, x2=100, y2=99.
