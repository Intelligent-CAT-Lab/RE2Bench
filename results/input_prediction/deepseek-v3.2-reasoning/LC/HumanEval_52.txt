[THOUGHT]
The function `below_threshold` returns `False` if any element in list `l` is greater than or equal to integer `t`. The given output is `false`, meaning the function returned `False`. Therefore, we need to choose `l` and `t` such that at least one element in `l` is >= `t`. A simple example is `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = 5`, because 5 >= 5. Another valid example is `l = [10]` and `t = 5`. I'll choose the first one for simplicity.
