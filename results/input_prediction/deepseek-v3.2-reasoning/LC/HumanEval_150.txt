[THOUGHT]
The function `x_or_y` returns `y` if `n` is 1 or composite, and returns `x` if `n` is prime (greater than 1). Given the output is 3, there are two possibilities: either the function returned `x` (so `x=3` and `n` is prime) or it returned `y` (so `y=3` and `n` is 1 or composite). Without additional constraints, we can choose any valid combination. To keep it simple, we can take `n=1` (which triggers the immediate return of `y`). Then we set `y=3` and `x` can be any value, say `0`. Thus, the input could be `n=1, x=0, y=3`. This will produce output 3 because the function returns `y` which is 3.
