[THOUGHT]
The function f(s, tab) returns s.expandtabs(tab). The output is "Join us in Hungary". To get this output from expandtabs, the input string s must contain tab characters that expand to spaces. The simplest way is to have tabs between each word and set tab size to 1, so each tab expands to exactly one space. Thus s = "Join\tus\tin\tHungary" and tab = 1. Verify: "Join\tus\tin\tHungary".expandtabs(1) yields "Join us in Hungary". Other combinations are possible but less likely.
