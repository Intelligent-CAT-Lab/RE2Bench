The output of due() is 139.5. The due() method returns self.__total - discount, where discount is self.promotion(self) if promotion is not None, else 0. So we need to choose values such that __total - discount = 139.5.

One simple solution: set promotion to None, discount = 0, then __total must be 139.5. We can choose customer arbitrarily, e.g., {"name": "John", "fidelity": 0}. The cart should be such that its total is 139.5; for example, cart = [{"price": 139.5, "quantity": 1}]. We also set the private attribute __total to 139.5 for consistency.

Since the input structure expects JSON, promotion can be null. Thus, the input values can be filled accordingly.
