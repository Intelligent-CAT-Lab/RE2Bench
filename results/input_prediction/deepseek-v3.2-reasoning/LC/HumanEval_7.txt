[THOUGHT]
We have the function `filter_by_substring` that returns a list of strings from the input list that contain the given substring. The output is `["grunt", "prune"]`. Therefore, the input must include these two strings in the list, and the substring must be contained in both. The substring could be "un" because both "grunt" and "prune" contain the contiguous substring "un". To ensure the output matches exactly, we can include additional strings in the input list that do not contain "un", such as "apple" and "banana". Thus, a possible input is `strings = ["grunt", "apple", "prune", "banana"]` and `substring = "un"`. This yields the desired output after filtering.
