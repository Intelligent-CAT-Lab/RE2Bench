[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers A and B from input, computes ans = A - 2*B, and if ans is negative sets it to 0. The output is 0. Therefore, we must have A - 2*B <= 0. There are infinitely many integer pairs (A, B) that satisfy this condition. For instance, (A=0, B=0) yields ans = 0; (A=1, B=1) yields ans = -1, which is then set to 0; (A=2, B=1) yields ans = 0. Without additional constraints, any such pair is valid. I choose (A=2, B=1) as a representative example where ans is exactly 0 without needing correction. Thus the input string would be "2 1".
