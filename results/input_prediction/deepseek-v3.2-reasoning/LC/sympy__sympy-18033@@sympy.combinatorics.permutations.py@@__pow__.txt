[THOUGHT]
We are asked to find the input to Permutation.__pow__ given an output with _array_form null and _size 7. The output likely corresponds to the resulting Permutation after raising to power n. The result having _array_form null suggests it might be the identity permutation, which could be represented with _array_form = None to save memory. The size is 7, so the identity is of size 7. To get the identity as a result, we need self**n = identity. This can happen if n is a multiple of the order of self. The simplest non-trivial case is a transposition of order 2. So we can take self as a transposition swapping 0 and 1 in a permutation of size 7. That gives self._array_form = [1,0,2,3,4,5,6], _size = 7, _cyclic_form = [[0,1]]. Then with n=2, the result is the identity. The identity permutation might be stored with _array_form = None and _size = 7. This matches the output. Alternatively, n could be 0, but that is trivial. We choose n=2 as a typical test case.
