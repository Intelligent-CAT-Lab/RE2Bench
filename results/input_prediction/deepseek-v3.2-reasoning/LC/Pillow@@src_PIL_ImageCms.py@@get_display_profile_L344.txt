[THOUGHT]
The function `get_display_profile` returns `None` in the following cases:
1. The platform is not Windows (`sys.platform != 'win32'`).
2. The call to `core.get_display_profile_win32` returns `None`, indicating no display profile is found for the given handle.

Given the output is `null` (i.e., `None`), and we don't have control over the platform or system state via the input, the simplest and most predictable way to achieve this output is to assume the platform is not Windows. In that case, the function returns `None` immediately, regardless of the handle value. However, we must provide a specific handle input. The most natural input is the default value `None`, which corresponds to calling the function without arguments. This would also lead to `None` output on non-Windows platforms. On Windows, with `handle=None`, the function calls `core.get_display_profile_win32(0)`, which could potentially return a profile, but we are assuming the output is `None`, so we implicitly assume either a non-Windows platform or a Windows system with no default profile. Given the ambiguity, the simplest input consistent with the output is `handle=None`.

Therefore, we set `handle` to `null` in JSON.
