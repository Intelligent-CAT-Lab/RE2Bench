The function `calc_max_rows_first` computes `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2`. Given the output is 6, we solve for `max_rows`. Let `n = max_rows`. The equation `n // 2 + n % 2 = 6` has two integer solutions: `n = 11` (since `11 // 2 = 5` and `11 % 2 = 1`, sum 6) and `n = 12` (since `12 // 2 = 6` and `12 % 2 = 0`, sum 6). Both are mathematically valid. However, in typical data display contexts (like pandas or xarray), `max_rows` often defaults to an even number (e.g., 12) for symmetric splitting between head and tail. Without additional constraints, the most plausible input is `max_rows = 12`.
