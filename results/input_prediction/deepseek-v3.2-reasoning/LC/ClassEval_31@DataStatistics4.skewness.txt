The skewness function computes the sample skewness. The output is 0, which occurs when either:
1. The standard deviation is zero (all data points are identical), or
2. The sum of cubed deviations from the mean is zero, often due to symmetric data.
A simple symmetric dataset is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Let's verify:
- n = 5, mean = 3.
- Deviations: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], cubes: [-8, -1, 0, 1, 8], sum = 0.
- Standard deviation is non-zero, so skewness = 0 per the formula.
Thus, a valid input is data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
