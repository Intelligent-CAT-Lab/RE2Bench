1. The output is a list of unsampled indices from 0 to 149, totaling 56 indices. The largest index is 149, so n_samples must be at least 150. Since the unsampled list includes all indices not sampled, and 150 is not present, n_samples is likely exactly 150.
2. In bootstrap sampling, the number of bootstrap samples often equals the original sample size. Here, the number of distinct sampled indices is 94 (150 - 56). With n_samples_bootstrap = 150, the expected number of unsampled indices is approximately 150 * (1 - 1/150)^150 ≈ 55.2, close to 56. This suggests n_samples_bootstrap = 150 is plausible.
3. The random_state must be chosen such that the generated sample_indices exactly miss the 56 given indices. Common default random_state values like 0 are often used in examples. Given the deterministic nature, random_state = 0 is a reasonable guess to reproduce the pattern.
4. Thus, the inputs are random_state = 0, n_samples = 150, n_samples_bootstrap = 150.
