[THOUGHT]
The method `add_event` appends the given event to `self.events` and returns `None`. Therefore, for any input, the output is `null` (None). So we cannot uniquely determine the input from the output. However, we must provide some valid input that matches the given structure. We assume that before the call, `self.events` is an empty list (as typically initialized in `__init__`). We choose a sample event with a date, start_time, end_time, and description. The values can be arbitrary, so we pick plausible ones.
