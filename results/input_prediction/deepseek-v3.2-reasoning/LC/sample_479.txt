[THOUGHT]
The function f pops two elements from the list nums, first at index pop1-1, then at index pop2-1 (after the first pop). The output is [1,2,3], which has length 3, so the original list must have had length 5 because two pops remove two elements. The simplest and most natural input that produces [1,2,3] is nums = [1,2,3,4,5] with pop1=4 and pop2=4, which removes the fourth element (4) and then the new fourth element (5), leaving [1,2,3]. Alternatively, other inputs are possible, but given the context, this is the most straightforward.
