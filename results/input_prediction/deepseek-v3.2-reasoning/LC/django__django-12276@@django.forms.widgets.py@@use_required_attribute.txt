[THOUGHT]
We need to find the input `initial` value that makes `use_required_attribute` return `True`. The method returns `super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial)`. For the output to be `True`, both conditions must be `True`:
1. `super().use_required_attribute(initial)` must return `True`.
2. `not initial` must be `True`, meaning `initial` must be falsy.

Given the base class `Input` is not fully defined, we assume that `super().use_required_attribute(initial)` returns `True` by default (e.g., the widget is for a required field). The `self` has empty `attrs`, so no overriding attributes affect this.

Thus, `initial` must be a falsy value. Common falsy values in Django for `initial` are `None`, `False`, or empty string `""`. Since `initial` typically represents an initial file value, `None` is the most appropriate when no file is initially set.

Therefore, setting `initial` to `null` (JSON null) satisfies the condition.
