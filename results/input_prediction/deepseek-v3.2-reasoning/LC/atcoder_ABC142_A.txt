The code reads an integer N. If N is even, it prints 0.5. The output is 0.5050505050505051, which is not 0.5, so N must be odd. For odd N, the output is (N+1)/(N*2). Set this equal to 0.5050505050505051 and solve for N:
(N+1)/(2N) = 0.5050505050505051
=> N+1 = 1.0101010101010102 N
=> 1 = 0.0101010101010102 N
=> N = 1 / 0.0101010101010102 ≈ 99
Check N=99: (99+1)/(2*99) = 100/198 = 50/99 = 0.505050505050505050... which matches the given output. Therefore, the input is 99.
