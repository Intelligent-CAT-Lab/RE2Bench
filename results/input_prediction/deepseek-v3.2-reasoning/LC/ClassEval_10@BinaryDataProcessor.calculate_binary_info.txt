[THOUGHT]
The output of `calculate_binary_info` is a dictionary with:
- Zeroes: 0.475
- Ones: 0.525
- Bit length: 40

This indicates that `self.binary_string` (after cleaning) has:
- Total length = 40
- Number of '0's = 0.475 * 40 = 19
- Number of '1's = 0.525 * 40 = 21

The `__init__` method calls `clean_non_binary_chars()`, which presumably removes any characters that are not '0' or '1'. To achieve the exact counts and length, the cleaned string must consist only of 19 zeros and 21 ones. Therefore, the original `binary_string` passed to the constructor should be a string of length 40 containing exactly 19 zeros and 21 ones, with no non-binary characters (or with non-binary characters that, after removal, leave such a string). The simplest choice is a string with 19 zeros followed by 21 ones.
