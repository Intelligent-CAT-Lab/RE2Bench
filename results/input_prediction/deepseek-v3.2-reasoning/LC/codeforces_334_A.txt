[THOUGHT]
The output starts with "1 64", indicating j = n*n = 64, which implies n = 8 (since 8*8 = 64). The loop prints pairs (i, j) with i increasing from 1 and j decreasing from 64 until i < j. The last printed pair is "32 33", meaning when i = 32 and j = 33, i < j holds. After printing, i becomes 33 and j becomes 32, so i >= j and the loop terminates. The number of lines is 32, which is exactly half of 64, consistent with n = 8. Thus, the input is 8.
