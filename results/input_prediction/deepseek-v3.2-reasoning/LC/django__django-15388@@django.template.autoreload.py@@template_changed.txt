[THOUGHT]
1. The function `template_changed` returns `True` if:
   - `file_path.suffix` is not `.py`.
   - There exists a template directory (from `get_template_directories()`) that is a parent of `file_path`.
2. To satisfy this, choose a `file_path` that is inside a template directory and has a suffix other than `.py`.
3. Since `file_path` is used with `.suffix` and `.parents`, it must be a `Path` object. In JSON, represent it as a string, assuming the caller passes a `Path` object constructed from that string.
4. The `sender` argument is unused, so set it to a plausible value like the signal name, `"file_changed"`.
5. Assume a typical Django project structure: current working directory is `/home/user/project`, with a template directory `/home/user/project/templates`.
6. Set `file_path` to `/home/user/project/templates/index.html` (suffix `.html`, not `.py`, and inside the template directory).
7. This ensures the function returns `True`.
