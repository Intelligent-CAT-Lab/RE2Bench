[THOUGHT]
The `convert_to_ascii` method processes `self.binary_string` by taking 8-bit chunks, converting each to decimal, and decoding as ASCII. The output "hebo" corresponds to ASCII codes:
- 'h' = 104 → binary: 01101000
- 'e' = 101 → binary: 01100101
- 'b' = 98 → binary: 01100010
- 'o' = 111 → binary: 01101111

Concatenating these gives a 32-bit binary string: "01101000011001010110001001101111". The `clean_non_binary_chars` method removes any non-binary characters, so `self.binary_string` must consist solely of '0' and '1'. For exactly four ASCII characters, the binary string must be exactly 32 bits long, as each character requires 8 bits. Any extra bits would produce additional bytes, altering the output. Thus, `self.binary_string` is "01101000011001010110001001101111".
