[THOUGHT]
The method `withdraw_resume` removes a given resume from the `self.resumes` list. The output is `null` (Python's `None`), indicating the method executed successfully and returned nothing. For the removal to succeed without error, the resume must be present in `self.resumes`. The `job_listings` attribute is not used, so it can be any value. I'll choose simple example values: `job_listings` as an empty list, `resumes` as a list containing one resume dictionary, and the `resume` argument matching that dictionary. This ensures the method works and returns `None`.
