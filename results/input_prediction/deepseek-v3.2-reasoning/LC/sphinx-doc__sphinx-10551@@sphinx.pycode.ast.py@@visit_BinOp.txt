The output is "int | None", which is a string representation of a binary operation with the bitwise OR operator (|). The function `visit_BinOp` returns a string by joining the string representations of the left operand, operator, and right operand with spaces, except for the power operator (**) which concatenates without spaces. Since the output contains spaces, the operator is not `ast.Pow`, so the else branch is taken.

To produce "int | None":
- The left operand must be an `ast.Name` with `id="int"`, so `self.visit(node.left)` returns "int".
- The operator must be `ast.BitOr`, so `self.visit(node.op)` returns "|".
- The right operand must be an `ast.Constant` with `value=None`, so `self.visit(node.right)` returns "None".

The given structure specifies `node.left` as having an `id` field (indicating an `ast.Name`), `node.right` as having `value` and `kind` fields (indicating an `ast.Constant`), and `node.op` as an empty object (since no specific attributes are needed). Line numbers and column offsets are arbitrary but consistent with the expression's position. The `self` object has a `code` attribute that is not used here, so it can be set to null.

Thus, the input values are filled accordingly to produce the desired output.
