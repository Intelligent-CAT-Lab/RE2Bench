[THOUGHT]
The `heal` method adds 10 to the current HP, then caps it at 100 before returning. The output is 100, so after healing, HP is 100. This means the HP before healing must have been at least 90 (since 90 + 10 = 100 exactly, and any higher value up to 100 would also result in 100 after capping). To choose a specific value, I'll take the minimal HP that yields 100, which is 90. The other attributes (`name`, `attack_power`, `defense`, `level`, `exp`) do not affect the output, so I can set them to reasonable defaults. I'll use a generic name, zero for attack and defense, and the default level and exp from the class constructor.
