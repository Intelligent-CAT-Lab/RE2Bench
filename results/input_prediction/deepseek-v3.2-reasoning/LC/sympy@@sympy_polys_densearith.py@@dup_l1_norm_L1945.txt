[THOUGHT]
The function `dup_l1_norm` computes the sum of absolute values of coefficients of the polynomial f over domain K. Given output 3, we need f and K such that the sum of absolute coefficients is 3. The simplest is f = [3] (constant polynomial) and K being a domain where absolute value is the usual absolute value and sum works as usual, like the integer domain ZZ. Alternatively, f could be [1, -2] or [1, 1, 1], etc. But we choose the simplest. For K, since it must provide `abs` and `sum` methods, and the output is an integer, we assume K is the integer domain ZZ. In the input structure, we represent f as a list and K as a string identifier "ZZ", similar to how the example represented a callable as an empty dict.
