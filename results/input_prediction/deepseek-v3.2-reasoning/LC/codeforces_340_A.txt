[THOUGHT]
We need to find an input string containing four integers x, y, a, b such that when the code computes lcm = LCM(x, y) and then output = b // lcm - (a-1) // lcm, the result is 57900. There are infinitely many possible solutions. One simple solution is to take x = 1, y = 1 so that lcm = 1. Then the condition reduces to b - (a-1) = 57900. Choosing a = 1 gives b = 57900. Thus the input can be "1 1 1 57900". This satisfies the output.
