[THOUGHT]
The deposit method adds a non-negative amount to the balance and returns the new balance. The output is 300, so the sum of the initial balance and the deposited amount is 300. There are infinitely many possible pairs (self.balance, amount) with amount >= 0. However, common practice in testing such a method is to start with an initial balance of 0 (the default in __init__) and deposit the desired amount. Therefore, the most straightforward input is self.balance = 0 and amount = 300.
