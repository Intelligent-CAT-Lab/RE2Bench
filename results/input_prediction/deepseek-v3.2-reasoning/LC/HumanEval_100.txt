[THOUGHT]
The function `make_a_pile(n)` generates a list of length `n`, where the first element is `n` and each subsequent element increases by 2. The output list `[3, 5, 7]` has length 3, so `n` must be 3. Indeed, when `n = 3`, the list is `[3 + 2*0, 3 + 2*1, 3 + 2*2] = [3, 5, 7]`. Therefore, the input `n` is 3.
