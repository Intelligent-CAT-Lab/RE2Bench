[THOUGHT]
The Vigenère decryption algorithm works by shifting each letter backward by a shift value derived from the key. The shift for a character is computed as `ord(key_letter.lower()) - ord('a')`. The decryption preserves the case of the input ciphertext character. Given the output "AbCdEfG", which has an alternating case pattern (uppercase, lowercase, ...), the ciphertext must have the same alternating case pattern. To produce a non-trivial decryption (analogous to the Caesar example with shift 5), I choose a key of 'b' (shift 1). Then, for each letter in the plaintext "AbCdEfG", I compute the corresponding ciphertext letter by shifting forward by 1, preserving case. This yields ciphertext "BcDeFgH". Verification shows that decrypting "BcDeFgH" with key 'b' indeed gives "AbCdEfG". This is a valid input pair.
