[THOUGHT]
The `total` method computes the sum of `quantity * price` for each item in the cart. Given the output is 250.0, the cart must contain items whose total sum is 250.0. The `customer` and `promotion` attributes do not affect the calculation, so they can be arbitrary. For simplicity, choose a cart with one item: quantity 1 and price 250.0. Customer can be any name and fidelity value, and promotion can be `null`.
