[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `num`, appends a copy of its last element (`num[-1]`), and returns the modified list. The output list is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`. Since the last two elements are both `1`, the last element of the input list must be `1`. The output has 5 elements, so the input must have had 4 elements before the append operation. Therefore, the input list is the first 4 elements of the output: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`. No other input would produce this exact output because the function only appends the last element and does not alter the existing ones.
