The output "-1/8" is a rational number, indicating the integral value returned by `_polynomial_integrate`. To achieve this, we need inputs that yield this result. We consider a simple polygon and polynomial of degree 2. The integral of \(-3/2 \cdot x^2\) over the triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\) is \(-1/8\). This triangle has three facets (edges), and we define hp_params (half-plane parameters) corresponding to each edge with outward normals and appropriate distances. The polynomial is set to \(-3x^2/2\). This combination should produce the desired output.
