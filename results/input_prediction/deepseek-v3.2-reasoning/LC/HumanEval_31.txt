[THOUGHT]
The function is_prime(n) returns True if n is a prime number (n >= 2 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself). The output is True, so we need an n that is prime. The simplest prime number is 2. Let's verify: For n=2, the condition n < 2 is false, then the loop for k in range(2, n-1) becomes range(2, 1), which is empty because start > stop. Thus, the function returns True. Therefore, n=2 is a valid input that yields the output True.
