[THOUGHT]
The `write_csv` method returns 1 if the file is written successfully, and 0 if any exception occurs. The output 1 indicates success, so any valid `data` (an iterable of iterables) and `file_name` (a string that can be opened for writing) will work. Since there is no unique solution, we choose a simple valid example: an empty list for `data` and a generic filename "test.csv". This will succeed as long as the current directory is writable.
