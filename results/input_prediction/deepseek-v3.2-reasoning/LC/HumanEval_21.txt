The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers and returns a list where each number is linearly rescaled to the range [0, 1] based on the min and max of the input. The given output is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]. To find an input that produces this output, we note that the first output being 0.0 means the first input number is the minimum, and the last output being 1.0 means the last input number is the maximum. Let the input list be [a, b, c, d, e]. Then we have:

a = min  
e = max  
Let range = max - min = e - a. Then:

b = min + 0.25 * range  
c = min + 0.5 * range  
d = min + 0.75 * range  
e = min + range

Any choice of min and range > 0 yields a valid input. The simplest integer choice is min = 0 and range = 4, giving input [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. This is a common example for min-max scaling, where integers are rescaled to floats in [0, 1]. Verification: min = 0, max = 4, range = 4; (0-0)/4 = 0, (1-0)/4 = 0.25, (2-0)/4 = 0.5, (3-0)/4 = 0.75, (4-0)/4 = 1.0. So this input produces the exact output.
