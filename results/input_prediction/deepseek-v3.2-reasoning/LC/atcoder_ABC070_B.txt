[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d from input. It then computes `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))`. This expression gives the length of the intersection of the intervals [a, b] and [c, d]. The output is 0 when the intervals do not overlap, i.e., when `min(b, d) <= max(a, c)`. Therefore, to produce an output of 0, we need to choose a, b, c, d such that this inequality holds. One simple example is to take two disjoint intervals: [0,1] and [2,3]. Then a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3. Compute: min(b,d)=min(1,3)=1, max(a,c)=max(0,2)=2, so min(b,d)-max(a,c)=1-2=-1, and max(0,-1)=0. Thus, the input "0 1 2 3" yields the desired output.
