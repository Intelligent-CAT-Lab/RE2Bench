[THOUGHT]
The method `construct_stop_word_list` returns a fixed list `['a', 'an', 'the']` and does not depend on any arguments or instance attributes. Therefore, to produce the given output, the method must be called with an instance of `NLPDataProcessor` (which has no required attributes) and no additional arguments. Hence, `self`, `args`, and `kwargs` are all empty in the input structure.
