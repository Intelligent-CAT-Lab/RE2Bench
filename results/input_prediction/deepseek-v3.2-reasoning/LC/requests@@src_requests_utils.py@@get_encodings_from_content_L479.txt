[THOUGHT]
We need to find an input `content` such that `get_encodings_from_content` returns `["UTF-8"]`. The function uses three regex patterns to extract encodings from HTML/XML content. To get exactly one match in the output list, we must ensure that only one of the patterns matches exactly once, yielding "UTF-8". The simplest approach is to provide a string that contains a meta tag with charset="UTF-8", which will be matched by `charset_re` but not by `pragma_re` or `xml_re`. Alternatively, an XML declaration with encoding="UTF-8" would also work. We choose the meta tag for simplicity. The content should be minimal to avoid accidental matches. Therefore, we set `content` to `<meta charset="UTF-8">`. Simulating the regex matches confirms that only charset_re returns ["UTF-8"], resulting in the desired output.
