[THOUGHT]
The function f(array, elem) returns array.index(elem) if elem is in array, otherwise -1. Given the output is 0, we know that elem is in array and its index is 0. Therefore, elem must be the first element of array. There are many possible inputs that satisfy this condition. For example, array = [1] and elem = 1 would yield output 0. Another example is array = [0, 1, 2] and elem = 0. For simplicity, we choose array = [1] and elem = 1.
