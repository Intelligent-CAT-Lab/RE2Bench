[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 2x2 list of strings, each string representing a matrix.
2. The method `to_list` returns `self.rep.to_list()`. For an SDM rep, `to_list` returns a list of lists of the stored values.
3. To get a list of lists of strings, the rep must store those strings at the corresponding positions.
4. The rep structure in the input is a dict with rows "0" and "1", each with columns "0" and "1". So we set the values to the given strings.
5. The shape of the DomainMatrix is (2,2) because the rep has 2 rows and 2 columns.
6. The domain is not directly used in `to_list` since all entries are present, but we need to specify something. Since the matrices have integer entries, the base ring could be ZZ. We set domain to "ZZ" as a plausible guess.
