1. The output is `{"output": 3}`, which corresponds to the return value of `get_n_splits`. This method returns `self.n_splits`, so `self.n_splits` must be 3.
2. The `_BaseKFold` object is initialized with `n_splits`, `shuffle`, and `random_state`. To be valid, `shuffle` must be a boolean, and if `shuffle` is False, `random_state` must be None. Since the output does not depend on these, we can choose simple values: `shuffle=False` and `random_state=None`.
3. The arguments `X`, `y`, and `groups` of `get_n_splits` are not used in the method, so they can be any value. We can set them to `null` (None) for simplicity.
4. The `kwargs` is empty as per the structure.

Thus, the input values are determined as above.
