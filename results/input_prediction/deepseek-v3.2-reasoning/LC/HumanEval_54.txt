[THOUGHT]
The function `same_chars` returns `True` if the sets of characters of the two input strings are equal. The given output is `true`, so we need to choose `s0` and `s1` such that `set(s0) == set(s1)`. This means the strings must contain the same distinct characters, regardless of order or frequency. A simple example is `s0 = "abc"` and `s1 = "cba"`, as both sets are `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`. Another valid pair is `s0 = "hello"` and `s1 = "helo"`, but for simplicity, we choose the first example. Simulating: `set("abc") == set("cba")` evaluates to `True`.
