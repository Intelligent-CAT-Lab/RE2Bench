The function takes an array and maps each number to a string of 'n' repeated that many times.  
It then appends each string to `final_output` and returns that list.  

Given the output is an empty list `[]`, that means `just_ns` must be empty, so the input `array` must be empty as well (since `map` over an empty list yields empty).  

Thus, `array = []`.  

[THOUGHT]  
`f([])` → `just_ns = []` → loop does nothing → returns `[]`.  
Matches given output.
