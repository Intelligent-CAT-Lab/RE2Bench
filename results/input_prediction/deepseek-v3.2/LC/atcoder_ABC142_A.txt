Let me analyze this code step by step:

1. The code reads an integer `N` from input
2. If `N` is even, it prints `0.5`
3. If `N` is odd, it prints `(N + 1) / N / 2`

The output given is `0.5050505050505051`, which is approximately `0.50505...`

First, let's see if this could be from the even case:
- If `N` is even, output would be exactly `0.5`
- But we have `0.5050505050505051`, which is slightly more than `0.5`, so it must be from the odd case

Let's solve for N in the odd case:
```
(N + 1) / N / 2 = 0.5050505050505051
(N + 1)/(2N) = 0.5050505050505051
N + 1 = 1.0101010101010102 × N
1 = 0.0101010101010102 × N
N = 1 / 0.0101010101010102
```

Let me calculate this:
```
0.0101010101010102 ≈ 1/99
So N ≈ 1 / (1/99) = 99
```

Let me verify with N = 99:
```
(99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = 100 / 198 ≈ 0.5050505050505051
```

Yes, this matches the given output exactly. Therefore, the input should be `99`.
