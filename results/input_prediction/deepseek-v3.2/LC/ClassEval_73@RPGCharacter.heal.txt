The heal method adds 10 to the current HP, then caps it at 100.  
The output after healing is 100.  

That means either:  
1. HP before healing was ≥ 90 → adding 10 gives ≥ 100 → caps to 100, or  
2. HP before healing was already 100 (or more), but the cap will still give 100.

Since the method returns self.hp after healing, the input hp could be 90, 91, …, 100 or even higher (since if hp > 100 initially, heal sets it to 100). But from the code, initial hp at instantiation could be >100, but heal still caps at 100.  

However, we have to pick one set of inputs that fits the output.  
Since other attributes (name, attack_power, defense, level, exp) don’t affect heal’s output, we can choose plausible defaults.

For simplicity, choose hp=95 → 95+10=105 → cap at 100 → output=100.

Arbitrarily pick:  
name="Hero", hp=95, attack_power=10, defense=5, level=1, exp=0.
