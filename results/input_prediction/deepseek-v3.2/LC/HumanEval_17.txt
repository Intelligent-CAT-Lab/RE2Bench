[THOUGHT]
Looking at the function `parse_music`, it takes a music_string and splits it by spaces. Then it maps each token to a number using the note_map dictionary:
- 'o' maps to 4
- 'o|' maps to 2
- '.|' maps to 1

The output is [1, 1, 1, 1], which means there must have been 4 tokens in the music_string, and each token must have mapped to 1.

Looking at the mapping, the only token that maps to 1 is '.|'. Therefore, the music_string must have contained four occurrences of '.|' separated by spaces.

So the music_string should be: ".| .| .| .|"
