Let's simulate the function step by step.  

Given the function:  

1. `a, b = x.split('/')` — so `x` is a fraction string like `"num/den"`.  
2. `c, d = n.split('/')` — so `n` is also a fraction string like `"num/den"`.  
3. `numerator = int(a) * int(c)` — product of numerators.  
4. `denom = int(b) * int(d)` — product of denominators.  
5. Check if `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` — i.e., if the result is a whole number.  
6. If yes → return `True`, else `False`.  

We are told the output is `True`. That means:  

\[
\frac{\text{int}(a) \times \text{int}(c)}{\text{int}(b) \times \text{int}(d)} \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

We need to choose example fractions for `x` and `n` that make this true.  

Simple case: both `x` and `n` are integers as fractions (e.g., `"2/1"` and `"3/1"`):  
\[
\frac{2 \times 3}{1 \times 1} = 6 \quad \text{(integer)} \quad \Rightarrow \text{True}.
\]  

Let’s check quickly:  
`x = "2/1"`, `n = "3/1"`  
- `a = "2"`, `b = "1"`  
- `c = "3"`, `d = "1"`  
- `numerator = 2 * 3 = 6`  
- `denom = 1 * 1 = 1`  
- `6 / 1 = 6`, `int(6) = 6`, equality holds → `True`.  

This fits.  

Any other valid pair would work too, but the simplest is fine.  

[THOUGHT]  
We want `x` and `n` as strings `"num/den"` with integer numerator and denominator such that `(a*c)/(b*d)` is an integer. Simplest is `"2/1"` and `"3/1"`. Let’s use those.
