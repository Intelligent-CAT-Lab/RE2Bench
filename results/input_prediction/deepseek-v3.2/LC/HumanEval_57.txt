The function returns `True` if the list `l` is either sorted in non-decreasing order or sorted in non-increasing order.  
Given the output is `True`, the input list `l` must be monotonic (either entirely non-decreasing or entirely non-increasing).  

I can choose any valid monotonic list for `l`.  
A simple example is `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
