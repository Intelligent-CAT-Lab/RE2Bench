Let's simulate the function execution step by step.

The function `remove_vowels` removes all lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from the input `text` and returns the resulting string.

Given output: `"bcdf\nghjklm"`

That means after removing vowels from the input, we are left with:
- `"bcdf"`
- newline `\n`
- `"ghjklm"`

So the input string must have contained characters such that when vowels are removed, those characters remain.

Possible vowels in the input that were removed:
- In the first part `"bcdf"`, original could be something like `"abcde f"`?  
But careful: the output shows no spaces, so spaces weren’t in the input because they'd stay in the output unless also removed — but function only removes vowels.

Let's reconstruct the input logically:

1. Output has `"bcdf"` → could have been `"abcdef"` (remove 'a' and 'e'), leaving `"bcdf"`.
2. Output has `\n` → that’s a newline character, not a vowel, so it remains.
3. Output has `"ghjklm"` → could have been `"ghijklm"` (remove 'i'), leaving `"ghjklm"`.

Thus the input could be `"abcdef\nghijklm"`.

Let’s verify by simulating the function:

Input `"abcdef\nghijklm"`:
- Process each char:  
a → vowel → removed  
b → keep  
c → keep  
d → keep  
e → vowel → removed  
f → keep  
\n → keep  
g → keep  
h → keep  
i → vowel → removed  
j → keep  
k → keep  
l → keep  
m → keep  

Result: `"bcdf\nghjklm"` ✅

Thus the input is `"abcdef\nghijklm"`.

[THOUGHT]
Given output `"bcdf\nghjklm"`, we need an input string that, when vowels removed, yields exactly that.
Trying "abcdef\nghijklm": removes 'a', 'e', 'i' → `"bcdf\nghjklm"` matches output.
