The function checks that all three arguments are integers, and then checks if any two sum to the third.  
Given the output is `true`, that means:  

1. `x`, `y`, `z` are all integers.  
2. One of these is true:  
   - \( x + y = z \)  
   - \( x + z = y \)  
   - \( y + z = x \)  

We need to pick one possible integer triple satisfying these.  
One simple example: let \( x = 2, y = 3, z = 5 \) → \( x + y = z \) holds.  
All are integers, so the function will return `True`.  

Thus one possible input is `x = 2, y = 3, z = 5`.

[THOUGHT]  
The condition `any_int(2, 3, 5)` gives `True` because all are integers and `2 + 3 == 5`.  
So `x = 2, y = 3, z = 5` matches the output `true`.
