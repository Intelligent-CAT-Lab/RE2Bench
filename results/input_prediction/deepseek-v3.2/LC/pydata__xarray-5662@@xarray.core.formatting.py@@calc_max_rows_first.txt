The function `calc_max_rows_first` takes `max_rows` as input and returns `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2`.  
Given output is `6`.  

We solve for `max_rows` in:  
`max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2 = 6`.  

Let’s test integer possibilities:  
If `max_rows` is even: `max_rows % 2 = 0`, so `max_rows // 2 = 6` → `max_rows = 12`.  
If `max_rows` is odd: `max_rows % 2 = 1`, so `max_rows // 2 + 1 = 6` → `max_rows // 2 = 5` → `max_rows = 11`.  

Check both:  
- `max_rows = 12`: `12 // 2 + 12 % 2 = 6 + 0 = 6` ✅  
- `max_rows = 11`: `11 // 2 + 11 % 2 = 5 + 1 = 6` ✅  

Both satisfy. Which one is intended? The output doesn’t specify further, so multiple inputs are possible.  
But the `calc_max_rows_first` suggests “first half” for display, so likely splitting a total number of rows into two parts (first half larger or equal). In many display contexts, `max_rows` is an odd or even total. Since the function name says “first” and integer division rounds down, both could occur. But without more context, I’ll choose one that makes sense: perhaps the test uses `max_rows = 12` for simplicity.  

However, looking at the provided code and typical usage, `max_rows` might come from `OPTIONS` for display; but here we just need one possible input. I’ll pick `max_rows = 12`.  

In the input structure, `self` is empty, `args` has `max_rows`, `kwargs` empty.
