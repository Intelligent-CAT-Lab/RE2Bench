The function `greatest_common_divisor` implements the Euclidean algorithm:  
`while b: a, b = (b, a % b)` then returns `a`.

Given the output is `5`, we know that at the end of the loop, `a = 5` and `b = 0`.  
We need to find integers `a` and `b` such that applying the algorithm yields `5`.

We can choose simple values: for example, `a = 5`, `b = 0` would give `output = 5`, but the loop would never run because `b = 0` initially. That's valid, but maybe we want `b ≠ 0` initially to show the algorithm works.

Alternatively, any pair `(5*k, 5)` where `k` is an integer would give GCD 5. Let’s pick `a = 15`, `b = 5`:

- Iteration 1: `a=15, b=5` → `a, b = (5, 15 % 5 = 0)` → `a=5, b=0`  
- Loop stops, return `a=5`.

So `(a=15, b=5)` works.  

We could also pick `a=5, b=15`:

- Iteration 1: `a=5, b=15` → `a, b = (15, 5 % 15 = 5)` → `a=15, b=5`  
- Iteration 2: `a=15, b=5` → `a, b = (5, 15 % 5 = 0)` → `a=5, b=0`  
- Loop stops, return `a=5`.

Both work, but `(5,15)` requires more steps. The problem only needs one valid input pair.

I’ll choose `a=15, b=5`.
