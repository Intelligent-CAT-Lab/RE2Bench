Let’s reason through this step-by-step.

The `get_encodings_from_content` function returns a list of charset/encoding strings found in HTML/XML content.  
It searches using three regex patterns:  

1. `charset_re` looks for `<meta ... charset="...">`  
2. `pragma_re` looks for `<meta ... content="...charset=...">`  
3. `xml_re` looks for `<?xml ... encoding="...">`  

The output is `["UTF-8"]`. This means exactly one match was found in the content, and it matched one of the regexes for `"UTF-8"`.

Possible minimal content that would yield only `["UTF-8"]`:  
- `'<meta charset="UTF-8">'` → matches `charset_re`.  
- `'<?xml encoding="UTF-8"?>'` → matches `xml_re`.  
- Could also be `<meta content="charset=UTF-8">`, but the regex requires `<meta.*?content=["\\']*;?charset=(.+?)["\\'>]` so `charset=UTF-8` inside `content` works.

But careful: the three regexes are concatenated with `+`, so if multiple matches occur, multiple entries will be in the output list.  
We want exactly `["UTF-8"]` → only one match total across all three regexes.

Also note that the regexes use `findall` → they return all non-overlapping matches in the string for each pattern, in order of discovery (patterns in order charset_re, pragma_re, xml_re).

If we use `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, `charset_re` will match `["UTF-8"]`, and pragma_re and xml_re will have no matches.  
That gives exactly `["UTF-8"]`.

Let’s test:  
charset_re: `<meta.*?charset=["\\\']*(.+?)["\\\'>]`  
matches `charset="UTF-8"` → group1 = `UTF-8`. Yes.  

So the simplest input `content` is `<meta charset="UTF-8">`.

But — is that the only possibility?  
Yes, but could also be in an HTML comment or with extra spaces; but minimal is fine.  
We just need to satisfy the given structure, which only asks for `content` value.

Thus `args.content` = `'<meta charset="UTF-8">'`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The function searches for charset declarations in HTML/XML using three regexes.
2. Output is `["UTF-8"]` → only one match, from one of the regex patterns.
3. Simplest: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` triggers `charset_re`, returns `["UTF-8"]`.
4. Check no other matches: pragma_re needs `content="...charset=..."` — not present. xml_re needs `<?xml encoding="...">` — not present.
5. Therefore content is `'<meta charset="UTF-8">'`.
