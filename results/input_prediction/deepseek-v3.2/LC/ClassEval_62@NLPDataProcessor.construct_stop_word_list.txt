[THOUGHT]
The method `construct_stop_word_list` takes no arguments (self is automatically passed but doesn't require any external input). It simply returns a fixed list of stop words: ['a', 'an', 'the']. The output shows exactly this list. Therefore, the input should be empty for both args and kwargs, and self can be an empty object since no instance variables are used.
