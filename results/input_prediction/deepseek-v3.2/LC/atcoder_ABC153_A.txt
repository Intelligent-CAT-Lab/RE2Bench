Let's reason through this step by step.

We have the Python code:

```python
import math
h, a = map(int, input().split())
print(math.ceil(h / a))
```

Given output: `6`

We know that `math.ceil(h / a)` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `h / a`. So the output is 6.

Thus we have:
`math.ceil(h / a) = 6`

This implies:
`5 < h / a <= 6` because `ceil` gives the smallest integer >= the division.

More precisely:
`ceil(x) = 6` means `5 < x <= 6`? Actually, if `x = 5.0`, `ceil(5.0) = 5`. So `ceil(x) = 6` means `5 < x <= 6`. But if `x` is exactly 6, `ceil(6) = 6`. So `h / a` is in the interval `(5, 6]`.

In other words: `h / a > 5` and `h / a <= 6`.

Since `h` and `a` are integers, we can set `h / a = some value in that range`.

We need to find integer `h` and `a` such that `ceil(h / a) = 6`.

The simplest case is if `h / a = 6` exactly, then `h = 6 * a`. But then `ceil(6) = 6`. So choose any positive integer `a`, then `h = 6 * a`. For simplicity, let `a = 1`, then `h = 6`. Input would be `"6 1"`.

But there are many possibilities. For instance, `h = 11`, `a = 2` gives `h/a = 5.5`, `ceil(5.5) = 6`. Another: `h = 17`, `a = 3` gives `17/3 ≈ 5.666`, `ceil = 6`. Any pair where `h / a` is greater than 5 and at most 6.

We only need one possible input. Since the problem likely expects a single input, we can pick the simplest: `6 1`.

Check: `6 / 1 = 6`, `ceil(6) = 6`. Output is `6`. Yes.

But also note: `h` and `a` are read from input line, split by spaces. So the input is a string with two integers separated by space.

Thus we can set `input()` to `"6 1"`.

However, there is no unique solution. The output only gives the result of `ceil(h/a) = 6`. So any `(h, a)` that satisfy the condition would be acceptable.

But we should probably choose the minimal one.

Let's consider if the problem expects a specific pair. Since the output is just `6`, we can choose the simplest.

In the given structure, it expects:

```
{
    "input": XXX
}
```

Where `XXX` should be replaced with the actual input string.

So we can put: `"6 1"`.

But also note: the output is printed as `6` without quotes, but the output JSON says `"output": 6` (number). That's fine.

We'll go with `"6 1"`.

[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers `h` and `a`. It prints `math.ceil(h / a)`. Given output is 6, we need `h` and `a` such that `ceil(h / a) = 6`. One simple solution: `h = 6`, `a = 1`. Then input string is `"6 1"`.
