From the output list `[2, 0, 0, 1]`, the function computes `abs(x - y)` for each pair in `zip(game, guess)`.  

This means:  
- First pair difference: `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`  
- Second: `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0` → `game[1] == guess[1]`  
- Third: `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0` → `game[2] == guess[2]`  
- Fourth: `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`  

`game` and `guess` are lists (or sequences) of numbers, each of length 4.  

Possible integer combinations:  
- If `game[0] - guess[0] = 2` or `-2`. Choose `game[0] = 5`, `guess[0] = 3` (difference 2).  
- For `game[1] = guess[1]`, pick `10` for both.  
- For `game[2] = guess[2]`, pick `7` for both.  
- For `game[3] - guess[3] = 1` or `-1`. Pick `game[3] = 9`, `guess[3] = 8` (difference 1).  

Thus:  
`game = [5, 10, 7, 9]`  
`guess = [3, 10, 7, 8]`  

Check:  
`[abs(5-3), abs(10-10), abs(7-7), abs(9-8)] = [2, 0, 0, 1]`.
