[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes an array as input and creates a copy of it: `new_array = array.copy()`
2. Then it reverses this copy: `new_array = reversed(new_array)`
3. Finally, it returns a list comprehension that squares each element in the reversed array: `[x * x for x in new_array]`

The output is `[1, 4, 1]`, which means that after reversing the array and squaring each element, we get this result.

Since the function reverses the array before squaring, I need to work backwards from the output:
- The squared values are [1, 4, 1]
- To get the original values before squaring, I take the square root of each: [1, 2, 1]
- But since the array was reversed before squaring, I need to reverse this back to get the original input array: [1, 2, 1]

Let me verify this:
- Input array: [1, 2, 1]
- Copy and reverse: [1, 2, 1] → reversed becomes [1, 2, 1]
- Square each element: [1×1, 2×2, 1×1] = [1, 4, 1]
- This matches the given output.

Therefore, the input array should be [1, 2, 1].
