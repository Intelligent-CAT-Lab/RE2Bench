Let’s work through it step-by-step.

**Step 1 — Understand the function logic**  
The function `rounded_avg(n, m)`:
1. Returns `-1` if `m < n`.
2. Otherwise, sums all integers from `n` to `m` inclusive:  
   `summation = sum(range(n, m+1))`.
3. Computes the **average** = `summation / (m - n + 1)`.
4. Rounds that average to the nearest integer (`round(average)`).
5. Converts the rounded integer to binary with `bin()`, which returns a string like `"0b..."`.

The output given is `"0b101101110"`.

**Step 2 — Convert binary output back to decimal**  
`0b101101110` in binary:
- `1*256 + 0*128 + 1*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 1*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1`  
= `256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2` = `366`.

So `round(summation / (m - n + 1)) = 366`.

**Step 3 — Formula for average**  
Let `k = m - n + 1` (the number of terms).  
`summation = (n + m) * k / 2`.  
Average = `(n + m) / 2`.  
Rounding average: `round((n + m) / 2) = 366`.  
So `(n + m) / 2` is close to 366 — more precisely between 365.5 and 366.499... for rounding to 366.

**Step 4 — Range for n + m**  
From rounding rule:  
`366 - 0.5 <= (n + m)/2 < 366 + 0.5`  
`366 - 0.5 <= (n + m)/2 < 366.5`  
Multiply by 2:  
`731 <= n + m < 733`  
So `n + m` is either 731 or 732.

**Step 5 — Try integer possibilities**  
Let `avg_unrounded = (n + m) / 2`.  
Rounding to 366 means:  
- If `n + m = 731` → avg = 365.5 → round = 366 (ties round to even, here 366 is even). Yes.  
- If `n + m = 732` → avg = 366 → round = 366. Yes.

Both are possible. But we need `n` and `m` integers with `n <= m`.  
Also `k = m - n + 1` = number of terms, and `summation = avg_unrounded * k` must be integer.

Case 1: `n + m = 731`, `avg_unrounded = 365.5`.  
Sum = `365.5 * k`. For Sum integer, `k` must be even. Let’s solve:  
`m - n + 1 = k`  
`m + n = 731`  
Add equations: `2m + 1 = 731 + k` → `m = (731 + k - 1)/2 = (730 + k)/2`.  
For m integer, `730 + k` must be even → `k` even works.  
Also `n = (731 - k + 1)/2 = (732 - k)/2`. For n integer, `732 - k` even → `k` even works.  
So `k` even works.

Case 2: `n + m = 732`, `avg_unrounded = 366`.  
Sum = `366 * k`. Sum always integer here.  
`m - n + 1 = k`  
`m + n = 732`  
Adding: `2m + 1 = 732 + k` → `m = (732 + k - 1)/2 = (731 + k)/2`.  
For m integer, `731 + k` must be even → `k` must be odd.  
`n = (732 - k + 1)/2 = (733 - k)/2`. For n integer, `733 - k` must be even → `k` odd works.  
So `k` must be odd.

**Step 6 — Narrow down k**  
We don’t know k, but we have `summation = (n + m) * k / 2`.  
In case 1: Sum = `365.5 * k`.  
In case 2: Sum = `366 * k`.  

Original formula in code:  
`round(summation / k)` →  
Case 1: `summation / k = 365.5`, round → 366.  
Case 2: `summation / k = 366`, round → 366.  
Both produce 366. So both possible mathematically.

But we must choose one pair `(n, m)` consistent with code steps.  
We can test small k examples:  
If `k = 1`, then `n = m`.  
Case 1: `n + m = 731`, `n = m` → `2n = 731` → n not integer → impossible.  
Case 2: `n + m = 732`, `n = m` → `2n = 732` → n = 366, m = 366. Then avg = 366, round = 366, bin = `0b101101110`. Works!  

So one valid solution: `n = 366, m = 366`.  
Check: n=366, m=366 → m>=n.  
Summation = 366.  
k = 1 → average = 366 → round = 366 → bin = `0b101101110`. ✅  

**Step 7 — Are there others?**  
Yes, many others possible. But given this is a puzzle with one expected answer, likely simplest: `n = m`.  
But let’s see if output matches uniquely? Wait — if n=365, m=367 → n+m=732, k=3.  
Sum = 365+366+367=1098 → avg=366 → round=366 → works too. So multiple answers possible.

Given typical programming challenge, they often pick `n = m` if possible. But we need a specific answer.

Check: 366 in binary: `101101110` indeed matches.

**Step 8 — Select example that matches output format**  
The function returns `bin(...)` which gives `"0b101101110"` for integer 366.  
So the rounded average = 366 → `n+m = 732 or 731`. Smallest simplest: `n=m=366`.

Let’s finalize:  

[THOUGHT]
The output `"0b101101110"` is binary for decimal 366. This means `round(summation/(m-n+1)) = 366`.  
Summation from n to m inclusive equals `(n+m)*(m-n+1)/2`. Rounding average to 366 means `n+m ≈ 732`.  
Simplest integer solution with n ≤ m is n=366, m=366:  
Sum=366, count=1, average=366 → rounded=366 → binary=0b101101110. ✅  
Other solutions exist, but this matches the output exactly and is minimal.
