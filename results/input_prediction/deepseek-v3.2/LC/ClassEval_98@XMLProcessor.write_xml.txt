[THOUGHT]
The code shows that `write_xml` method attempts to write XML to a file using `ET.ElementTree.write()`. The output is `false`, which means the method returned `False`. Looking at the code, `write_xml` returns `False` only when an exception occurs during the write operation (in the `except` block).

For `ET.ElementTree.write()` to fail and raise an exception, possible reasons include:
1. `self.root` is `None` (cannot write an empty tree)
2. The file path is invalid or write permissions are denied
3. Other I/O errors

The most straightforward reason based on the structure would be that `self.root` is `None`, since that's explicitly initialized in the constructor and would cause the write operation to fail immediately.

Therefore, `self.root` should be `None`. The `file_name` parameters can be arbitrary since the failure happens due to `self.root` being `None` before file writing is attempted.
