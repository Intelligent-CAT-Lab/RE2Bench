Let’s work through this step-by-step.  

The output is:  

```
1 64
2 63
...
32 33
```

Each line prints `i` and `j`, where `i` starts at `1` and `j` starts at `n*n`, and each iteration `i += 1`, `j -= 1`.  
They stop when `i < j` is no longer true.  

---

**Step 1 — Understand the number of lines printed**  
We have exactly 32 lines in the output (counting them: first line `1 64`, last line `32 33`).  

---

**Step 2 — Relating number of lines to `n`**  
Initially:  
`i = 1`  
`j = n*n`  
`print` occurs while `i < j`.  
Each loop iteration increments `i` and decrements `j`, so `i` and `j` move toward each other 2 steps closer each iteration.  

The loop runs while `i < j`. When they meet or cross, it stops.  

Given the last printed line is `i = 32, j = 33`, the next step would be `i = 33, j = 32`, but then `i < j` is `False`, so it stops.  
So number of iterations = 32.  

---

**Step 3 — Find initial `j`**  
From start `i = 1`, after `32` iterations:  
Final `i` = `1 + 32 = 33` (but last printed `i` was 32).  
Wait — careful:  
Actually, in the last iteration printed, `i = 32`, `j = 33`.  
Then `i += 1 → 33`, `j -= 1 → 32`, loop condition `33 < 32`? False, so stops without printing `33 32`.  
Correct.  

So after `32` iterations, `i` increased by 32 to `33`, `j` decreased by 32 from initial `j = n*n` to `n*n - 32`.  

But after `32` iterations, `j = 33` (given in last print).  
Thus:  

\[
n^2 - 32 = 33
\]
\[
n^2 = 65
\]
This doesn’t give integer `n`… so maybe I miscounted lines.  

---

**Step 4 — Recheck last printed pair**  
Last printed: `32 33`.  
That means when `i=32`, `j=33` printed, then `i += 1 → 33`, `j -= 1 → 32`.  
Now `33 < 32` is false, stops.  

So initial `j = 64` (since first printed pair `1 64`).  
So initial `j = n*n = 64`.  

Thus \( n^2 = 64 \) → \( n = 8 \).  

---

**Step 5 — Verify number of iterations**  
If initial `j = 64`, `i = 1`, each iteration they move toward each other by 2 total.  
They’ll meet when `i >= j`. Let’s check:  

Iteration count = floor((j_initial - i_initial) / 2) = ?  
Better: total printed lines:  

Loop runs while `i < j`. After each iteration, `i` and `j` get closer by 2.  
Initial difference: `64 - 1 = 63`.  
They’ll meet/cross when difference ≤ 1? Actually when `i >= j` → difference ≤ 0.  
But since difference decreases by 2 each step, initial difference 63, after k steps difference = 63 - 2k.  

Stop when `i >= j` → difference <= 0 → 63 - 2k <= 0 → 2k >= 63 → k >= 31.5 → k = 32.  

So 32 iterations exactly, matching output lines count. Yes.  

---

**Step 6 — Conclusion**  
So `n = 8` is the input.  

---

[THOUGHT]  
The output shows pairs from (1, 64) to (32, 33).  
This means `n*n = 64`, so `n = 8`.  
The loop prints while `i < j`, starting at `i = 1`, `j = 64`.  
After 32 iterations, `i = 33`, `j = 32`, loop stops.  
So the input `n` is 8.
