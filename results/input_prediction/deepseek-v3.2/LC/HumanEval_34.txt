From the function, `unique(l)` returns `sorted(list(set(l)))`.  
That means:  
1. Convert list `l` to a set (removes duplicates, loses order).  
2. Convert back to a list.  
3. Sort the list.  

The output is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.  
This is already sorted, so the set of `l` must have been `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}` (order irrelevant in a set).  
The input list `l` must have contained only these numbers, possibly with duplicates and in any order.  

The simplest possible `l` is exactly `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, but it could also be something like `[123, 5, 2, 0, 9, 3]`, or with repetitions, e.g., `[0, 2, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123, 0]`.  
Since the problem says "predict the input" and doesn't restrict to minimal form, any list with exactly those elements as unique values is valid.  
I'll choose the simplest: `l = [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
