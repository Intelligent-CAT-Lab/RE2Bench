Let's simulate the code:  

The program reads `S` and `W` from `input()` as space-separated integers.  
If `S <= W`, it prints `"unsafe"`; otherwise `"safe"`.  

The output is `"unsafe"`, so the condition `S <= W` must be true.  
`S` and `W` can be any integers satisfying `S <= W`.  

The simplest example would be `S = 5, W = 10`, but the original input might have been different. However, from the code we can only deduce that `S <= W`.  
Since no specific input example was given besides the output, I can choose any valid pair.  

Let’s pick `S = 1` and `W = 100` → input `"1 100"`.  

[THOUGHT]  
Given output "unsafe", condition `S <= W` must be true. We can set `S = 1` and `W = 100` as one possible input.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "1 100"
}
```
