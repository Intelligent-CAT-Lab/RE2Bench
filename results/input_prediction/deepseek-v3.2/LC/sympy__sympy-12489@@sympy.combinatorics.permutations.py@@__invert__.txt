Let's go step by step.

---

**Step 1: Understanding the given code**  

We are given a class `Permutation` (though the second definition might be a conflict; but in the context, the one shown includes `__invert__` defined as:  

```python
def __invert__(self):
    return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))
```

Here, `_af_invert` is not shown, but we can assume it computes the inverse permutation from the array form.  
`self._array_form` is an integer list representation of the permutation.  
The output of `__invert__` is a new `Permutation` object.

---

**Step 2: Understanding the problem**  

We are told: Given the **output** of `__invert__`:

```json
{
    "_array_form": null,
    "_size": 5
}
```

That means the **returned** permutation object after inversion has `_array_form = None` and `_size = 5`.  

The input is the `self` for which `self.__invert__()` produces this output.

---

**Step 3: What does `_af_invert` do?**  

Inverse of a permutation: if `p` is a permutation in array form, its inverse `q` satisfies `q[p[i]] = i`.  
If `_array_form` of result is `None`, then likely `self._array_form` is also `None`? Let's check:  

If `self._array_form` is `None`, then `_af_invert(self._array_form)` could be `None`, so the new permutation has `_array_form = None`, `_size` unchanged.

But `_size` in output is 5, so `self._size` must also be 5.  

But `__invert__` in `Permutation` class might set `_size` based on `self._size`. Let's confirm by looking at `_af_new` logic (not fully given).  

Typically `Permutation._af_new(arr)` creates a new permutation with `arr` as array form, and `_size = len(arr)` if arr is not None. But if arr is `None`, `_size` could be taken from something else? Actually, in code above, `_size` is set in `__init__` or property depending on `_array_form`. If `_array_form` is `None`, `_size` defaults to something—but here in output, `_size` is 5, so likely the inverse permutation has `_size = 5`.

So if `self._size = 5` and `self._array_form = None`, then inverse is also a permutation with `_size = 5` and `_array_form = None`.

---

**Step 4: Check with example**  

`Permutation()` with `_array_form = None` and `_size = 5` might represent the identity permutation of size 5?  
But identity in array form is `[0,1,2,3,4]`, not `None`. But maybe `None` means "not computed yet". But `__invert__` directly passes `self._array_form` to `_af_invert`.  

If `self._array_form` is `None`, `_af_invert(None)` might return `None`. Then `_af_new(None)` might create a new Permutation with `_size` same as self's `_size`? Actually, `_af_new` doesn't have self; it's class method.  

Better guess: The `Permutation` class constructor might set `_size = len(array_form)` if array_form given, else `_size` is given explicitly? Possibly the `__invert__` method returns `Permutation(_af_invert(self.array_form), size=self._size)`. Then if `self.array_form = None`, the inverse's array_form is `None` but size is same.

So in the output, the inverse has `_array_form = None` and `_size = 5`.  
Thus the input `self` must have `_array_form = None`, `_size = 5`.

---

**Step 5: Fill in the structure**  

Structure given:  

```json
{
    "self": {
        "_array_form": XXX,
        "_size": XXX
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

We fill:  
`"_array_form": null`  
`"_size": 5`  

Because inverse's output equals input here (the `__invert__` of a permutation with `_array_form = None` returns same form).

---

[THOUGHT]
1. The output after inversion has `_array_form = null` and `_size = 5`.
2. `__invert__` passes `self._array_form` to `_af_invert` to compute inverse's array form. If `self._array_form` is null, the inverse's array form will also be null (assuming `_af_invert` handles None by returning None).
3. `_size` is preserved in inversion: the inverse permutation has same size as original.
4. Therefore, original `self` must have `_array_form = null` and `_size = 5`.
5. Fill structure accordingly.
