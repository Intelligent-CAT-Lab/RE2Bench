We have output: true  
The function add_heading returns True if successful, False otherwise.  
It works by opening a Document at self.file_path, adding a heading with given text and level, and saving.  
For it to return True, the file_path must exist and be a valid .docx file (or new), and heading must be provided.  
We don't know exact heading or file path from output alone, but must choose something that's plausible.  
Let's pick a realistic file path and a heading.  
Given output true, any valid inputs will work:  
- file_path: "report.docx"  
- heading: "Introduction"  
- level defaults to 1, not in args since it's not required.
