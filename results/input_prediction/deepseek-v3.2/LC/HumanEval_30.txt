The function `get_positive` filters a list `l` to keep only elements greater than 0.  
Given output is `[4, 5, 6]`, the input list must have contained `4`, `5`, and `6`, but might also have contained non-positive numbers or positive numbers not in the output.  
Since only the positive numbers are kept, other elements like 0, -1, 7, etc., could have been present but not included in the output.  
A minimal valid input is just `[4, 5, 6]`.  
Possible to add other positive numbers too, but to exactly match the output, we need only `4, 5, 6`.  
So `l = [4, 5, 6]` works.
