Looking at the output, it's a list of strings resulting from splitting some text by a pattern. The output is: `["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]`.  
That means the pattern matched at the very beginning (first empty string), between " abiguygusu " and " kjgufwycs " (the pattern matches there), and at the very end (last empty string).  
So the pattern is likely something like a comma or semicolon, and the text might be something like `", abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,"` — but here we see spaces around the words inside the result elements.  

Let’s simulate:  
If `text = ", abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,"` and `pattern = ","`, splitting by comma yields:  
`["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]`. Yes — the first empty before first comma, second element `" abiguygusu "` (with leading space because the original text had space after comma), third element `" kjgufwycs "`, last empty after last comma.  

Matches exactly the given output.  

Thus `pattern = ","`, `text = ", abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,"`.
