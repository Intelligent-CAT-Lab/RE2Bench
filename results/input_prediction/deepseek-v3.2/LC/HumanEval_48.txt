First, analyzing the function `is_palindrome`:
- It checks each character from start to end against the corresponding character from the end.
- If any mismatch is found, it returns `False`.
- If all match, it returns `True`.

The output given is `false`, meaning the function returned `False`.  
So there must be at least one position `i` where `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.

The input `text` must be a string that is **not** a palindrome.  
Any non-palindromic string will work.  
The simplest example: `"ab"` — for length 2:  
- `i = 0`: `'a' != 'b'` → `False` returned.

But the problem expects *the* input. Since we only know the output, there are infinitely many possible inputs, but we need one specific one that matches the function's logic and output.  
Given no further constraints in the output, I’ll choose the shortest and simplest non-palindromic string.

So: `text = "ab"` will make the function return `False`.
