Let’s reason through this carefully.

The Python code defines a `RegexUtils` class with a method `match` that uses `re.match`.  
`re.match` returns a match object if the pattern matches **from the start** of the string; otherwise, `None`.  
Here the method converts that to `True` if there is a match, `False` if not.  
Output says `"output": false`, meaning `re.match` returned `None` (no match from the start).  

Possible reasons for no match:
- Pattern doesn’t match the string at all from the start.
- Pattern is invalid regex (but then Python would raise exception, so unlikely here).
- Pattern just doesn't match the given string’s beginning.

The problem doesn’t give constraints beyond the structure, so we must pick any `(pattern, text)` that yields `False` for `re.match`.  
Simplest example: `pattern="^a"`, `text="b"` → no match → `False`.

Given the `self: {}` in structure, we can ignore instance attributes.

So: `pattern` = `"^a"`, `text` = `"b"` → `match` returns `False`.

[THOUGHT]
The `match` method returns True only if the regex matches from the beginning of the string. The given output is false, so any pattern that does not match the text from the start works. For simplicity, choose pattern "^a" and text "b". re.match("^a", "b") returns None → method returns False.
