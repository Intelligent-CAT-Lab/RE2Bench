1. The function `dup_l1_norm(f, K)` returns the sum of absolute values of coefficients in `f` computed in domain `K`.  
2. The output is given as `3`. That means:  

   - If `f` is `[]`, the output would be `K.zero` → probably `0`. But here it's `3`, so `f` is not empty.  
   - So `dup_abs(f, K)` produces absolute values of coefficients according to `K.abs`.  
   - Then `K.sum` adds them up.  

3. We must deduce `f` and `K` so that the sum of absolute coefficients is `3`.  
4. `K` must be a domain with:  
   - `zero` = 0 (since `start=self.zero` in sum starts from zero)  
   - `abs` method that returns the absolute value in that domain. Likely `ZZ` (integers) since output `3` is an integer.  

5. Simple `f`: For example `[1, -2]` in `ZZ` gives `abs(1) + abs(-2)` = `1 + 2 = 3`.  
   - Also `dup_abs([1, -2], ZZ)` → `[1, 2]`  
   - `ZZ.sum([1, 2])` = `1 + 2 = 3`.  

6. Could also be `[3]` → absolute coefficients `[3]`, sum = `3`. But maybe they want multiple coefficients to exercise the loop in `K.sum`. From the simpler test perspective, `[3]` is also valid. Let's pick `[1, -2]` since it shows `abs` applied to both positive and negative coefficients.  

7. Represent `K` as domain `ZZ` (integers). In SymPy polys domains, `K` is an instance of a domain like `ZZ`. In the structure, `K` should be a reference to `ZZ` from the domain system. But in JSON, we can only encode raw structure — unless placeholders suggest a symbol. Since no imports given beyond `Domain`, likely input uses a domain instance named `ZZ`.   

But looking at the `[STRUCTURE]`, `K` is a placeholder XXX — they probably expect a domain instance or a symbolic reference like `ZZ`. But in the given Python code, `from sympy.polys.domains.domain import Domain, Er, Ef, Eeuclid, Eabs, Eordered`, so `ZZ` must be imported elsewhere. Possibly `K` is `ZZ` in the test context.  

Since `ZZ.abs` is normal integer absolute value, let's choose `f=[1, -2]`.
