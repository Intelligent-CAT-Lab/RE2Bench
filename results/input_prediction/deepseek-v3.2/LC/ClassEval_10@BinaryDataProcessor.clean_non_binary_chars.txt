Let’s reason this out step-by-step.

The method `clean_non_binary_chars` takes `self.binary_string`, filters out any characters that are not `'0'` or `'1'`, and reassigns it.  
The output given is `null` (in JSON terms, that’s `None` in Python).  

The method `clean_non_binary_chars` does not return anything — it only modifies `self.binary_string`. In Python, a method that doesn’t return anything implicitly returns `None`.  

So for the *output* to be `None`, we just need the method to run, no matter what the `binary_string` content is — but the output doesn’t tell us about the final `binary_string`.  
Since `clean_non_binary_chars` modifies `self.binary_string` to contain only '0'/'1', if `binary_string` starts as `"1010a01b"`, after the method it will be `"101001"`, but the *return value* (output) is still `None`.  

However, the *input structure* here asks for `self.binary_string` before the method runs. Since the output gives no clue about what it becomes, `self.binary_string` could be **any string**, because no matter what the content is, the output of the method is `None`.  

But the code’s `__init__` sets `self.binary_string` to the argument `binary_string` and immediately calls `clean_non_binary_chars`. That means by the time `clean_non_binary_chars` is called explicitly, `self.binary_string` may already be cleaned if `__init__` ran earlier.  

Since we are asked for the input to `clean_non_binary_chars` specifically — and not as part of `__init__` — and the output is `None`, there’s nothing to deduce about the starting `binary_string`. It could be any string, but in the simplest test case, probably `binary_string` is `""` or `"101"` or anything — the method returns `None` in all cases.  

Looking at the given examples, the output being `null` means the method returned nothing, so the initial `binary_string` could be anything — let’s pick a simple example like `"10101"` since it’s already clean.  

Thus:  
`self.binary_string` before the method call = `"10101"`.
