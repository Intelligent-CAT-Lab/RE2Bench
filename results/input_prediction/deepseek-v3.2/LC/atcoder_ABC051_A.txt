Let's break it down.  

The program reads one line of input and then prints it after replacing every comma `,` with a space `' '`.  

The given output is: `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`  

If we reverse the process, the output has only spaces (no commas), so the replacement may not be visible in the output. But actually, the transformation is `input().replace(',', ' ')`. So if the output has spaces where the input had commas, we can work backward.  

Let's see if that's the case:  

`avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc` — this has two spaces.  
That means the input had two commas replaced with spaces, so the original input likely looked like:  

`avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc`  

Because applying `replace(',', ' ')` would turn commas into spaces, giving `avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc`.  

Check:  
- Input `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"` → replace commas with spaces → `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"` ✅  

It matches the output exactly.  

So the input should be `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`.  

[THOUGHT]  
We can find the input by reversing the replace(',', ' ') operation: output spaces correspond to input commas. Since the output has two spaces separating three words, the input should have two commas in the same positions.  

Thus, input = `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`.

    "input": "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
