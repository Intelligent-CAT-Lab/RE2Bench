[THOUGHT]
Looking at the provided code:
- The `restock_item` method returns `False` if the item_name is NOT in the inventory.
- The output is `false`, meaning the item was not found in the inventory.
- The structure shows the inventory currently has "Coke".
- Therefore, the item_name being restocked must be something other than "Coke".
- The quantity can be any number since it doesn't affect the return value when the item doesn't exist.
- The balance doesn't affect this method.
