The code snippet defines a `JobMarketplace` class with a `withdraw_resume` method. This method simply removes a given `resume` from the `self.resumes` list and returns `None` (implicitly). The provided output is `null`, which in Python corresponds to `None` – the expected return value of this method. This means the removal was successful, so the `resume` must have existed in the `self.resumes` list before the call. Therefore, to fill the structure, I need to define an initial state (`self.resumes` and `self.job_listings`) where the given resume is present in `self.resumes`. I can choose any arbitrary, consistent values for the resume fields and the listings.  

Let's construct them:  
- `self.job_listings`: I'll make it an empty list for simplicity.  
- `self.resumes`: I'll create a list containing one dictionary representing the resume to be removed.  
- `args["resume"]`: The same dictionary, which must match one in `self.resumes` for removal to work without error.  

I'll define a resume with `name`: "Alice", `skills`: ["Python", "Data Analysis"], and `experience`: 2 years.  

So, after removal, `self.resumes` becomes empty, and the method returns `None`.
