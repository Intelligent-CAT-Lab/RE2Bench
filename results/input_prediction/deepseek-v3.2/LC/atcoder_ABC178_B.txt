[THOUGHT]  
The program reads four integers \(a, b, c, d\) from input, computes all four possible products \(a \times c\), \(a \times d\), \(b \times c\), \(b \times d\), and prints the maximum.  

Given output = 56183721947132200, which is very large. We need integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that the maximum of those four products equals this number.  

Let's denote \(a, b, c, d\) as integers (could be positive or negative). The max could come from different sign combinations. But since the result is positive and very large, likely all four products are positive or at least the maximum is positive. The simplest case: all four integers are positive, then the maximum product is simply \(\max(a, b) \times \max(c, d)\) if signs are same and positive.  

But if signs differ, products could be negative or positive, so we must find one combination that yields exactly 56183721947132200 as the maximum among the four.  

We can try to factor the number:  
56183721947132200.  
Let's check divisibility by small primes: ends with 00, so divisible by 100 = \(2^2 \times 5^2\).  
Divide by 100: 561837219471322.  

Even? Yes, so divide by 2: 280918609735661.  

Now 280918609735661 is odd. Check divisibility by 3: sum digits = 2+8+0+9+1+8+6+0+9+7+3+5+6+6+1 = 71, not divisible by 3.  
Try divisibility by 5: ends with 1, no.  

We could try to factor it further, but maybe the intended input uses smaller numbers that multiply directly to 56183721947132200 in one of the four products.  

Let’s suppose \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(c\) and \(d\) are positive, and \(a\) and \(b\) are close together, \(c\) and \(d\) are close together. Then the max product is \(a \times d\) or \(b \times c\) depending on order.  

The simplest case: choose \(a = b\) and \(c = d\), then all products are same, so output = \(a \times c\).  

Let \(a = b = m\), \(c = d = n\), then \(m \times n = 56183721947132200\).  
We can pick m = 1, n = 56183721947132200, but then \(a, b, c, d\) = 1, 1, 56183721947132200, 56183721947132200.  
That works:  
\(a \times c = 56183721947132200\)  
\(a \times d = 56183721947132200\)  
\(b \times c = 56183721947132200\)  
\(b \times d = 56183721947132200\)  
max = 56183721947132200 ✅  

But the problem expects four integers input in one line separated by spaces. So input:  
`1 1 56183721947132200 56183721947132200`  

But let's check: 56183721947132200 is within Python's integer range (unbounded).  

Alternatively, we could pick \(a = 56183721947132200, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1\)? Then max product = max(56183721947132200, 56183721947132200, 1, 1) = 56183721947132200.  

Thus many possibilities. But the simplest consistent with the output:  
We need at least one of the four products = 56183721947132200, and all others ≤ that number.  

So we can choose \(a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 56183721947132200\)? Let's test:  
ac = 1  
ad = 56183721947132200  
bc = 1  
bd = 56183721947132200  
max = 56183721947132200 ✅  

That’s simpler: \(a=1, b=1, c=1, d=56183721947132200\). Input: `1 1 1 56183721947132200`.  

We must check if code runs with that input.  

Let’s verify: split() on input, map to int. Python can handle big integers.  

We could also have negatives: e.g., a=-1, b=-1, c=1, d=-56183721947132200? Then products: ac=-1, ad=56183721947132200, bc=-1, bd=56183721947132200 → max=56183721947132200 ✅  

But simplest is all positive and one product equal to the output and others smaller.  

I’ll pick a = 1, b = 0, c = 56183721947132200, d = 0: then products: 56183721947132200, 0, 0, 0 → max = 56183721947132200 ✅. Input: `1 0 56183721947132200 0`.  

Even simpler: a = 56183721947132200, b = anything less or equal, c = 1, d = anything ≤1: products: a*c = 56183721947132200, a*d ≤ that, b*c ≤ that, b*d ≤ that.  

Let’s pick a = 56183721947132200, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0 → same as above with a,c swapped.  

I’ll go with `1 0 56183721947132200 0`.  

But is it guaranteed that the input must be in that form? The problem says "predict the input" given output; in example, they gave one possible input. I'll provide one possible valid input.  

Maybe they expect the input that leads to output exactly, and the simplest is a=b=c=1, d=output.  

Let’s check: a=1, b=1, c=1, d=56183721947132200.  

All products: 1, 56183721947132200, 1, 56183721947132200. Works.  

Choose that.  

Thus input: `1 1 1 56183721947132200`.  

I’ll write it in JSON.
