Let's reason through the code step-by-step.

The program reads input via `input().split()` and maps each part to an integer, storing them in a tuple `ABC`. Then it checks if the count of the number 5 in the tuple is exactly 2. If yes, it checks whether the sum of the tuple is 17. If the sum is 17, it prints 'YES'; else 'NO'. If the count of 5 is not 2, it prints 'NO' directly.

Given the output is "YES", we know two conditions must have been met:
1. `ABC.count(5) == 2`
2. `sum(ABC) == 17`

Thus, the tuple must contain exactly two 5's and the sum of the three numbers is 17.

Let the three numbers be a, b, c. Without loss of generality, assume two of them are 5, and the third is x. Then:
5 + 5 + x = 17 → 10 + x = 17 → x = 7.

So the tuple could be (5, 5, 7) in any order.

The input is provided as space-separated integers. So any permutation of 5, 5, 7 will work.

Thus, the input could be "5 5 7", "5 7 5", or "7 5 5".

We need to choose one valid input. The structure expects a placeholder XXX. We'll pick one, say "5 5 7".

Hence, the input JSON will be:
{
    "input": "5 5 7"
}

Let's verify: ABC = (5,5,7). count(5) = 2 → condition satisfied. sum = 17 → prints YES. Correct.
