The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` returns `True` if `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`.  
From the output `true`, we know both conditions are satisfied:  
- `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`),  
- `n` is greater than or equal to 8.  

So `n` could be any even integer ≥ 8.  
Without further constraints, the simplest valid integer is 8.
