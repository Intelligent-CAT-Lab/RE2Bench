Let’s reason through the code step by step.  

The code:  
1. Takes a space-separated input string, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each to an integer.  
2. Stores the first two integers as `a` and `b`.  
3. Prints the minimum of the list, then a space, then:  
   - If `abs(a - b) >= 2`, prints `abs(a - b) // 2`.  
   - Else prints `0`.  

Given the output is `1 0`:  
- The first printed number is `min(x) = 1`.  
So in the list, the smallest integer must be `1`.  

Second printed number is `0`. That happens when `abs(a - b) < 2`.  
So `a` and `b` differ by 0 or 1.  

`a = x[0]` and `b = x[1]`.  

Possible pairs:  
- If `a = 1`, `b` could be `1` or `2`.  
- If `a = 2`, `b` could be `1`, but then `min(x)` would be `1`, so `1` must be somewhere in the list.  

But `x` only contains the integers from the input, so `min(x)` being `1` means at least one of the numbers is `1`.  

If input has two numbers, `x = [a, b]`.  
Case 1: `a = 1, b = 1`. Then `abs(a - b) = 0 < 2`, prints `0`. Output: `1 0` ✅  
Case 2: `a = 1, b = 2`. Then `abs(a - b) = 1 < 2`, prints `0`. Output: `1 0` ✅  
Case 3: `a = 2, b = 1`. Same as above, `min(x) = 1`. Output: `1 0` ✅  

So possible inputs:  
`1 1`, `1 2`, `2 1`.  

But we must consider if there could be more than two numbers in `x`?  
Yes — the `input().split()` could give more than two items.  
Then `a = x[0]`, `b = x[1]`, but `min(x)` could be smaller than `a`.  
But here `min(x) = 1`, so maybe `a` or `b` could be bigger, but `abs(a - b) // 2` is never triggered since we got output `0`.  

Actually, for example: `x = [3, 1, 5]` → `a = 3, b = 1`, `abs(a - b) = 2` → `>= 2`, prints `2 // 2 = 1`. So output would be `1 1` not `1 0`. So to get `1 0`, we need `abs(a - b) <= 1`.  

If there are more than two numbers, `min(x)` could be `1` from some later position, but `a` and `b` still determine the second output.  

Example: `x = [5, 6, 1]`:  
`a = 5, b = 6`, `abs(a - b) = 1` → prints `0`. Output: `1 0` ✅  

But in this case, the input would be `5 6 1`.  

But also `x = [5, 5, 1]` → `abs(a - b) = 0` → prints `0`. Output: `1 0` ✅  

So many possibilities. However, the simplest input meeting the output `1 0` with minimal length: `1 1`.  

Since the problem only requires one valid input, we can choose the simplest.  

**Final choice**: `"1 1"`
