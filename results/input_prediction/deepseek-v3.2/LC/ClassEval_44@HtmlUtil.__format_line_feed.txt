[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `__format_line_feed` method:

1. The method takes a `text` parameter
2. It uses `re.sub()` to replace multiple consecutive newlines (`\n`) with a single newline
3. The pattern `'\\n+'` matches one or more newline characters in sequence
4. The replacement is `'\n'` (a single newline)

However, the given output is `"Some sentence here."` which contains no newlines at all.
This means the input text must either:
- Have no newlines to begin with (so the substitution does nothing)
- Or have multiple consecutive newlines that get reduced to single newlines, but the output shows no newlines

Since the output contains no newlines, the input text must also contain no newlines, or any consecutive newlines would result in at least one newline in the output.

The method `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)` only affects sequences of newlines. If the input has no newlines at all, the substitution does nothing and returns the original text.

Therefore, the input `text` must simply be `"Some sentence here."` without any newlines.
