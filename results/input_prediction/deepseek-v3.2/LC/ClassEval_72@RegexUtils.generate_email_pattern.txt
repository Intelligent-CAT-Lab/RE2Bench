The method `generate_email_pattern` takes no arguments (self, but no other args or kwargs). It returns a hard-coded pattern string. The output matches exactly the pattern defined in the method. Therefore, the input is empty. However, note that the method is an instance method, so we need to call it on an instance. But the self object is passed implicitly; the input structure expects "self": {} which means an instance with no particular attributes. The args and kwargs are empty.

Thus, the input is:

{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
