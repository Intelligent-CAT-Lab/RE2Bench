Let’s go step by step.

The function is:  
```python
def f(num):
    num.append(num[-1])
    return num
```

Output given:  
```
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]
```

---

**Step 1 — Understanding the operation**  
`num.append(num[-1])` takes the last element of `num` and appends it to `num`.  
So if the input list was `[a, b, c, d]`, the output will be `[a, b, c, d, d]`.

---

**Step 2 — From output to input**  
Output: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`  
Since the last element of output is `1` and it was appended,  
the second-last element in output was the original last element.  
That means the last two elements in output are `1, 1`, where the first `1` was in the original list at the last position, and the second `1` is the copy.

So the original list before appending must have been:  
`[-70, 20, 9, 1]`

---

**Step 3 — Check**  
Input: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`  
`num[-1]` = `1`  
Append `1` → `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` ✅
