Let's analyze the given output.  

The function returns a tuple `(max(smallest), min(largest))` where:  
- `smallest` = list of negative integers from `lst`.  
- `largest` = list of positive integers from `lst`.  

Output is `[-1, null]`.  
So:  
1. `max(smallest) = -1`. That means the list of negative integers must contain -1, and -1 must be the largest among them (largest negative number means closest to zero). So there could be only -1, or other negatives less than -1.  
2. `min(largest) = None` (`null` in JSON). That means the list of positive integers is empty. So `lst` contains no positive numbers.  

So `lst` must contain negative numbers (at least one, including -1), possibly zero, but no positive numbers.  

Example: `lst = [-1]` or `lst = [-5, -1, 0]`.  
Let's check `[-5, -1, 0]`:  
- Negatives = [-5, -1], max = -1 ✓  
- Positives = [], min = None ✓  

That matches the output.  
Other possibilities: `[-3, -1]` also works.  

We need to choose one simplest input that satisfies. Minimal example: `[-1]` works fine.  

Thus `lst = [-1]`.
