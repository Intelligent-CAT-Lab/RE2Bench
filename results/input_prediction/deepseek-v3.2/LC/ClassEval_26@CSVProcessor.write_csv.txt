We’re told that the output of `write_csv` is `1`, which means the function succeeded (since on error it returns 0).  

The function takes `data` (list of rows) and `file_name`, writes them to a CSV file, and returns 1 on success.  

Because `writer.writerows(data)` writes all rows exactly as provided, there’s no transformation of the data — we can’t directly infer the exact `data` and `file_name` from the output `1` alone, but we need plausible inputs that would succeed.  

`file_name` just needs to be a valid path where the user has write permission. `data` must be an iterable of iterables (each row being a list/tuple).  

Simplest working example: any valid CSV data and a dummy filename.  

Given no constraints, choose minimal example that works: `data = [["a","b"]]` and `file_name = "out.csv"` would succeed and return `1`.  

We just have to fill placeholders accordingly.  

[THOUGHT]  
The method `write_csv` returns 1 if writing succeeds.  
We can pick any valid `data` (list of lists) and a filename string that is writable.  
Since we only know output is 1, many inputs possible. Choose simplest: `data = [["test"]]`, `file_name = "test.csv"`.
