1. The output string "int | None" is a binary operation with left operand "int", operator "|", and right operand "None".
2. In Python AST, this corresponds to an `ast.BinOp` node with left as `ast.Name(id="int", ctx=Load())`, op as `ast.BitOr()`, and right as `ast.Constant(value=None)`.
3. The `visit_BinOp` method joins the string representations of left, op, and right. Since the operator is not `ast.Pow`, it joins with spaces, resulting in "int | None".
4. The structure requires specific fields for the node. For left (Name), we provide id="int", ctx as empty dict (since context is not detailed), and line/column numbers. We set left to start at column 0, end at column 3 (since "int" has length 3).
5. For right (Constant), value is null (None), kind is null. We set its start column after the operator and space, so column 6, and end at column 10 (since "None" has length 4).
6. The BinOp node spans from column 0 to 10, line 1.
7. The operator field is left as empty dict as per structure.
8. The self.code field is not used in the method, so set to empty string.
9. kwargs is empty.
