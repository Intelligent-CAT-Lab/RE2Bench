Let’s reason this out step by step.  

The given Python code defines a `CalendarUtil` class with:  
- `__init__`: initializes `self.events` as an empty list.  
- `add_event(self, event)`: appends `event` to `self.events`, and returns nothing (`None`), hence output is `null` in JSON.  

The `output` is `null`, which means the function executed without returning anything (just appended).  

From the structure given, we need to fill in `"self"` with initial `events` **before** `add_event` is called, and fill in `"args"` for `event`.  

But `self.events` before `add_event` could be anything — likely the empty list `[]` since we usually call `add_event` on a newly created instance unless otherwise specified.  

For `event`, it must match the expected format in the `args` structure given: keys `"date"`, `"start_time"`, `"end_time"`, `"description"`.  
Since the only constraint is that after calling `add_event` the output is `null`, we can choose any reasonable event data.  

Let’s pick a simple example:  

- `"date"`: `"2024-12-25"`  
- `"start_time"`: `"10:00"`  
- `"end_time"`: `"12:00"`  
- `"description"`: `"Christmas Party"`  

So:  

- `self.events` initially `[]`  
- `event` as above  

[THOUGHT]
The function add_event simply appends the given event to self.events and returns None (output null). The initial self.events is likely [] since we are adding an event for the first time. The event must fit the structure given: date, start_time, end_time, description. Any valid example works. I'll choose a simple one.
