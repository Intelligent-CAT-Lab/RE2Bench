The function `parse` takes a string `version` and returns either a `Version` or `LegacyVersion` object. The output shows `<Version('1.11.3')>`, which means `parse` successfully created a `Version` object for the version string "1.11.3". 

Looking at the `Version` class initialization, it uses a regex to parse the version string. The output format suggests that the input version string was "1.11.3", which is a valid semantic version that matches the regex pattern.

The `parse` function simply calls `Version(version)` and falls back to `LegacyVersion` if it fails. Since we got a `Version` object, the input must be a valid version string that the `Version` class can parse. The output shows the version is "1.11.3", so that should be the input.

The structure requires the input to be provided as:
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "version": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
So I need to fill in XXX with "1.11.3".
