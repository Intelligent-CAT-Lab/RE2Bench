The output SQL is: "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"

Breaking down the SQL structure:
- "SELECT *" indicates no specific fields were provided (matches the default behavior when fields=None)
- "FROM table1" indicates self.table_name = "table1"
- "WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20" indicates condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"

Looking at the kwargs structure, I need to provide:
- table_name for self
- condition for kwargs (since fields is not mentioned in the kwargs section, it should remain None)

The args is an empty dictionary as expected since select() doesn't have positional arguments beyond self.
