Let's go through this step-by-step.  

We have the `ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2)` method which returns `c1 - c2` as a `complex` number.  
The output is `(2-2j)`, which means `real = 2`, `imag = -2`.  

The function computes:  
`real = c1.real - c2.real`  
`imag = c1.imag - c2.imag`  

So:  
`c1.real - c2.real = 2`  
`c1.imag - c2.imag = -2`  

We need to find **any** pair of complex numbers `(c1, c2)` that satisfy these equations.  
There are infinitely many possibilities; the simplest is to try small integer values.  

Let’s pick `c1.imag = 0`, `c2.imag = 2` (since `0 - 2 = -2`, works).  
Let’s pick `c1.real = 2`, `c2.real = 0` (since `2 - 0 = 2`, works).  

So `c1 = 2 + 0j` (i.e., `2`)  
`c2 = 0 + 2j` (i.e., `2j`).  

Let’s verify:  
`(2 + 0j) - (0 + 2j) = 2 - 2j` ✅  

[THOUGHT]
The output `(2-2j)` is a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -2.
The subtract method does c1 - c2 = (c1.real - c2.real) + (c1.imag - c2.imag)j.
Choose c1.real=2, c2.real=0 → real diff = 2.
Choose c1.imag=0, c2.imag=2 → imag diff = -2.
Thus c1 = 2+0j = 2, c2 = 0+2j = 2j.
