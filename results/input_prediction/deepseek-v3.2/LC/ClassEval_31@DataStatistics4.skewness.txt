Let's walk through the problem step-by-step.  

The function `skewness` returns 0. The skewness formula used is:  

\[
\text{skewness} = \frac{n \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^3}{(n-1)(n-2) \cdot \text{std\_dev}^3}
\]
with `std_dev` = \(\sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}\).  

If the output is exactly 0, the numerator \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^3\) must be zero because the denominator is nonzero when \(n>2\) and data aren't all identical if variance nonzero — but variance could also be zero, giving `std_dev = 0`, in which case the code returns 0 early.  

That means two possible cases:  

1. Data symmetric around mean so sum of cubed deviations = 0, but variance nonzero.  
2. All data points equal → variance = 0 → skewness returns 0 automatically.  

Given the simplest possible input that gives skewness = 0, the easiest case is all equal numbers, e.g., `[5,5,5]`. Let's test:  
- n = 3, mean = 5  
- variance = 0, std_dev = 0  
- code branch: `if std_dev != 0 else 0` → returns 0.  

So `data = [5, 5, 5]` works. But other symmetric sets like `[1, 2, 3]` also give 0 skewness? Let’s check: mean=2, deviations [-1,0,1], cubes [-1,0,1] → sum=0 → skewness numerator 0 → returns 0.  

Given there’s no requirement of variance nonzero in output, simplest choice: a symmetric dataset, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.  

But `[1, 2, 3]` is small, not all equal, still gives 0. That’s more plausible as a generic test case than all equal numbers, which trivializes. But the problem statement doesn’t suggest any preference.  

Let’s pick `[1, 2, 3]` as a minimal symmetric set with n ≥ 3.  

[THOUGHT]
The output is 0. Skewness can be 0 if:
- Standard deviation is 0 (all data equal).
- Sum of cubed deviations is 0 (symmetric distribution).
Choosing a symmetric set with small length: data = [1, 2, 3] yields mean = 2, deviations [-1,0,1], cubes [-1,0,1] sum to 0, so skewness = 0. This satisfies the output.
