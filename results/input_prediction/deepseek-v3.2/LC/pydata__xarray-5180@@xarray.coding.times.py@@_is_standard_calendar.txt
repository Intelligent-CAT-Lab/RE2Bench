Let's trace through the logic step by step.  

The function `_is_standard_calendar(calendar)` checks if `calendar.lower()` is in `_STANDARD_CALENDARS`, which is:  

```python
_STANDARD_CALENDARS = {'standard', 'gregorian', 'proleptic_gregorian'}
```

The given output is `true`, which means the function returned `True`.  
That implies the argument `calendar` passed to the function, when lowercased, must be one of `"standard"`, `"gregorian"`, or `"proleptic_gregorian"`.  

Since the input structure only has `"calendar"` in args, I need to choose any one of those three (case-insensitive).  
For simplicity, I’ll pick `"gregorian"`.  

[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `true`, meaning the calendar passed is recognized as standard.
2. The standard calendars are 'standard', 'gregorian', 'proleptic_gregorian'.
3. I'll choose `"gregorian"` as the input (lowercase would match exactly).
