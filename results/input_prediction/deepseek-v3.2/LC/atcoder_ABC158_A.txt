Let's analyze the code step by step:  

1. The program reads `stdin` from `input()` and stores it in variable `s`.  
2. It checks if the string `s` contains **both** 'A' and 'B'.  
3. If both are present, `result` is set to `"Yes"`, otherwise `"No"`.  
4. The given output is `"Yes"`, so `s` must contain both 'A' and 'B'.  

Thus, any input string containing both `A` and `B` will produce `"Yes"`.  
The simplest possible is `"AB"`.
