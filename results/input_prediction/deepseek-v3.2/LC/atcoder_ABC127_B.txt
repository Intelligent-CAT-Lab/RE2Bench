Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code reads a line of input, splits it, and maps to three integers: `r`, `D`, `x`. Then it runs a loop 10 times, each time updating `x` by `x = r * x - D` and prints the new `x`.

Given the output lines: 110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220.

We need to find `r`, `D`, and the initial `x` (let's call it `x0`) such that iterating the recurrence `x_{n+1} = r * x_n - D` produces the given sequence.

Let the sequence be:
x1 = 110
x2 = 120
x3 = 140
x4 = 180
x5 = 260
x6 = 420
x7 = 740
x8 = 1380
x9 = 2660
x10 = 5220

These are the values printed in each iteration. Note that the first printed value is after one iteration: the code sets `x = r * x - D` and then prints `x`. So if we denote the input `x` as `x0`, then:
x1 = r * x0 - D
x2 = r * x1 - D
and so on.

We have to solve for r, D, and x0.

We can use the first two equations:

(1) r * x0 - D = 110
(2) r * 110 - D = 120

Subtract (1) from (2)? Actually, let's solve for r and D using two consecutive steps.

From (2): D = r * 110 - 120.
Plug into (1): r * x0 - (r * 110 - 120) = 110  => r * x0 - r * 110 + 120 = 110 => r*(x0 - 110) = -10 => r*(x0 - 110) = -10.

But we have more data. Let's compute r from differences or ratios? Since recurrence is linear, we can compute r by looking at differences between successive terms? Actually, note that:

x_{n+1} - x_n = (r * x_n - D) - x_n = (r-1) x_n - D.

Alternatively, we can compute r by taking:

x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = r (x_{n+1} - x_n).

Check: 
x_{n+2} = r * x_{n+1} - D
x_{n+1} = r * x_n - D
Subtract: x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = r (x_{n+1} - x_n).

So the differences follow a geometric progression with ratio r.

Let's compute differences:
d1 = x2 - x1 = 120 - 110 = 10
d2 = x3 - x2 = 140 - 120 = 20
d3 = x4 - x3 = 180 - 140 = 40
d4 = x5 - x4 = 260 - 180 = 80
d5 = x6 - x5 = 420 - 260 = 160
d6 = x7 - x6 = 740 - 420 = 320
d7 = x8 - x7 = 1380 - 740 = 640
d8 = x9 - x8 = 2660 - 1380 = 1280
d9 = x10 - x9 = 5220 - 2660 = 2560

We see each difference is double the previous: 10, 20, 40, 80, ... Indeed, ratio = 2. So r = 2.

Check: d2/d1 = 20/10=2, d3/d2=40/20=2, etc. So r = 2.

Now we have r=2. Then we can compute D from equation (2): D = r * x1 - x2? Wait careful: equation (2) is x2 = r * x1 - D => D = r * x1 - x2 = 2*110 - 120 = 220 - 120 = 100.

Check with another step: x3 = r * x2 - D => 140 = 2*120 - D => 140 = 240 - D => D = 100. Yes.

Now we can find x0 from x1 = r * x0 - D => 110 = 2 * x0 - 100 => 2*x0 = 210 => x0 = 105.

Let's verify the entire sequence:

x0 = 105
x1 = 2*105 - 100 = 210 - 100 = 110
x2 = 2*110 - 100 = 220 - 100 = 120
x3 = 2*120 - 100 = 240 - 100 = 140
x4 = 2*140 - 100 = 280 - 100 = 180
x5 = 2*180 - 100 = 360 - 100 = 260
x6 = 2*260 - 100 = 520 - 100 = 420
x7 = 2*420 - 100 = 840 - 100 = 740
x8 = 2*740 - 100 = 1480 - 100 = 1380
x9 = 2*1380 - 100 = 2760 - 100 = 2660
x10 = 2*2660 - 100 = 5320 - 100 = 5220

Matches perfectly.

Thus the input values are r=2, D=100, x=105.

The input format: "r D x" as a single line with three integers separated by spaces. So input string: "2 100 105"

Check the code: `r, D, x = map(int, input().split())` so input should be "2 100 105".

Therefore, the input JSON structure should have that as the input value.

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "input": XXX
}
```
So XXX should be "2 100 105".

[THOUGHT]
We determined r=2, D=100, x0=105 from the recurrence and the given output sequence. The input should be "2 100 105".
