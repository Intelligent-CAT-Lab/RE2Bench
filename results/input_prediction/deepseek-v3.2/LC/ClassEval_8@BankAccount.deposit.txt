Let's reason through this step by step.  

The method `deposit` adds `amount` to `self.balance` and returns the new balance.  
The output after calling `deposit` is `300`.  

That means:  
`new_balance = initial_balance + amount = 300`  

We don’t know `initial_balance` or `amount` yet, but we can deduce possibilities.  
Important: `amount` must be non‑negative (≥ 0), otherwise a `ValueError` is raised.  

Also, from `__init__`, if no initial balance is provided, it defaults to `0`.  

Given the output is `300`, possible pairs (`initial_balance`, `amount`) could be:  
- `(0, 300)`  
- `(100, 200)`  
- `(200, 100)`  
- `(300, 0)`  
- etc.  

But the problem doesn’t give extra constraints, so the simplest likely intended answer is the case starting from the default balance `0`.  
If `initial_balance` is `0`, then `amount` must be `300` to give output `300`.  

So:  
```
self.balance = 0
args.amount = 300
```
