[THOUGHT]
The output is the string representation of the CheckingClassifier after calling `fit`, showing only `expected_sample_weight=True`. This suggests the instance was initialized with `expected_sample_weight=True` and other parameters at their defaults. The `fit` method doesn't change `expected_sample_weight`, so the input `self` must have `expected_sample_weight=True`. Other attributes like `check_X`, `check_y`, etc., are likely `None` or default, as they don't appear in the output. For `fit` to succeed without error, given `expected_sample_weight=True`, we must provide a valid `sample_weight`. Also, `X` and `y` must have the same number of samples, and `X` must have at least one feature. Simple arrays like `X = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `y = [0, 1]` with `sample_weight = [1, 1]` satisfy these conditions. The `methods_to_check` is set to `'all'` (default), which triggers `_check_X_y`, but since `check_X` and `check_y` are `None`, no additional validation occurs. No `fit_params` are required as `expected_fit_params` is `None`.
