I need to analyze the `restify` function and see what input could produce the given output `:class:`tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"``.  

Looking at the `restify` code:  
- The output looks like a class reference formatted as `:class:`module.name``.  
- This appears to match the branch for classes not in `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`, not `None`, not `Ellipsis`, not a `NewType`, not a `Union`.  
- It seems to fall into the `cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins')` branch? No, because module is `tests.test_util_typing`.  
- Wait, the output shows `:class:`tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"`` — the class name is `"<MyClass2>"` with quotes inside backticks. That's unusual. Let's check possible branches.  

Actually, maybe `isNewType(cls)` returns `True` for some objects? But `isNewType` checks `__module__ == 'typing'` and `__qualname__ == 'NewType.<locals>.new_type'`, not likely here.  

Maybe `cls` is a `ForwardRef`? The function `_restify_py37` (not shown) might handle `ForwardRef` differently, but since output contains `\"<MyClass2>\"`, it seems like a string representation of a class placeholder.  

Given the `restify` function’s structure, the `inspect.isNewType(cls)` branch returns `:class:`%s` % cls.__name__`. If `cls.__name__` is `"<MyClass2>"` and `cls.__module__` is `"tests.test_util_typing"`, then `inspect.isNewType` must return `False`, so `cls.__module__` not in `('__builtin__', 'builtins')`. Then it goes to the `sys.version_info >= (3, 7)` branch, which calls `_restify_py37`.  

But `_restify_py37` is not provided. However, earlier branches don't handle `ForwardRef`, but maybe `_restify_py37` formats `ForwardRef` specially. However, the output `:class:`tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"`` seems to be the result of `:class:`%s.%s`` with module and name — but name includes quotes? Actually `"<MyClass2>"` seems like a `repr` of something, maybe a `ForwardRef` with `_eval_type` not resolved.  

Given the [STRUCTURE] requires `__module__` and `__doc__` keys for `cls`, maybe `cls` is a `ForwardRef` instance with those attributes? `ForwardRef` from typing has `__module__` and `__doc__`.  

Let’s hypothesize: `cls` is a `ForwardRef` with `__module__ == "tests.test_util_typing"` and `__forward_arg__ == "<MyClass2>"`, and `__name__` perhaps also `"<MyClass2>"`. Then `_restify_py37` might produce `:class:`tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"``.  

But since `__doc__` is also asked for, maybe `__doc__` is `None` or something.  

Given minimal context, the most plausible is that `cls` is a `ForwardRef` object with `__module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"` and `__doc__ = None`.  

Let’s check: In Python, `typing.ForwardRef('MyClass2')` has `__forward_arg__ = 'MyClass2'`, `__module__ = 'typing'`. But here `__module__` is given as `"tests.test_util_typing"`, so maybe it’s a custom subclass? Or maybe `cls` is something else entirely?  

Actually, `ForwardRef` might be in `typing`, but `_ForwardRef` (from `typing import _ForwardRef`) could have `__module__` overridden.  

Given the mystery, but the [STRUCTURE] suggests `cls` has `__module__` and `__doc__` attributes, I'll set:  

- `__module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"`  
- `__doc__ = None`  

That fits the output pattern if `_restify_py37` uses `cls.__module__` and `cls.__name__` (which might be `"<MyClass2>"`) to construct the result.  

Thus:

[THOUGHT]
The output `:class:`tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"`` suggests the class name is `"<MyClass2>"` (a string representation with quotes). Likely `cls` is a `ForwardRef` or some placeholder class defined with `__module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"` and `__name__ = "<MyClass2>"`. The `restify` function's `_restify_py37` branch seems to format it as `:class:`{module}.{name}``, escaping quotes inside. Given the [STRUCTURE] asks for `__module__` and `__doc__`, I'll set `__module__` to `"tests.test_util_typing"` and `__doc__` to `None` (common for such placeholder objects).
