Let's simulate the `is_valid_backend` method step by step with the given output `true`.  

The method does the following:  

1. If `backend` starts with `'module://'`, keep it as is, else lowercase it.  
2. Check backwards compatibility dict:  
   - `'module://ipympl.backend_nbagg'` → `'widget'`  
   - `'module://matplotlib_inline.backend_inline'` → `'inline'`  
3. If `backend` is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` → `True`.  
4. If `backend` is in `self._backend_to_gui_framework` → `True`.  
5. If `backend` starts with `'module://'`, add it to `_backend_to_gui_framework` with value `'unknown'` and return `True`.  
6. If none of the above, call `_ensure_entry_points_loaded()`.  
7. Check `self._backend_to_gui_framework` again after loading entry points.  

Given output is `true`, the backend must satisfy one of the early `True` conditions or after loading entry points.  

Looking at the `self` structure:  
- `_loaded_entry_points` can be `true` or `false`.  
- `_backend_to_gui_framework` is given as empty `{}` (must be filled according to logic).  
- `_name_to_module` includes only `"notebook": XXX`. The value for `"notebook"` should match the `__init__` default: `"nbagg"`.  

Possible ways `is_valid_backend` returns `True`:  
A) Backend is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (like `"tkagg"`).  
B) Backend is already in `self._backend_to_gui_framework` (but here it's given as empty, so not unless set earlier).  
C) Backend starts with `'module://'` → add to dict and return `True`.  
D) After loading entry points, backend is in `_backend_to_gui_framework` (requires `_loaded_entry_points=False` so that loading happens and maybe adds it).  

Let's check `_read_entry_points`: It adds `"inline"` and `"ipympl"`/`"widget"` if certain package versions are old, but here we don't know installed packages.  

Given that `_backend_to_gui_framework` starts empty, but `_name_to_module` has `"notebook": "nbagg"`, maybe `"notebook"` is special — but `"notebook"` is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (yes, it's there: `'notebook': 'nbagg'`). So `"notebook"` would be valid immediately without loading entry points.  

Thus `backend` could simply be `"notebook"` (or any other built-in).  

But output `true` can also occur if backend is `"module://something"`. That also returns `True` immediately.  

Since `_backend_to_gui_framework` is given as empty in the structure, it's unlikely to have been pre-filled. So either:  
- `backend` is a built-in, or  
- `backend` starts with `'module://'`, or  
- `_loaded_entry_points=False` and `backend` is in entry points after loading.  

But after loading, entry points are validated and stored in `_backend_to_gui_framework`. For `backend` to be in `_backend_to_gui_framework` after loading but given as empty in the structure, that doesn't match because the structure is the *initial* state.  

So simplest solution: backend is built-in. Let's pick a simple one like `"tkagg"`.  

Checking:  
`"tkagg"` → lowercase `"tkagg"`, not in backwards compat dict, is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`? Yes (`'tkagg': 'tk'`). Returns `True`.  

`_loaded_entry_points` can be `false` initially. `_name_to_module["notebook"]` should be `"nbagg"`.  

Thus:  

```json
{
    "self": {
        "_loaded_entry_points": false,
        "_backend_to_gui_framework": {},
        "_name_to_module": {
            "notebook": "nbagg"
        }
    },
    "args": {
        "backend": "tkagg"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```  

[THOUGHT]  
1. Output is `true`, so `is_valid_backend` returns `True`.  
2. If backend is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`, returns `True` immediately without needing entry points.  
3. `_backend_to_gui_framework` starts empty, so not from there initially.  
4. Could be `"module://..."` case, but built-in is simpler and matches structure constraints.  
5. Pick `"tkagg"` as a built-in backend.  
6. `_loaded_entry_points` must be `false` initially (could be `true` too, doesn't matter).  
7. `_name_to_module["notebook"]` should be default `"nbagg"`.
