1. Looking at the output `"cos(phi)"`, this is a symbolic expression, not a list or matrix. This suggests we took the branch that returns a single scalar value, not an extracted submatrix.

2. The function `_getitem_RepMatrix` has two main execution paths:
   - If `key` is a tuple `(i, j)`: tries to get a single element
   - If `key` is not a tuple: treats it as a flat index

3. Since we're getting a symbolic expression `cos(phi)` as output, this likely came from the single element access path, not the submatrix extraction path.

4. Looking at the tuple branch:
   - First tries `self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j))`
   - If that fails with TypeError/IndexError, it checks if `i` or `j` are non-numeric expressions
   - If they are non-numeric expressions (and out-of-bound checks pass), it returns a `MatrixElement`
   - Otherwise, it does submatrix extraction

5. The output `"cos(phi)"` is not a `MatrixElement` object, so we must have taken the first path: `self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j))` succeeded.

6. `getitem_sympy` calls `domain.to_sympy(self.rep.getitem(i, j))`, and `cos(phi)` is the result of `domain.to_sympy()`. This means the matrix element at position (i, j) contains `cos(phi)` in some domain representation.

7. For `index_(i)` and `index_(j)` to work without raising TypeError, both `i` and `j` must be integers that can be converted via the `index_` function (which is just the built-in `index` function).

8. Therefore, the input `key` should be a tuple of two integers, like `(row, col)` where both row and col are valid integer indices.

9. The matrix dimensions (`rows`, `cols`) should be such that the given indices are within bounds.

10. The `_rep` field should contain a matrix representation that has `cos(phi)` at the specified position.

Let me assume simple integer indices, say (0, 0), and reasonable matrix dimensions like 2x2 or 3x3.
