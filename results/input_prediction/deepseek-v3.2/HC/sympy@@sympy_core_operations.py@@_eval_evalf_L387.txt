[THOUGHT]
1. The output `"-0.e-1"` is a string representation of a floating-point number, specifically a negative zero with exponent -1, indicating very low precision.
2. The function `_eval_evalf` is defined for `AssocOp` subclasses like `Mul` and `Add`, and it evaluates expressions to a given binary precision `prec`.
3. To produce a negative zero float, the expression should involve a multiplication of a negative number and zero, with at least one operand being a float to ensure the result is a float.
4. With low precision (e.g., `prec=1`), the resulting float may have the string representation `-0.e-1`.
5. A suitable expression is `Mul(Float('-1.0', 1), Integer(0))`. When `_eval_evalf(1)` is called on this `Mul` object, it will return a `Float` with value `-0.0` and precision 1, likely represented as `-0.e-1`.
