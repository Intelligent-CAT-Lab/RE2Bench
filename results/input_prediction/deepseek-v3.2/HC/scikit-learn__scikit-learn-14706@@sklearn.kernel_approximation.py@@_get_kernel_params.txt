Let's go step-by-step.

1. Looking at the `_get_kernel_params` method:
   - It first checks if `self.kernel_params` is not None. If it's not None, it starts with that dict.
   - If `self.kernel_params` is None, it starts with an empty dict `{}`.
   - Then, if `self.kernel` is not callable and not 'precomputed', it checks `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` for valid parameters (like `gamma`, `coef0`, `degree`, etc.).
   - For each parameter in that list, if `getattr(self, param)` is not None, it adds it to `params`.
   - Finally, returns `params`.

2. In the given output, we have `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`.  
   This means `params` ends up containing only `coef0` and `degree`.

3. This could happen in two ways:
   - Either `self.kernel_params` already contained exactly `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`.
   - Or `self.kernel_params` was None or empty, and the kernel type was something like `'poly'` (which uses `coef0` and `degree`), and `gamma` was None, so only `coef0` and `degree` got added.

4. But note: `KERNEL_PARAMS` is imported from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`. From sklearn documentation, for `'poly'` kernel, valid parameters are `('gamma', 'coef0', 'degree')`.  
   If `self.gamma` is None, it wouldn't be added. So if kernel is `'poly'`, `gamma=None`, `coef0=0.1`, `degree=3.1`, and `kernel_params=None`, then `_get_kernel_params` would return `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`.

5. Also, the output does not include `gamma`, so either `gamma` is None or kernel_params overrides it. But since kernel_params is initially taken from `self.kernel_params` if not None, and if kernel_params already had `coef0` and `degree`, it wouldn't go into the `if not callable(self.kernel)...` block to add gamma anyway.

6. Let’s test both possibilities:
   - If `kernel_params` already contains exactly `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}` and kernel is `'poly'`, then `gamma` might still be None and not added because `kernel_params` dict is used directly.
   - But the code says: if `kernel_params` is None → start empty dict, then add from attributes.  
     If `kernel_params` is not None → use that dict and **skip** adding from attributes? Wait, no:  
     Looking at the code:  
     ```
     params = self.kernel_params
     if params is None:
         params = {}
     if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':
         for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:
             if getattr(self, param) is not None:
                 params[param] = getattr(self, param)
     ```
     So even if `self.kernel_params` is not None, it still goes into the loop and potentially **overwrites** or adds attributes from `self`.  
     So if `self.kernel_params` already has `coef0=0.1`, but `self.coef0` is `0.2`, then `self.coef0` would overwrite `params['coef0']` with `0.2`.  
     So for final `params['coef0']` to be `0.1`, either `self.coef0` is `0.1` and `kernel_params` is None (so `params['coef0']` gets 0.1 from `self.coef0`), or `kernel_params` already has `0.1` and `self.coef0` is None (so it's not added/overwritten).

7. The output is exactly `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`. So `gamma` key is missing, which means `self.gamma` must be None (otherwise it would be added if kernel supports it). So kernel supports `gamma` but `gamma` is None.

8. The kernel must be one that includes `'coef0'` and `'degree'` in `KERNEL_PARAMS`. That is `'poly'` or maybe `'sigmoid'`? Let's check sklearn source:  
   For `'poly'`: `('gamma', 'coef0', 'degree')`  
   For `'sigmoid'`: `('gamma', 'coef0')` → no `degree`, so can't output degree.  
   So kernel must be `'poly'`.

9. Also, `self.degree` must be `3.1`, `self.coef0` must be `0.1`, `self.gamma` None, `self.kernel_params` None, `kernel='poly'`.

10. Other attributes (`n_components`, `random_state`, `normalization_`, `components_`, `component_indices_`) are irrelevant for `_get_kernel_params`.

Thus the input:

```
{
    "self": {
        "kernel": "poly",
        "gamma": null,
        "coef0": 0.1,
        "degree": 3.1,
        "kernel_params": null,
        "n_components": 100,
        "random_state": null,
        "normalization_": null,
        "components_": null,
        "component_indices_": null
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

But wait: if `kernel_params` is None, the output would also include `gamma: null` if `gamma` is in `KERNEL_PARAMS['poly']` and `self.gamma` is None?  
No — the code only adds param to `params` if `getattr(self, param) is not None`. Since `self.gamma` is None, it won't add `gamma` to params. So output correctly lacks `gamma`.

Perfect.
