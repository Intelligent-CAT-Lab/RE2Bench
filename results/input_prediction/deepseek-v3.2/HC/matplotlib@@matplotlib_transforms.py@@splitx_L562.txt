[THOUGHT]
1. The output consists of three Bbox objects resulting from splitting an original Bbox along the x-axis.
2. From the output Bboxes, we can deduce the original Bbox's extents: x0=0.125, y0≈0.1, x1=0.9, y1=0.9. Specifically, y0 appears as 0.09999999999999998 in the output, so we take that exact value.
3. The width w = x1 - x0 = 0.775.
4. The three Bboxes correspond to intervals (0, a), (a, a), (a, 1) for some fraction a. From the first Bbox: x0 + a*w = 0.78375, so a = (0.78375 - 0.125)/0.775 = 0.65875/0.775 = 0.85.
5. Thus, the split fractions are a=0.85, and since there is a degenerate Bbox, we need two split points both equal to 0.85. Hence args = (0.85, 0.85).
6. The self object must have _points set to [[0.125, 0.09999999999999998], [0.9, 0.9]]. Other attributes are not used by splitx, so we set them to plausible defaults: _parents={}, _invalid=0, _shorthand_name="Bbox", _minpos=[0,0], _ignore=False, _points_orig same as _points.
