[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `[[0 2], [1 4], [2 6]]` which appears to be a 3x2 NumPy array. This suggests that the ColumnTransformer produced 2 features in the output.

2. Looking at the output structure, it seems like the transformers processed the input data and transformed it. The format suggests two columns were produced.

3. I need to create a scenario where the transformers would produce exactly this output. Let me think about what transformers could create this pattern:

   - The first column: [0, 1, 2] - this could be from an identity transformer on the first column of input
   - The second column: [2, 4, 6] - this could be from a transformer that multiplies by 2, possibly on the second column

4. Let me design a simple ColumnTransformer setup:
   - Transformer 1: 'identity' on column 0 (passthrough or identity transformer)
   - Transformer 2: A transformer that multiplies by 2 on column 1

5. For the input data, I need something that when processed gives [0, 1, 2] and [2, 4, 6]. A simple input would be:
   - Column 0: [0, 1, 2] 
   - Column 1: [1, 2, 3]

6. The transformers should be set up as:
   ```
   [('identity', 'passthrough', [0]), ('multiply_by_2', CustomTransformer(), [1])]
   ```
   Where CustomTransformer multiplies the input by 2.

7. For the remainder, I'll use 'drop' since we only want these two columns.

8. The other parameters can be set to defaults:
   - sparse_threshold: 0.3
   - n_jobs: None
   - transformer_weights: None
   - verbose: False

9. After fitting, the transformers_ attribute should contain the fitted transformers.

10. The input X should be a DataFrame or array with the values [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]].
