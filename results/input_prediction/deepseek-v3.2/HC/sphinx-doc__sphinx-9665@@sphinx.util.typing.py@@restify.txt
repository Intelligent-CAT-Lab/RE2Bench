[THOUGHT]  
The output is `:py:obj:`None``. Looking at the `restify` function, the first check is:  

```python
if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
    return ':py:obj:`None`'
```  

This means `cls` must either be `None` (the singleton) or `NoneType` (which is `type(None)`).  
The structure expects `args: {"cls": XXX}`. Since the output is exactly `:py:obj:`None``, the simplest input is `cls = None`.  
Alternatively, `cls = type(None)` would also work, but `None` is more direct.  
The `self` field is empty because `restify` is a regular function, not a method requiring an object instance.  

Thus, `XXX` = `None`.
