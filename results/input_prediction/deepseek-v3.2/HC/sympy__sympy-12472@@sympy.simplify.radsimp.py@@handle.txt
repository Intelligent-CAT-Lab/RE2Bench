Let me analyze the `handle` function step by step.

1. The output is `1/(a - b)`, which means the `handle` function returned this expression.

2. Looking at the `handle` function structure:
   - It takes an expression `expr` and processes it
   - It separates numerator (`n`) and denominator (`d`) using `fraction(expr)`
   - The main logic handles rationalization of denominators

3. The output `1/(a - b)` suggests that the input `expr` must have been something with `(a - b)` in the denominator after rationalization.

4. Common cases where `handle` would return `1/(a - b)`:
   - If the input was `1/(a - b)` directly (simple case)
   - If the input was something like `1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))` that gets rationalized to `1/(a - b)`
   - If the input was `(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))/(a - b)` that gets simplified

5. Let me trace what would happen with `1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))`:
   - `n = 1`, `d = sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)`
   - `d` is an Add expression with radicals
   - The function would recognize this as having 2 radical terms: `[(a, 1), (b, -1)]`
   - It would use the 2-term rationalization formula: `(sqrt(A)*a - sqrt(B)*b)` where A=a, a=1, B=b, b=1
   - This gives `(sqrt(a)*1 - sqrt(b)*1)` but wait, our denominator is `sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)`, so actually it matches
   - The rationalization factor would be `(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))`
   - Multiplying numerator and denominator: `(1*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))/((sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))` = `(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))/(a - b)`
   - But our output is just `1/(a - b)`, so this doesn't match

6. Let me try `(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))/(a - b)`:
   - `n = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)`, `d = a - b`
   - Since `d` is not a radical expression, `handle` might just return the input as-is
   - But the output shows only `1/(a - b)` in the denominator

7. Actually, let me think about what would give exactly `1/(a - b)`:
   - If the input was `1/(a - b)` directly, `handle` would return it unchanged since there are no radicals to rationalize
   - If the input was something like `1/(sqrt(a^2) - b)` and `sqrt(a^2)` simplifies to `a`, we'd get `1/(a - b)`

8. Looking at the function logic more carefully:
   - The function handles cases with square roots in the denominator
   - If there are no radicals, it should return the input mostly unchanged
   - The simplest case is that the input was exactly `1/(a - b)`

9. Let me test the simplest hypothesis: `expr = 1/(a - b)`
   - `n, d = fraction(expr)` gives `n = 1`, `d = a - b`
   - `d` is an Add expression but has no radicals
   - The function would go through the logic and eventually return `1/(a - b)`

This seems like the most straightforward case that would produce the given output.
