Looking at the function `match_submerged_margins`, it takes three parameters: `self`, `layoutgrids`, and `fig`. The output shows a list of two Axes objects. The function returns `axs`, which is a list of axes that meet certain conditions. In the output, we see two axes returned.

Examining the function logic:

1. It starts by collecting axes from subfigs recursively.
2. Then it gets axes from the main figure that have a subplotspec, are in layout, and are not already collected.
3. Then it compares axes that span multiple columns/rows to ensure interior margins match.

Given the output is just two axes, and the structure suggests layoutgrids includes a Figure and GridSpec, we need to infer what input would cause the function to return exactly two axes.

The key condition for an axis to be included in `axs` is:
- `a.get_subplotspec() is not None`
- `a.get_in_layout()` is True
- `a not in axsdone` (axes from subfigs are already processed)

So we need a figure with at least two axes that meet these conditions, and they should have subplotspecs from a gridspec that's in layoutgrids.

Looking at the structure, layoutgrids is a dict with keys: "hasgrids", "Figure(1000x500)", "GridSpec(1, 2)". So the figure size is 1000x500, and there's a GridSpec with 1 row, 2 columns. This suggests a figure with a gridspec of 1x2, meaning two subplots side by side.

Thus, the figure likely has two axes from a 1x2 gridspec. The function would then process these two axes and return them.

Therefore, the input `fig` should be a Figure object with two axes arranged in a 1x2 grid. The `layoutgrids` dict should contain the corresponding layout grids for the figure and gridspec.

I'll now construct the input accordingly.

        "layoutgrids": {
            "hasgrids": true,
            "Figure(1000x500)": "<layoutgrid for figure>",
            "GridSpec(1, 2)": "<layoutgrid for gridspec>"
        },
        "fig": "<Figure object with 2 axes in 1x2 GridSpec>"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
