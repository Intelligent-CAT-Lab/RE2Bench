[THOUGHT]
The output is a bytearray of length 512 (LUT_SIZE = 512 for 3x3 patterns) where all bytes are 0 except the last byte which is 1. This corresponds to lut[i] = 0 for i = 0 to 510, and lut[511] = 1. The default lut from `build_default_lut()` sets lut[i] = 1 if bit 4 (center pixel) is 1, which would give 256 ones and 256 zeros. To get almost all zeros, patterns must override most entries to 0. The pattern ":(.........)->0" matches any 9-bit pattern and sets it to 0. The pattern ":(111111111)->1" matches only the all-ones pattern (i=511) and sets it to 1. If these patterns are in order, the first sets all to 0, then the second overrides i=511 to 1, producing the observed output. The initial lut is None since `build_lut` creates a new lut. Thus, the input patterns are as above.
