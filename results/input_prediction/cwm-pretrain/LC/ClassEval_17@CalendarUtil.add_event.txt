- Let's analyze the behavior of the code.
- The method `add_event` simply appends the provided `event` to the `self.events` list, which is initially empty.
- Since the output is `null`, this suggests the `event` is being added without error.
- The structure contains placeholders for the event's date, start time, end time, and description.
- To satisfy the `null` output, all these fields must be valid and properly formatted.
- Let's assume a reasonable default event structure.
