1. Since the output is a random password, we need to simulate the `make_random_password` function call.
2. The function is deprecated and raises a warning, which doesn't affect the output.
3. The function uses `get_random_string` to generate a password of specified length (10 by default).
4. The `get_random_string` function uses the `allowed_chars` parameter to define the character set for the password.
5. The output is a random string of 10 characters from the allowed character set.
6. The allowed character set provided is 'abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'.
7. The output "PNFHWJjwvd" contains 10 characters from this character set.
8. The input is an instance of `BaseUserManager` which is passed as the `self` parameter.
9. The default length is 10 and default allowed characters are as provided, so we don't need to modify them.
10. The default character set and length match the output, so no custom parameters are needed.
11. The only parameter needed is the `self` instance of `BaseUserManager`.
