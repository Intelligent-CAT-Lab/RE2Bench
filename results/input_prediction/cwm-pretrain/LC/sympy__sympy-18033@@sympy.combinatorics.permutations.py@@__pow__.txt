The given output indicates that the `_array_form` is `null` and the `_size` is 7. This implies that the permutation does not have a predefined array form, and it operates on a set of size 7.

For the `__pow__` method, the input parameter `n` determines the power to which the permutation is raised. Since the `_array_form` is not provided, we must infer the input from the context of the function's output.

1. `_size = 7`: The size of the set on which the permutation operates.
2. `_array_form = null`: No specific permutation is defined, but since it's an empty structure, it can represent an identity permutation of size 7.

To raise a permutation to a power, we typically use the structure of the permutation. Since the `_array_form` is `null`, we assume that the permutation is the identity permutation on a set of size 7, and raising it to any power `n` will still result in the same identity permutation.

Therefore, we can set:
- `self._array_form = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (representing the identity permutation on a set of size 7).
- `self._size = 7` (the size of the set).
- `self._cyclic_form = []` (since it's an identity permutation and does not have any cycles).

The input `n` for raising the permutation to a power does not affect the output in this case, as the identity permutation raised to any power remains unchanged. However, for the sake of prediction, we can set `n = 1`, which is the neutral element for the power operation.

Thus, the predicted input is:

    "self": {
        "_array_form": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],

1. The given output corresponds to `__pow__`. The result, represented in _array_form, shows a permutation array. This array must have the same structure as _array_form of self before raising to a power.
2. The _size is set to 7, meaning the permutation acts on a set of size 7. The array size aligns with _size, but the specific mapping in _array_form determines the permutation's structure.
3. _array_form for self is not provided directly, but the result's _array_form reveals the mapping after raising to the power. For an identity permutation, raising to any power results in the same permutation.
4. The power `n` must be 1 or another value that does not change the permutation structure. Given the identity nature, `n = 1` is appropriate.
5. Assume _array_form is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], representing the identity permutation. When raised to any power, it remains unchanged.
6. Given _size is 7 and no further cycles or structure are inferred, we can safely assume a simple identity structure.

To predict the input for the `__pow__` function given the output:
```
{
    "_array_form": null,
    "_size": 7
}
```
1. The output indicates that the result of raising the permutation to a power is a permutation on a set of size 7. Since `_array_form` is `null`, it implies that the permutation is in its identity form or that the structure is not fully initialized.

2. The input to the function `__pow__` is a tuple `(self, n)`, where:
   - `self` is an instance of the `Permutation` class.
   - `n` is the power to which the permutation is raised.

3. Since the output corresponds to a permutation with `_size = 7`, we assume that the original permutation (`self`) operates on a set of size 7.

4. Given that `_array_form` is `null`, we infer that `self` is in its identity form, which is a permutation that maps each element to itself. This means that `self._array_form` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

5. The output suggests that raising the permutation to any power `n` results in the same identity permutation. Therefore, `n` can be set to 1, as raising an identity permutation to any power results in the same permutation.

The predicted input is thus:

    "self": {
        "_array_form": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],

        "_cyclic_form": []
    },
    "args": {
        "n": 1
    },
    "kwargs": {}
