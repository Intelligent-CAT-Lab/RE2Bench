First, we are given the output `2017634310362021` and need to reverse-engineer the inputs to the program that would produce this output. The program performs the following steps:

1. Splits the input string into two parts, `a` and `b`.
2. Trims the second character from `b`, effectively removing the middle character.
3. Converts `a` and `b` to integers.
4. Calculates `(a * b) // 100`.

Let's simulate the process in reverse:
- The final result is `2017634310362021`, which implies `(a * b) // 100 = 2017634310362021`.
- Therefore, `a * b = 201763431036202100`.
- We need to find two values, `a` and `b`, such that removing a character from `b` and converting both to integers yields this product. This suggests that `b` may be a large number in string form, and we may need to try reconstructing it by adding potential missing characters back.

From the output, we can infer that the result is very large, which implies that `a` and `b` must be relatively large as well. 

Let's try breaking down the product into potential factors that could match the structure of the problem:
- Since the result is a large number and the operation involves integer division by 100, both `a` and `b` are likely to be large integers.
- Given that the output is an integer, the inputs should be integers as well, and the string format should be valid for integer conversion.

Given that `(a * b) // 100 = 2017634310362021`, the product `a * b` must be `201763431036202100`. To find the original values of `a` and `b`, we need to guess the original string value of `b`, which would have one extra character in it.

Since removing a character from `b` gives us `b = int(b[0] + b[2:])`, we need to consider the possibility that the middle character of `b` was removed. The number `2017634310362021` is divisible by 100, so the original product would be `2017634310362021 * 100 = 201763431036202100`.

Given the large size of the number and the fact that removing a character from `b` affects the result significantly, we need to try to reconstruct `b` and `a` based on the output.

After testing, it seems that:
- `a = 2017634310362021` and `b = 100`, removing the middle character from `b` gives us `100`.
- So, the original input string was `2017634310362021 100`, where the second character of `b` was removed to get `100`.

Thus, the input string that would produce the given output is `2017634310362021 100`.
