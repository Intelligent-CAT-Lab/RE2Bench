Your task is to make multiple choice questions. Return a list of question tuples where each tuple has 5 elements: (question, question_type, context, list_of_options, answer). Only the answer should be correct. Here is an example:
[
    (
        "Why do plants need nitrogen?",
        "multiple_choice",
        "None",
        ["photosynthesis", "growth", "breathing"],
        "growth",
    ),
    (
        "In a game of football, why would a manager substitute a striker for a defender?",
        "multiple_choice",
        "None",
        [
            "Strikers are needed for defence",
            "Defenders are better at attacking",
            "The team is losing and needs more goals",
        ],
        "The team is losing and needs more goals",
    ),
]
