We start with the given Python code which is supposed to perform a computation based on two integers, t and h, which are read from the standard input. The goal is to determine what these two integers should be so that the function outputs 2.

1. The first step in the code is to take input as a string, split it by whitespace, and convert the two resulting substrings into integers. This is represented by `t, h = map(int, input().split())`.

2. Then, it performs a computation: `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`. This expression means subtract 2 from h, then perform integer division by t minus 1, and finally add 1 to the result.

3. The output is given as 2, meaning that the result of the expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1` equals 2.

From this, we can determine the value of h and t:
- `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2` implies `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`.

To find values of t and h that satisfy this, we consider that both t and h are positive integers and h > 2 and t > 1 to avoid division by zero and to ensure integer division behaves as expected.

The simplest solution is when h = 4 and t = 3:
- (4 - 2) // (3 - 1) = 2 // 2 = 1.

Therefore, the input for the function should be:

To solve this, let's break down the problem. The Python code takes two integers as input, t and h. It then performs a mathematical computation and prints the result. The output given is 2, which is the result of the computation.

The given function is:
1. Read two integers, t and h.
2. Perform the computation `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.
3. Output the result.

We need to reverse-engineer what the input should be to produce an output of 2.

Starting with the output 2, we know that:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`  
This simplifies to: `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`.

We can solve for h in terms of t:
1. `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`  
   Multiplying both sides by (t - 1) to eliminate the division:  
   `h - 2 = 1 * (t - 1)`  
   Simplifying gives:  
   `h = t + 1`

So, if h is 1 more than t, then the input could be any pair of positive integers (t, t+1) such that t > 1.

Choosing the simplest positive integers greater than 1 for t and h:
- `t = 2`  
- `h = 3`  

This pair satisfies our reverse-engineered requirement, where `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = (3 - 2) // (2 - 1) = 1 // 1 = 1`, and adding 1 to this result gives 2.

Thus, the input that would produce an output of 2 in the given Python code snippet is "2 3".

To determine the input of the code snippet, given the output is 2, we need to reverse-engineer the process of how the output 2 is produced by the Python code.

Given the code is:
```python
t, h = map(int, input().split())
print((h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1)
```
Here's the step-by-step logic:
1. The code takes input as two integers separated by a space.
2. It then performs the computation `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.

Given the output is 2, we set up the equation:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`

Solving for the variables t and h:
- Subtract 1 from both sides:  
  `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`
- Since `(h - 2) // (t - 1)` must equal an integer (because it's integer division), the smallest positive integers that satisfy this equation are:
  - `t = 2`, because `t - 1 = 1`
  - `h = 3`, because `h - 2 = 1`

So, with `t = 2` and `h = 3`, the input would be "2 3".

The Python code snippet performs a calculation involving two integers, t and h, read from the standard input. The output of the code, which is 2, is derived from the expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.

To reverse engineer the inputs t and h that produce the output 2, let's analyze the expression step by step:
1. We start with the given output: `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`
2. Subtract 1 from both sides: `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`

This means that `(h - 2)` must be evenly divisible by `(t - 1)` and the result of this division is 1. Given that both t and h are integers, the simplest solution is when `(h - 2)` and `(t - 1)` are also integers and the division is exact.

Considering the smallest positive integers for t and h that satisfy this condition:
- If `t = 3`, then `t - 1 = 2`
- If `h = 4`, then `h - 2 = 2`

This satisfies our condition because `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 2 // 2 = 1`, and adding 1 to this result gives us the output 2.

Therefore, the input to the code snippet should be "3 4".

The Python code reads two integers, t and h, and performs a computation to produce an output of 2. To reverse-engineer the input, let's examine the given output and work backwards through the code.

The given output is 2. This is the result of the expression:
```python
(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1
```

Setting the output to 2, we have:
```python
(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2
```

Subtract 1 from both sides:
```python
(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1
```

This means that `(h - 2)` must be divisible by `(t - 1)` and the quotient must be 1. Given that we're working with integers, the simplest solution is to make `(t - 1) = 1`, which implies `t = 2`.

If `t = 2`, then:
```python
(h - 2) = 1
```

Therefore, `h = 3`.

So, the input to the code snippet to produce the output 2 would be `t = 2` and `h = 3`.

The code snippet is very simple. It reads two integers, t and h, and then calculates an output based on these two inputs. The output is given as 2. We need to find the input values (t and h) that would produce this output.

The expression used to calculate the output is:
(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1

We know the output is 2, so we can write the equation as:
(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2

Simplifying this equation:
(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1

Since both h and t are integers, and we are dealing with integer division, we need to find the smallest positive integers for h and t that satisfy this equation.

A pair of integers that satisfies this equation is t = 3 and h = 4:
(4 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2

This implies that `(h - 2)` is evenly divisible by `(t - 1)` and the result of the division is 1.

The simplest solution is to choose the smallest positive integers for t and h that satisfy this condition. If we choose `t = 3` and `h = 4`:
- `(t - 1) = 3 - 1 = 2`
- `(h - 2) = 4 - 2 = 2`

This satisfies the condition because `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 2 // 2 = 1`. Adding 1 to the result gives the output 2.

Therefore, the input to the code to produce the output 2 would be "3 4".
