First, I need to work backward from the output. I see that `center(marker)` is being called on each line of the input text and that `'\n'` is joining the lines. This implies that the input text consists of multiple lines, and each line is being centered based on the value of `marker`.

From the output `#[]e>\n 8`, I can infer that the input text has two lines, where the first line is centered around the `#[]e>` pattern and the second line is centered around the `8` pattern. This suggests that the input text contains lines with these substrings.

Next, I need to reconstruct the input text and determine the value of `marker`. I will simulate the function step-by-step, reasoning through the execution to arrive at the correct input values.

Starting with the input structure:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "txt": XXX,
        "marker": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

I will simulate the function `f(txt, marker)` as follows:
1. Split the input text `txt` into lines using `split('\n')`.
2. For each line, apply the `center(marker)` method.
3. Join the centered lines back together with `'\n'`.

By working backward from the output, I will reconstruct the input text `txt` and the value of `marker` to ensure that the function produces the given output.
