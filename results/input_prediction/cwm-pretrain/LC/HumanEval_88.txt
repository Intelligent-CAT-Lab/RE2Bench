From the output, we know that the sorted array contains a single element, 5. This implies that the original array had a length of at least 1. The reverse parameter in the sorted function depends on whether the sum of the first and last element of the array is even or odd. In this case, the array only contains one element, so the sum is 5 + 5 = 10, which is even. Therefore, the sorted function will sort the array in reverse order, which will not affect the array because it only contains one element.
