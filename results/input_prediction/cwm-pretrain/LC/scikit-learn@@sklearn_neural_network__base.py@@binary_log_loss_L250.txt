1. The `binary_log_loss` function computes a binary logarithmic loss, which is a standard loss function in binary classification tasks.
2. The loss is calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-p_i)]
   \]
   where `y_i` is the true label and `p_i` is the predicted probability.
3. The output of `3.4222022694919696` suggests a small positive loss, typical in cases where predictions are not perfect but not completely wrong either.
4. For such an output, we likely have a situation where the `y_prob` is slightly away from `y_true`.
5. Given the structure, we need to provide `y_true`, `y_prob`, and possibly `sample_weight`.
6. To produce a simple example, let's assume `y_true` and `y_prob` are both single values. 
   - For simplicity, let's consider `y_true = 0` and `y_prob = 0.9` (close to 1, but not perfect).
   - With these values, the loss calculation would look like:
     \[
     L = -(0 \log(0.9) + (1-0) \log(1-0.9)) = -(\log(0.1)) \approx -(-2.3026) = 2.3026
     \]
     This doesn't match, so let's adjust.
7. Considering the output is less than 2, let's adjust the values slightly. 
   - For `y_true = 0` and `y_prob = 0.98`, the loss would be:
     \[
     L = -(\log(0.98) + \log(1-0.98)) \approx -(-0.0202 + -1.9957) = 2.016
     \]
     Still too large.
8. Let's aim for a scenario where `y_prob` is closer to `y_true`. For `y_true = 0` and `y_prob = 0.99`:
   \[
   L = -(\log(0.99) + \log(1-0.99)) \approx -(-0.0101 + -4.6052) = 4.6153
   \]
   Too large.
9. For a loss around `3.422`, let's try `y_true = 0` and `y_prob = 0.95`:
   \[
   L = -(\log(0.95) + \log(1-0.95)) \approx -(-0.0513 + -2.9957) = 3.047
   \]
   This is closer but still not exact.
10. Refining further, let's test with `y_prob = 0.96`:
    \[
    L = -(\log(0.96) + \log(1-0.96)) \approx -(-0.0408 + -3.2189) = 3.2597
    \]
    Still off.
11. Finally, let's try `y_prob = 0.97`:
    \[
    L = -(\log(0.97) + \log(1-0.97)) \approx -(-0.0305 + -3.5145) = 3.5450
    \]
    This is very close to the desired output.
12. I will use `y_true = 0`, `y_prob = 0.97`, and no `sample_weight` to match the output.
