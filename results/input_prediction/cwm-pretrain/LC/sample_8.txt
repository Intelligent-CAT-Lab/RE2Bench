From the output "UppEr", we can infer that the input string was "upper" and the encryption was 1. This is because the function `f` applies a ROT13 transformation when encryption is set to 1. The ROT13 cipher rotates each letter by 13 places in the alphabet, which is a symmetric substitution cipher. Therefore, applying ROT13 twice returns the original text.

Given that "UppEr" is the result after applying ROT13 to "upper", we can reconstruct the input as follows:
- string = "upper"
- encryption = 1

This would produce the output "UppEr" because "upper" in ROT13 becomes "UppEr".
