### Step 1: Understand the structure of the `multiply` method
The `multiply` method in the `ComplexCalculator` class takes two arguments, `c1` and `c2`, both of which are complex numbers. The method multiplies these two complex numbers and returns the result.

### Step 2: Parse the output to understand the expected result
The output provided is `(-5+10j)`, which is a complex number in Python notation. This tells us that the result of multiplying `c1` and `c2` should be a complex number with a real part of -5 and an imaginary part of 10.

### Step 3: Determine the structure of the input
Given the structure of the input:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "c1": XXX,
        "c2": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
We need to fill in the placeholders `XXX` for `c1` and `c2` with complex numbers such that their product matches the given output.

### Step 4: Consider possible combinations of `c1` and `c2`
To get a real part of -5 and an imaginary part of 10, we need to find two complex numbers whose product gives this result. The general formula for multiplying complex numbers is:
```
(a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
```
where:
- `a` and `b` are the real and imaginary parts of `c1`,
- `c` and `d` are the real and imaginary parts of `c2`.

We are looking for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that:
- `ac - bd = -5`
- `ad + bc = 10`

### Step 5: Solve for possible values of `c1` and `c2`
One way to find a pair of `c1` and `c2` that satisfies the conditions is to choose values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that the equations are satisfied. However, without additional constraints or further information, there are many possible solutions.

For simplicity, we can choose simple values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Let's set:
- `a = 2`
- `b = 3`
- `c = -3`
- `d = 1`

Plugging these values into the equations:
- `2 * -3 - 3 * 1 = -6 - 3 = -9` (which does not match -5)
- `2 * 1 + 3 * -3 = 2 - 9 = -7` (which does not match 10)

These values do not satisfy the conditions, so we need to adjust them. Let's try another combination:
- `a = 1`
- `b = 2`
- `c = -3`
- `d = 1`

Plugging these values into the equations:
- `1 * -3 - 2 * 1 = -3 - 2 = -5` (which matches -5)
- `1 * 1 + 2 * -3 = 1 - 6 = -5` (which does not match 10)

These values do not satisfy the conditions, so we need to adjust them again. Let's try another combination:
