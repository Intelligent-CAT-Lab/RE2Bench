Let's start by understanding what the function `f` does. It takes a list `nums` and two indices `pop1` and `pop2`, then removes the elements at those indices (after adjusting for 1-based indexing by subtracting 1) and returns the modified list. The output provided is `[1, 2, 3]`, so we need to determine the input `nums` and the indices `pop1` and `pop2` that would result in this output.

The function `f` first removes the element at index `pop1 - 1`, and then removes the element at index `pop2 - 1`. Since the final list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the removals must have occurred at positions that do not affect the order of the remaining elements.

Let's consider possible removals:
- If `pop1` and `pop2` are close together, one of the elements might be removed before the other, affecting the indices.
- Since the result is sorted, it suggests that the removed elements were either at the beginning or end of the list, or the indices were such that the removals did not disrupt the order.

Given the output `[1, 2, 3]`, one possibility is that the original list was longer, and `pop1` and `pop2` targeted elements that, when removed, left the list in this order. Another possibility is that the list was shorter and elements were removed to produce this list.

For simplicity, let's try a few scenarios:
1. If `nums` was originally `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and `pop1 = 1` and `pop2 = 3`, the function would first remove `0` and then `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. If `nums` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `pop1 = 4` and `pop2 = 5`, the function would first remove `4` and then `5`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.

There are multiple possible inputs that could produce the output `[1, 2, 3]`. Since the problem does not specify the exact input, we will choose one of the simplest and most straightforward inputs that could produce this output.

Let's assume the original list was `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the indices were `pop1 = 1` and `pop2 = 3`. This would result in the removal of `0` and `2`, leaving `[1, 2, 3]`.

Given the structure of the function `f`, which removes elements at specific indices from a list `nums`, the provided output `[1, 2, 3]` indicates that the original list had these elements in order and possibly additional elements that were removed. 

To achieve this output, the initial list could be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. By setting `pop1 = 1` and `pop2 = 5` (using 1-based indexing), the first and last elements would be removed, leaving `[1, 2, 3]`. This combination of input and parameters would result in the desired output.
<think>
Let's trace the function `f` step by step with the input `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and parameters `pop1 = 1`, `pop2 = 5`.

1. `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)`:
   - `pop1 - 1` is `0`, so the element at index `0` is removed. The list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)`:
   - `pop2 - 1` is `4`, so the element at index `4` is removed. The list becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the output `[1, 2, 3]` matches the provided output.
