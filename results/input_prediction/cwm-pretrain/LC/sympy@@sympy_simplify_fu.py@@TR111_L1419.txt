I need to analyze how the function `TR111` is transforming its input to produce the output `"cos(phi)**2"`. The function is transforming the input expression using `bottom_up` traversal, and seems to be rewriting trigonometric expressions in reciprocal form (using cot, csc, sec instead of tan, sin, cos) raised to a negative power.

Let me determine what the input to `TR111` must have been to produce the output `"cos(phi)**2"`:

1. The output suggests that the input expression was not directly `"cos(phi)**2"`, but instead it was transformed into this form.
2. Looking at the transformation function `f`:
   - If the base is `cos`, it replaces it with `sec` raised to the negative of the power
   - So for input `"cos(phi)**2"` to remain unchanged, it must not match the condition for transformation

Given this, the only way the transformation wouldn't apply is if the input already is `"cos(phi)**2"` and the base isn't a `tan`, `sin`, or `cos` instance that would trigger the transformation.

Therefore, the most likely input that would produce `"cos(phi)**2"` as output is simply `"cos(phi)**2"` itself, since no transformation would be applied in this case.
