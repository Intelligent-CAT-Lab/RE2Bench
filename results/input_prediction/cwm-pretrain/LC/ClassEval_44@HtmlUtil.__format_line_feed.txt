The `__format_line_feed` function replaces one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline character.

The output is "Some sentence here.", which means the input does not contain any consecutive newline characters.

Therefore, the input is the same as the output.

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "text": "Some sentence here."
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
