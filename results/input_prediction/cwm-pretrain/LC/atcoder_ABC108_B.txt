Given the output of "101 99 101 100", we know the calculations inside the print statement have been executed. We can reverse engineer the input by figuring out the values that would produce such an output when plugged into the equations.

The equations are:
x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a

Since we know the output values, we can infer the input values. Let's denote:
- x2 - b = 101
- y2 + a = 99
- x1 - b = 101
- y1 + a = 100

Given the symmetry and the nature of these equations, it suggests that there are specific values for x1, y1, x2, y2, a, and b that would result in such output.

Looking at the symmetry of the output, we can deduce that x2 = x1 and y2 = y1 + a. This would imply that the difference between y1 and y2 is 'a', which when added to y1 gives us y2, and when added to y1 gives us 100.

Considering that y1 + a = 100, and we know one of the y values is 100, it's plausible that y1 could be 99, making 'a' equal to 1.

With y1 being 99 and a being 1, we can confirm that y2 is indeed 100.

Since x1 - b = 101 and x2 - b = 101, it implies that x1 and x2 have the same value, and that value minus 'b' is 101. If 'b' is 0, then x1 and x2 would both be 101.

Finally, putting these deduced values into the equation for the output:
- x2 - b = 101 - 0 = 101
- y2 + a = 100 + 1 = 101 (Corrected to match the intended output value)
- x1 - b = 101 - 0 = 101
- y1 + a = 99 + 1 = 100

Given that there seems to be a miscalculation in the step-by-step reasoning above, particularly with the value for y2 + a resulting in 101 instead of the expected 99, we should adjust our interpretation. The initial analysis incorrectly concluded that y2 = 100. Instead, given that y1 + a = 100, and knowing that one of the output values is 99 for y2 + a, we should consider that y2 could be y1 minus a, which would align with the given output values more appropriately.

Let's correct the analysis:
- If y1 + a = 100, and y2 + a = 99, then y2 must be y1 - a.
- Given that y1 + a = 100, if we consider y1 = 99, then a = 1.
- If y2 = y1 - a, then y2 = 99 - 1 = 98.
- This results in y2 + a = 98 + 1 = 99, which matches one of the output values.

However, the corrected values for y1 and y2 would be y1 = 99 and y2 = 98, and for the x values to be 101, if x1 and x2 are 101, and given the equation x2 - b = 101, it suggests that 'b' must be 0.

So, with the corrected understanding, the input values are:
x1 = 101, y1 = 99, x2 = 101, y2 = 98

These values when input into the code would produce the output "101 99 101 100", aligning with the expected result.

Therefore, the input that would produce the given output is x1 = 101, y1 = 99, x2 = 101, y2 = 98.
