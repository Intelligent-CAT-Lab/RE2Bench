You are given a Python function `car_race_collision` which takes an integer `n` and returns `n ** 2`. The provided output is `9`, which means that the function was called with an input `n` such that `n ** 2 = 9`. This implies that `n = 3` because `3 ** 2 = 9`.

The input to the function should be structured as follows:
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 3
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

<|input|>
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 3
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
