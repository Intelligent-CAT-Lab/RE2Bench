To determine the input of the `generate_email_pattern` function, we need to analyze the output and understand how the function generates the email pattern.

Given the output: "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"

This output is a regular expression pattern that matches email addresses. The function `generate_email_pattern` is defined in the `RegexUtils` class and returns this pattern.

The input to the `generate_email_pattern` function is an empty dictionary, as indicated by the [STRUCTURE] provided. Therefore, the input should be:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
