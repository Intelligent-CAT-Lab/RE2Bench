To predict the input of the given Python code snippet, we can analyze the steps involved in the code and the provided output.

The code snippet consists of a single line: `print(input().replace(',', ' '))`. This line reads an input string, replaces any commas in the string with spaces, and then prints the modified string.

Given the provided output: `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`, we can infer that the input string contains commas that were replaced with spaces.

Let's analyze the output:
- The output has three words separated by spaces: "avrnc", "fwujpcm", and "ggjmc".
- There are two spaces between the words, suggesting that the original input string had two commas.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the input string likely looks like `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`. The code replaced the commas with spaces, resulting in the output.

Therefore, the predicted input is `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`.
