Let's think through the provided code step by step:

1. The program reads a string of space-separated numbers from input and converts them to a tuple of integers. This tuple is stored in the variable ABC.
2. The program then checks if the value 5 appears exactly twice in the ABC tuple. If this condition is true, the program proceeds to calculate the sum of the ABC tuple. If the sum equals 17, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
3. If the value 5 does not appear exactly twice in the ABC tuple, the program simply prints "NO".

Given that the output is "YES", we know that:
- The sum of the numbers in the ABC tuple must be 17.
- The value 5 must appear exactly twice in the ABC tuple.

To fulfill these conditions, the numbers in the tuple must be: (5, 5, 7). This is because 5 + 5 + 7 = 17 and there are exactly two 5's.

Therefore, the input that would produce the output "YES" is: 5 5 7.

{
    "input": 5 5 7
