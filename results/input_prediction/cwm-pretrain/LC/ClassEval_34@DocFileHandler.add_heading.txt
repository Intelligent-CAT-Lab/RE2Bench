Given the output of `add_heading` as true, it indicates that the heading was successfully added to the document. The function is designed to take a heading and a level as parameters, and it attempts to add the heading to the document at the specified file path. Since the output is true, we can deduce that the function completed successfully. This implies that the file path is valid and the document was opened and modified as expected. The level is not specified in the output, so it is likely that the default level is used (level=1).
