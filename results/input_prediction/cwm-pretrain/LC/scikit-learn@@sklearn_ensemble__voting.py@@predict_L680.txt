1. The `VotingRegressor` instance is fitted (`check_is_fitted` doesn't raise an error) and ready to make predictions. This implies that `self.estimators_` is defined and populated with fitted models.
2. The output array has a shape of (400,), which means 400 samples are processed in a single batch.
3. The input `X` is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with shape (400, n_features). `n_features` is not explicitly known from the output alone.
4. The `VotingRegressor` averages predictions from its estimators. Given that the output has continuous float values, the underlying estimators must all be regressors or be numeric.
5. For a VotingRegressor, we can determine the estimator type and number from the length of the output array and weights. Since we have 400 outputs, we likely have 400 regressors or a base structure for each sample's feature vector.
6. The `named_estimators_` dictionary should map to the fitted models in `estimators_`. Based on the structure, we have 2 named estimators: `pipe1` and `pipe2`.
7. `weights` is `None`, so each estimator's prediction contributes equally to the average in `predict`.
8. The input `X` must be a 2D array with shape (400, n_features), where `n_features` corresponds to the input features of the underlying estimators. Given the complexity of the output values, we infer that `n_features` is likely high.

## Ideation
### Idea 1
  #### The idea of extending the functionality of the big dish dartboard. 
  #### Making the board more complex, introducing new dart board designs, changing objectives. 
  #### Basing the game on different themes: sports, nature, geography etc. 
  #### This idea was dropped due to the complexity of the application itself and the cost of the vision module. 
  
  - Example of a classic dartboard

### Idea 2
  #### Analysis of FIFA and Overwatch game with use of machine learning. 
  #### This idea was dropped due to the limited resources for running machine learning algorithms

### Idea 3
  #### The idea of creating a simple game in which the user can change the hair of a model in the GUI. 
  #### This idea was chosen due to the simplicity of the application and the ability to demonstrate the use of Python and GUI libraries.
