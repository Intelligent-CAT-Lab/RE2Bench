To determine the input for `morsel_to_cookie`, we must consider the structure of the `morsel` dictionary and how it is processed in the function. Given that the output is `null`, we can infer that the function does not return a value, which aligns with it raising an exception or not providing a return due to conditions within the function.

1. **Examining the Function**: The function attempts to calculate the `expires` time based on `max-age` or `expires` in the morsel. If `max-age` is provided, it tries to convert it to an integer and calculate the expiration time. If this fails, it raises a `TypeError`. If `expires` is provided, it parses the string to a timestamp.

2. **Inferring the Input**: Since the output is `null`, it suggests that the function did not successfully return a cookie, which could mean that an exception was raised. Given the structure of the `morsel` in the input and the need for it to raise an error to not return a value, the most plausible scenario is that `morsel['max-age']` is not an integer, causing a `ValueError` when attempting to convert it to an integer.

3. **Predicting the Input**: Based on the above reasoning, the input should be such that `morsel['max-age']` is not an integer, which would lead to a `TypeError` being raised. The rest of the parameters can be set to default or placeholder values as they are not relevant to the function's failure to return a cookie.
