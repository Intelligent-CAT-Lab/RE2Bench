I'll analyze the ComplexCalculator class and deduce the inputs needed to produce the output "(2-2j)" when calling the subtract method.

The subtract method takes two complex numbers c1 and c2, and subtracts c2 from c1. The result is a new complex number with real part c1.real - c2.real and imaginary part c1.imag - c2.imag.

Given the output "(2-2j)", this means:
- The real part of the result is 2
- The imaginary part of the result is -2

Let's work backwards from the subtraction operation:
- Real part: c1.real - c2.real = 2
- Imaginary part: c1.imag - c2.imag = -2

To make these equations work, we need:
- A larger real part in c1 than in c2
- A larger imaginary part in c2 than in c1 (or negative imaginary values)

The simplest working solution is:
c1 = 4 - 4j  (real part 4, imaginary part -4)
c2 = 2 - 2j  (real part 2, imaginary part -2)

When we subtract these:
(4 - 4j) - (2 - 2j) = (4-2) + (-4+2)j = 2 - 2j

This matches our desired output.

Now I'll format the input as requested:
<|user|>
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "c1": "(4-4j)",
        "c2": "(2-2j)"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
