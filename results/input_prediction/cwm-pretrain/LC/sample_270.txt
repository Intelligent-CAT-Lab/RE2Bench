### Answer

<think>
From `d = {}` we can know that the dictionary 'd' is initialized as an empty dictionary.
From `for key in dic:` we can know that 'dic' must have been an empty dictionary because there are no keys to iterate over.
From `return d` we can know that the function returns an empty dictionary.
