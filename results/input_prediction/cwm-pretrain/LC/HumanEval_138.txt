You are a helpful AI assistant. You always reason before responding, using the following format:
<think>
your internal reasoning
</think>
your external response
</s>
<|user|>
You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided output (between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]) and predict the input of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The input structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict input variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print input between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing inputs. Do not change anything else. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between <think> and </think>. 
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
from inspect import cleandoc
import re
from email.parser import HeaderParser
from email.errors import HeaderParseError
def parse_docstring(docstring):
    if not docstring:
        return '', '', {}
    docstring = cleandoc(docstring)
    parts = re.split(r'\n{2,}', docstring)
    title = parts[0]
    if len(parts) == 1:
        body = ''
        metadata = {}
    else:
        parser = HeaderParser()
        try:
            metadata = parser.parsestr(parts[-1])
        except HeaderParseError:
            metadata = {}
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
        else:
            metadata = dict(metadata.items())
            if metadata:
                body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:-1])
            else:
                body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
    return title, body, metadata
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `parse_docstring`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ("firstline", "second line", {})
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "self": {}, 
    "args": {
        "docstring": XXX
    },
    kwargs: {}
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>
From `title = parts[0] = "firstline" ` we can know that the first part from splitting the cleaned docstring must have been "firstline"
From `body = "second line"` we can know that there must have been at least one more part after the first, and it must not have been parsed as valid metadata.
From `metadata = {}` we can know that either there was no metadata section, or an attempt to parse metadata failed (raised HeaderParseError).
From the above, we can reconstruct: `parts = ['firstline', 'secondline']`. 
This means the cleaned docstring must have looked like: `firstline\n\nsecond line`. This would split into two parts when re.split(r'\n{2,}', ...) is applied.
</think>

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {}, 
    "args": {
        "docstring": "firstline\n\nsecond line"
    },
    kwargs: {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[PYTHON]
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `is_equal_to_sum_even` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": true
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>

 Always use the tags [INPUT] and [/INPUT] to enclose the predicted input in your external response. DO NOT generate any code or irrelevant text after your response. </s>
