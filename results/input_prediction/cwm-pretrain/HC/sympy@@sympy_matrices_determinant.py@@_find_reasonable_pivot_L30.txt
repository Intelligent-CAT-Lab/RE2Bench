To predict the input of `_find_reasonable_pivot` that would produce the given output, we can reverse-engineer the execution of the function step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Output
The given output is:
```
{
    "output": [
        0,
        "-9",
        false,
        []
    ]
}
```
This corresponds to the following return values from `_find_reasonable_pivot`:
- `index = 0`: The index of the pivot element.
- `col[index] = -9`: The value of the pivot element.
- `False`: Indicates whether the pivot was found after some additional simplification steps.
- `[]`: A list of newly determined zero values in the column.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Function
The function `_find_reasonable_pivot` attempts to find a reasonable pivot element from a column of expressions. It follows these steps:
1. **Check if all elements are numbers**: If all elements are numbers and at least one is a float, it uses a numerical approach to select the pivot.
2. **Find the first non-zero element**: If an element is non-zero and `iszerofunc` returns `False`, that element is chosen as the pivot.
3. **Apply simplification**: If none of the elements are deterministically non-zero, it applies a simplification function (`simpfunc`) to each element and tries again.

### Step 3: Predicting the Input
Given that the output indicates a pivot at index 0 with value `-9`, we can deduce the following:
- The column `col` must contain an element that evaluates to `-9` at index 0.
- The `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc` must be set in such a way that the numerical approach is taken, and the pivot is chosen based on the absolute values of the column elements.

#### Possible Input
To get the numerical approach, the column should contain at least one float. A simple input that fits this is:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "col": [-9.0, 2, 0],
        "iszerofunc": "_iszero",
        "simpfunc": "_simplify"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
Here:
- `col` is a list where the first element is a float (`-9.0`), triggering the numerical approach.
- `iszerofunc` is set to `"_iszero"`, which will return `True` for zero elements.
- `simpfunc` is set to `"_simplify"`, which can be used for simplification if needed.

### Final Input
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "col": [-9.0, 2, 0],
        "iszerofunc": "_iszero",
        "simpfunc": "_simplify"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
