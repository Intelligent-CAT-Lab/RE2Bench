To determine the input of `build_class`, given the output `<class '__main__.A'>`, we need to infer the parameters `self`, `args`, and `kwargs` that are passed to the function. Since no arguments are passed in `args` or `kwargs`, we focus on the `self` parameter, which is an instance of `_ClassBuilder` and contains attributes like `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output `<class '__main__.A'>` indicates that the function `build_class` returns a class named `A` located in the `__main__` module. This implies that the `_ClassBuilder` instance used to build the class has processed all necessary attributes and methods.

2. **Function Behavior**: The `build_class` method is responsible for evaluating snippets, creating or patching the class, and handling any necessary transformations or initializations before returning the constructed class.

3. **Parameter Inference**:
   - `self.auto_attribs`: This determines whether automatic attribute generation should occur. Since the output is a class without additional attributes, it is likely `False`.
   - `self.these`: This would typically refer to a list or tuple of attributes to be included in the class. Without additional attributes, this could be an empty list `[]`.
   - `self.has_custom_setattr`: This flag indicates whether the class has a custom `__setattr__` method. Given no special behavior is implied in the output, this is likely `False`.

### Predicted Input:
```
[INPUT]
{
    "self": {
        "auto_attribs": false,
        "these": [],
        "has_custom_setattr": false
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
