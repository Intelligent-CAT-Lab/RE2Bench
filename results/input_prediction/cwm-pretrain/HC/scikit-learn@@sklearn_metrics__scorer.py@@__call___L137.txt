To predict the input of the `__call__` method, given the output `{"score": -Infinity}`, we need to simulate the execution step-by-step and consider the internal workings of the `_MultimetricScorer` class and related functions.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Output Interpretation**:
   - The score is `-Infinity`, which typically indicates that an operation resulted in a negative infinity. In the context of scoring, this could happen if, for example, a denominator was zero in a division operation or a logarithm of zero was taken.

2. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The `_score` method of the `_BaseScorer` class is responsible for computing the score. It applies a function (`_score_func`) to predictions (`y_pred`) and true values (`y_true`).

3. **Significance of `_use_cache`**:
   - `_use_cache` is false because there is only one scorer, which means no caching is used.

4. **Routing and Metadata**:
   - `process_routing` is used to handle metadata. If there is no routing enabled or no metadata provided, it returns an `EmptyRequest` object.

5. **Key Points**:
   - The `score` function in the `estimator` (passed as an argument) is called and returns `-Infinity`.
   - This suggests that the `estimator`'s `score` method might be computing a score involving a logarithm of zero (e.g., in information-theoretic scores like log loss) or a division by zero.

### Predicted Input:

Given the structure and the behavior of the `_MultimetricScorer`, and assuming that the `estimator` is an object with a `score` method that returns `-Infinity`, the predicted input would look like this:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "_scorers": {
            "score": {
                "_score_func": function(y_true, y_pred, **kwargs) -> -Infinity
            }
        },
        "_raise_exc": true
    },
    "args": {
        "estimator": {
            "score": function(*args, **kwargs) -> -Infinity
        },
        "args": ["arg1", "arg2"]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

### Explanation:
- The `score` function inside `_scorers` returns `-Infinity`, indicating an issue with the scoring logic (e.g., division by zero or log(0)).
- `_raise_exc` is set to `true` to ensure exceptions are raised if any scoring issues occur.
- The `estimator`'s `score` method also returns `-Infinity`, which aligns with the output.
- The structure follows the provided format, with placeholders `XXX` replaced by the inferred values.
