The output provided suggests that the `_compute_n_features_outs` method is returning a list with a single element, `[2]`. This implies that the `categories_` attribute in the `self` object is a list containing a single element, which is likely a list or array of length 2.

To deduce the input values for `self` and method arguments, let's analyze the structure and components:

1. **categories_**: Since the output is `[2]`, the `categories_` attribute should be a list where the first (and in this case, only) item is an iterable of length 2.
2. **_drop_idx_after_grouping and _infrequent_indices**: Both affect the output length. If there is no drop or infrequent index handling, they are either `None` or do not affect the result in a way that would reduce the output from 2.

Here is the predicted input structure:

```
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "categories": "auto",
        "sparse_output": true,
        "dtype": "np.float64",
        "handle_unknown": "error",
        "drop": null,
        "min_frequency": null,
        "max_categories": null,
        "feature_name_combiner": "concat",
        "_infrequent_enabled": false,
        "n_features_in_": 1,
        "categories_": [[1, 2]],  # This should be a list where the first element is an iterable of length 2
        "_drop_idx_after_grouping": null,
        "drop_idx_": null
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

This configuration assumes that `categories_` contains a single list with two elements, which explains the output `[2]`. The other attributes (`drop_idx_`, `_drop_idx_after_grouping`, `_infrequent_indices`, etc.) are set to values that would not reduce the output length from 2.
