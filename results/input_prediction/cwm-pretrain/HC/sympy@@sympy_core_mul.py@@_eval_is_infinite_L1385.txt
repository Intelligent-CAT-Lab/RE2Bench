1. The output of `_eval_is_infinite` is `False`.
2. `_eval_is_infinite` uses the helper function `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` to determine if the object represents zero or infinity.
3. The helper function `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` returns a tuple of two elements: `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite`.
4. Since the result is `False`, the helper function must have returned `(False, False)` or `(True, True)` as these are the only cases where `_eval_is_infinite` would return `False`.
5. Therefore, `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` are both either `True` or `False` after iterating through the arguments.
6. The arguments are the individual terms in the multiplication.
7. Since the result is `False`, none of the arguments can be infinite, and at least one argument must be non-zero.
8. The structure of the input is just `self`, which represents the multiplication expression.
9. Therefore, the input must be a `Mul` object where none of the arguments are infinite and at least one argument is not zero.
10. We need to construct a `Mul` object that satisfies these conditions.
11. The simplest such object is `Mul(1)` which has no infinite terms and has a non-zero term.
12. Therefore, the input to `_eval_is_infinite` is a `Mul` object representing the product of just the number `1`.

1. I need to generate an input for the _eval_is_zero method of the Mul class which returns None.
2. The method uses the helper function _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper which returns (seen_zero, seen_infinite).
3. The result of _eval_is_zero is based on this tuple:
   - If seen_zero is True and seen_infinite is False, return False.
   - If seen_zero is False and seen_infinite is False, return False.
   - Otherwise, return None.
4. To make _eval_is_zero return None, we need either seen_zero or seen_infinite (or both) to be True, and also at least one of them to be None.
5. This means we need at least one zero element and one infinite element in the Mul object.
6. But the infinite element's sign must be unknown, or the zero element's sign must be unknown.
7. Therefore, the input will be a Mul object with a zero element and an infinite element where the sign of at least one of them is unknown.
8. I'll construct a Mul object with Symbol('x') (which is neither zero nor infinite) and 1/x (which is infinite when x is non-zero).

1. The method _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper is used by both _eval_is_zero and _eval_is_infinite to determine if an object represents zero or infinity.
2. It returns a tuple (seen_zero, seen_infinite) indicating whether any of the arguments are zero or infinite.
3. For the return value (True, False), seen_zero must be True and seen_infinite must be False.
4. This means we need a Mul object where at least one argument is zero, but none are infinite.
5. The simplest such case is a Mul object containing just the value 0.
