The function `_symbolic_factor_list` takes an expression and returns a list of factors. Given the output, the expression to factor is `cos(phi)`. The output format consists of a coefficient (here `1`) and a list of factors. The single factor here is `Poly(cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` with an exponent of `1`.

To reproduce this result:
1. `expr` should be set to `cos(phi)`.
2. `opt.fraction` should be set to a value that allows the function to process and return the factorization in the expected format.
3. `method` should be set to a value compatible with the factorization process; given the output structure, it might not directly influence the result here but should remain a valid method parameter.

The key is ensuring that `expr` is `cos(phi)`, and the configuration in `opt` allows the function to return the factor as shown.
