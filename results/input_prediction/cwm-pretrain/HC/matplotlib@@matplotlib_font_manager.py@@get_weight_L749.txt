Let's break this down step by step.

1. The function get_weight is called with a specific instance of FontProperties.
2. The return value of get_weight is "normal".

Looking at the FontProperties class:
- The get_weight method simply returns the _weight attribute.
- The _weight attribute is set in the set_weight method.

In the set_weight method, there are two main possibilities:
1. If weight is one of the predefined weight values (normal, bold, heavier, lighter), then _weight is set to that value.
2. If weight is a number (0-1000), _weight is set to that number.

Since the output is "normal", the most straightforward explanation is that the set_weight method was called with "normal" as the weight value. This directly sets _weight to "normal".

So, the input to get_weight would be a FontProperties instance where the _weight attribute is set to "normal". This could happen if set_weight was called with "normal" as an argument.

Here's my prediction for the input:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "_family": null,
        "_slant": "normal",
        "_variant": "normal",
        "_weight": "normal",
        "_stretch": "normal",
        "_file": null,
        "_size": 12.0,
        "_math_fontfamily": "dejavusans"
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
