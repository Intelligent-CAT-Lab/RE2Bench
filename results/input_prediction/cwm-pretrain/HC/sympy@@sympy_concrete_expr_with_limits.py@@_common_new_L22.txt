To determine the input for `_common_new`, let's analyze the output and match it with the function's expected parameters.

Given:
- `output` is a list containing `["1", ["(x,)"], 1]`.

Analyzing `_common_new`:
- `_common_new` is expected to return `(function, limits, orientation)` where:
  - `function` is the integrand.
  - `limits` is a list of tuples indicating the integration bounds.
  - `orientation` is an integer indicating the orientation of the integral (usually 1 for standard integrals).

We need to determine:
1. `cls` (class): This seems to be `Integral` given the context.
2. `function`: This should match the first element, `"1"`, as the integrand.
3. `discrete`: This should be `False`, as there is no indication of discrete integration in the output.
4. `symbols`: This should match the second element, `["(x,)"]`, representing the integration variable and bounds.

Final prediction for the input:
- `cls`: `Integral`
- `function`: `1`
- `discrete`: `False`
- `symbols`: `["(x,)"]`

Thus, the expected input for `_common_new` should be:
