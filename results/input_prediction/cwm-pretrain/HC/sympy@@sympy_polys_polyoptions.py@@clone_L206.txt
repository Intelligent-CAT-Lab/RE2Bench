1. The output of the `clone` method should be a copy of the current instance with updates applied.
2. In this case, the input should set the `gens` option to `["cos(phi)"]` and `fraction` to `True`.
3. The `gens` option requires a tuple of expressions, so it should be wrapped appropriately.
4. No other options are provided, so the output will only contain `fraction` and `gens`.
5. The `clone` method uses the input to update the dictionary, so I should predict the appropriate `updates` argument.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "updates": {
            "gens": ("cos(phi)",),
            "fraction": true
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

Note: The `gens` option is expected to be a tuple of expressions, so I've used a single-element tuple `("cos(phi)",)` to match the format of the original input structure.
