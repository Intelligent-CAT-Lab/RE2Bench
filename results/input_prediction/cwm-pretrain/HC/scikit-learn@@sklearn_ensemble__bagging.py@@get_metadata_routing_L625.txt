To predict the input for `get_metadata_routing`, I'll analyze the given output and determine which parameters are relevant. The output suggests that this method is mapping methods between the parent (router) and child (consumer, e.g., the estimator), particularly handling metadata and sample weights.

Key insights:
1. The `get_metadata_routing` method creates a `MetadataRouter` object.
2. It creates a `MethodMapping` to define how the parent's methods map to the child's methods.
3. It then adds the estimator to the router with this mapping.

Let's break down the parameters that are relevant based on the output and the structure provided:
- The estimator is crucial as it's being added to the router with specific method mappings.
- The method mapping includes methods like 'fit', 'predict', 'predict_proba', etc.
- The output shows that the router is capturing metadata and sample weight information for different methods.

For the input structure, I'll use a DecisionTreeClassifier as the estimator since it's a common estimator in scikit-learn and it has methods that align with the method mappings shown in the output.

Now, I'll construct the input with placeholders (XXX) where values would be needed to instantiate the object, while focusing on the relevant parameters that affect the output.

I've constructed a comprehensive input structure that aligns with the requirements for `get_metadata_routing`. By focusing on the relevant parameters that would affect the metadata routing setup, I've provided a detailed structure that should match the expected input format. The XXX placeholders indicate where specific values would be needed to fully instantiate the object, but this structure aligns with the expected structure based on the provided output and scikit-learn's API.
