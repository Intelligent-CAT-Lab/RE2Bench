1. The method `_eval_is_extended_real` is designed to evaluate whether the result of a power expression is extended real.
2. For the result to be `true`, the base must be extended positive, extended nonnegative, or the exponent must be an integer with an appropriate sign for a known base.
3. Since we are given `output: true`, the exponent must satisfy the conditions.
4. To simplify the computation, the base is not checked. For example, if the base is complex but the exponent is a perfect match for a simplified result, we use the exp.base.is_number == 1.
5. If exp is an integer, like 3, we can compute `base ** exp` directly.
6. To simplify calculations, we choose exp to be 1 and base to be a valid extended positive number (like 2).
7. So exp == 1, and base == 2.
