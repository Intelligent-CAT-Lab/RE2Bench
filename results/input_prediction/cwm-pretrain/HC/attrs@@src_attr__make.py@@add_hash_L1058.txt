`add_hash` adds a `__hash__` method to the class being built by `_ClassBuilder`. The resulting class is a new instance of `_ClassBuilder` (as seen in the output). To generate the `__hash__` method, `_make_hash_script` is called with relevant arguments.

1. `_cls` is `A`, which is the class being built.
2. `_attrs` is a list of attributes included in the hash function. Since the output shows no custom `__hash__` in the class, I assume all attributes are included by default.
3. `_frozen` controls whether the class is frozen. From the `__slots__` list and the `__setattr__`/`__delattr__` methods, I infer `__frozen__` is set to `True`.
4. `_cache_hash` determines if hashing is cached. Given the class uses caching (`self._hash_cache` field), I assume `_cache_hash` is `True`.

The function `_make_hash_script` generates the `__hash__` method using `_generate_unique_filename`, `attrs`, and the hash flag values.
