<think>
1. The function `replace_unnamed_groups` is designed to replace unnamed groups in a regex pattern with a placeholder `<var>`. 
2. In this case, the input pattern is "a/?", which does not contain any unnamed groups.
3. Therefore, the function should return the original pattern unchanged.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "^a/?$"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
