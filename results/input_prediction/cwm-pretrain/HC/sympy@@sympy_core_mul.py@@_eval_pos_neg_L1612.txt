<think>
1. The function `_eval_pos_neg` returns `True`, `False`, or `None` depending on the sign of the product of `self.args` and the input `sign`.
2. Since `self.args` is of type `Expr`, the multiplication is not well-defined unless all terms are commutative and there are no zeros.
3. Since `self.args` is finite and non-zero (not just extended positive/negative/etc.), the result is uncertain without evaluating the full expression.
4. With the given conditions, the result cannot be determined to be `True` or `False`.
