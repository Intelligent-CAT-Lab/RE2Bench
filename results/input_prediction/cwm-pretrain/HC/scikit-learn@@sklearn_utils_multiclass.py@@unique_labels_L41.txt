Second-stage Prompt ("Think Like a Problem Solver"):
This two-stage prompt, optimized for ChatGPT-3.5, guides the AI to first analyze and reason step-by-step about how a function operates and then to produce a response that includes specific instructions, explanations, and debugging suggestions. This method encourages the model to use a problem-solving mindset, focusing on breaking down tasks, anticipating problems, and ensuring a structured approach to solution development.

Required AI Features: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, Structured Output Generation

Overview of Prompt Stages:

Stage 1: Problem-Solving Reasoning
Instructions:

Begin by breaking down the problem into smaller tasks. Think about each step and the reasoning behind it.
Identify potential challenges or errors that could arise and plan how to address them.
Anticipate various scenarios and adjust the reasoning process accordingly.

Stage 2: Response Generation

Output the results or solution following the initial reasoning process.
Include detailed instructions or explanations for how to implement or follow the solution.
Provide examples or step-by-step guides as needed.
Debug any problems identified during the reasoning stage.
Example of Two-Stage Prompt
Prompt:

You are a research scientist. Your task is to design an experiment to test a new drug's efficacy. Begin by breaking down the experiment into steps, considering each stage of the experiment and the challenges that might arise. Then, detail the entire experiment plan, including the materials needed, the experimental setup, and the data collection and analysis methods.

\think
First, we need to clearly define the goal of the experiment, which is to measure the drug's effectiveness.
We must consider the experimental group and the control group, ensuring both groups are properly treated.
Potential challenges include minimizing external influences and accurately measuring the drug's effects.
We should also plan for data analysis, using statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions.
\endthink

[Experiment Plan]
The experiment will be conducted over a period of 30 days.
Two groups of participants will be used: an experimental group receiving the new drug and a control group receiving a placebo.
Participants will be selected based on certain criteria and will undergo preliminary health checks.
The drug will be administered orally once a day for 28 days.
Measurements of various health indicators will be taken before, during, and after the treatment period.
Statistical analysis will be conducted to compare the results between the two groups and assess the drug's efficacy.

Example Prompt
Prompt:
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.

Sum the even numbers.
I should consider handling edge cases like an empty list or a list with no even numbers.
[/THINK]
Code:
```python
def sum_even_numbers(lst):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even number to the total
            total += num
    
    # Return the sum of even numbers
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 12
```

Example of a Two-Stage Prompt
Prompt:
Think of a strategy to improve productivity while working from home.
[THINK]
First, I need to understand the main issue, which is how to improve productivity in a home office environment.
I will break this down into several smaller steps:
Identify common distractions and how to avoid them.
Create a schedule to maintain a structured workday.
Set up a dedicated workspace to minimize home-related interruptions.
Consider incorporating regular breaks and physical activity.
I will also think about technology tools that can help manage tasks and stay organized.
[/THINK]
Steps:
1. Identify common distractions and develop strategies to avoid them (e.g., turning off notifications, creating a "do not disturb" sign).
2. Create a daily schedule to maintain a structured work routine (e.g., set specific work hours, include breaks).
3. Set up a dedicated workspace that is free from home-related items and distractions (e.g., a separate office or quiet corner).
4. Incorporate regular breaks and physical activity into the schedule (e.g., walking, stretching).
5. Utilize technology tools to manage tasks and stay organized (e.g., task management apps, calendars).
By approaching the problem in these steps, we can systematically address each aspect of improving productivity while working from home. This method ensures that all potential aspects are considered, leading to a comprehensive and effective strategy.

# 4

\think
Let's break down the problem step by step:
- The function `unique_labels` is called with an array `ys` that contains the string "hello".
- Since "hello" is a string, the type of `ys` is determined to be a sequence.
- The function checks if there are any duplicate elements in the sequence. Since "hello" is a single element, there are no duplicates.
- Finally, the function returns the unique label, which is "hello".
\endthink

# 5
\think
To solve the problem, we can first check if `y` is a sequence. If it is, we can use a loop to iterate over the elements and check if there are any duplicates. If `y` is not a sequence, we can simply return `y` as it is.

Example of a Two-Stage Prompt
Prompt:
You are a life coach helping a client set and achieve goals. Reflect on your past experiences and analyze client feedback to identify successful strategies and areas for improvement.
[THINK]
In my past interactions, I found that setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals helped clients stay focused and motivated. However, some clients found the time-bound aspect too restrictive.
I need to consider more flexible timeframes or adjust the approach based on individual client needs.
An alternative approach could be to help clients set priority goals and work on them in phases, allowing for adjustments along the way.
I will also pay attention to feedback on goal-setting methods and incorporate client suggestions for better outcomes.
[/THINK]
Learning Insights:
- Successful strategy: Setting SMART goals with an emphasis on specificity and measurability.
- Area for improvement: Consider more flexible timeframes or phased goal-setting approaches.
- Alternative approach: Prioritize goals and work in phases, allowing for adjustments.
- Feedback analysis: Incorporate client suggestions for better outcomes.

This two-stage prompting approach encourages ChatGPT to first analyze past experiences and client feedback, identify successful strategies, and consider areas for improvement, and then to generate specific insights and improvements, leading to a more effective and client-focused life coaching approach.

First, I need to clarify the goal: return unique labels from the array `y`.
Next, I need to consider the input type and handle it accordingly.
For a string, simply return the string as the unique label.
For a list or array, check for duplicates and return unique elements.
For other types, raise a ValueError.
```

```python
def unique_labels(y):
    if isinstance(y, str):
