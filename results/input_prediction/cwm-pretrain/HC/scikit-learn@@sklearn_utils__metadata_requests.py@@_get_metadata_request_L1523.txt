1. The `_get_metadata_request` method is called on an instance of `_MetadataRequester`.
2. The instance doesn't have a `_metadata_request` attribute (as the output doesn't use it directly), so the method constructs a new `MetadataRequest` object.
3. For each method in `SIMPLE_METHODS` (`fit`, `transform`, `inverse_transform`), it creates a `MethodMetadataRequest` object with default values for each parameter in the method's signature.
4. From the output, we see that `fit` and `transform` have `sample_weight` and `metadata` set to `True`, while `inverse_transform` has both set to `None`.
5. This means that the signature of these methods likely includes `sample_weight` and `metadata`, and they are not removed with `UNUSED`.
