[/INPUT]

This input predicts that the `fit` function will be called with an empty list of estimators (`estimators`), setting the voting method to "hard", and a label encoder (`le_`) with classes [0, 1, 2]. The sample input `X` and `y` are provided as placeholders, and the `sample_weight` is not used. The `voting` method is set to "hard", and the `flatten_transform` is enabled. The `le_` attribute has a classes attribute with values [0, 1, 2]. The `estimators_` and `named_estimators_` are left as null or empty, indicating no fitted estimators.
