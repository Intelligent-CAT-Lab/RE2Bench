To predict the input for the function `_osbornei`, we need to work backward from the given output and consider how the function operates. Given the structure and the operation of `_osbornei`, which transforms trigonometric functions into hyperbolic functions using a substitution that involves `x + I*z`, we can deduce the necessary input to produce the output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)`.

The output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)` suggests that the input `e` is a trigonometric function that, when transformed by `_osbornei`, would yield this result. Given the function definition, it seems that the function applies a specific transformation rule to trigonometric functions based on their type (sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc) and the independent variable `d`.

Considering the structure provided and the nature of the transformation, a plausible input could be a trigonometric function involving `tan` since the output is a `tanh` function, which corresponds to the transformation of `tan`. The variable `d` in the function `_osbornei` is used to determine which variable in the expression `e` is independent and should be considered for the transformation.

Given the output and the structure, a reasonable guess for the input `e` could involve a `tan` function with the independent variable `d` that, when transformed, matches the output. Since the exact relationship between `x` and `z` isn't specified in the problem, and assuming `x` and `z` are parts of `d`, we can hypothesize that the input could be a `tan` function with an argument that leads to the specified output after transformation.

Thus, considering the transformation and the expected output, the input could be a trigonometric function that, when processed by `_osbornei`, results in the hyperbolic function provided in the output. However, without a direct mapping from the output to the input due to the complexity of the transformations and the lack of specific details about `x` and `z`, we can propose a generic input based on the structure provided.
