To predict the input of the `__hash__` method, we need to determine the values of the `_family`, `_slant`, `_variant`, `_weight`, `_stretch`, `_file`, `_size`, and `_math_fontfamily` attributes that would result in the given hash value of `-326180107982230538`.

The `__hash__` method is based on the `__hash__` method of a tuple, which is determined by hashing the elements of the tuple in order. In this case, the elements are:
1. `tuple(self.get_family())` - this is a tuple of strings, and the hash of a tuple is the hash of the elements in order.
2. `self.get_slant()` - this is a string, and the hash of a string is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the string.
3. `self.get_variant()` - this is a string, and the hash of a string is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the string.
4. `self.get_weight()` - this is an integer, and the hash of an integer is the integer itself.
5. `self.get_stretch()` - this is a string, and the hash of a string is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the string.
6. `self.get_size()` - this is a float, and the hash of a float is based on the binary representation of the float.
7. `self.get_file()` - this is a string, and the hash of a string is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the string.
8. `self.get_math_fontfamily()` - this is a string, and the hash of a string is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the string.

Given the complexity of hashing, it's not possible to determine the exact values of the attributes based solely on the hash value without additional information. However, we can make an educated guess based on the typical values of these attributes.

Let's assume that the `_family` is a list of strings, `_slant` is a string, `_variant` is a string, `_weight` is an integer, `_stretch` is a string, `_file` is a string, `_size` is a float, and `_math_fontfamily` is a string.

We can use the following example values:
- `_family`: `['DejaVu Sans']`
- `_slant`: `'normal'`
- `_variant`: `'normal'`
- `_weight`: `400`
- `_stretch`: `'normal'`
- `_file`: `'DejaVu Sans.ttf'`
- `_size`: `10.0`
- `_math_fontfamily`: `'stix'`

These values are commonly used defaults for font properties in Matplotlib.

I will verify the predicted inputs. 

To do this, I will use the `__hash__` method of the `FontProperties` class, which is defined as:

```python
def __hash__(self):
    l = (tuple(self.get_family()), self.get_slant(), self.get_variant(), self.get_weight(), self.get_stretch(), self.get_size(), self.get_file(), self.get_math_fontfamily())
    return hash(l)
```

I will use the predicted inputs from the previous response and calculate the hash value.
