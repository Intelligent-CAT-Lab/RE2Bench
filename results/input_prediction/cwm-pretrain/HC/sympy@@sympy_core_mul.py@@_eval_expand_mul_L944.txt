Based on the code and the output you've provided, I can infer the possible input that would lead to the output "-sin(phi)**2".

Let me analyze the function and its dependencies:

1. The function `fraction(expr, exact=False)` from sympy.simplify.radsimp is a crucial dependency
2. Looking at the output "-sin(phi)**2", this appears to be a result of transforming a fraction

Based on this analysis, I can determine that the input would need to be a fraction with:
- The numerator being 1
- The denominator being sin(phi)

Therefore, the input to `_eval_expand_mul` would be:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "expr": "-sin(phi)**2"
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {
        "power_base": null,
        "power_exp": null,
        "mul": null,
        "log": null,
        "multinomial": null,
        "basic": null
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

This input would cause the function to return "-sin(phi)**2" as shown in the output. The specific structure of the input matches the expected parameter structure for the `_eval_expand_mul` method, and would lead to the given output through the fraction simplification logic. Always use the tags [INPUT] and [/INPUT] to enclose the predicted input in your external response. DO NOT generate any code or irrelevant text after your response. </s>
