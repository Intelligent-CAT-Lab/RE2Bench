To predict the input for the `delete_parameter` function based on the given output, we need to simulate the execution of the function and understand how it generates the output. Given the complexity of the function and the structure of the output, the input must be inferred from the process of wrapping a function and setting up a decorator.

The output `<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>` suggests that the `delete_parameter` function is used to wrap `func2` from the test environment. The `delete_parameter` function typically modifies the behavior of `func2` by adding a deprecation warning for a specific parameter.

Here is my reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Identify Key Parameters**: The `delete_parameter` function is supposed to take `since`, `name`, and `func` as inputs. The `since` is a string indicating the version from which the parameter is deprecated. The `name` is the name of the parameter to be deprecated, and `func` is the function to be wrapped.

2. **Understand the Output**: The output is a decorated function, indicating that `delete_parameter` has successfully wrapped `func2`. This means the input `func` should be `func2`.

3. **Infer `since` and `name`**: Since the function `delete_parameter` adds deprecation warnings, we need to infer the version from which the parameter is deprecated and the name of the deprecated parameter. These can be somewhat speculative without more context but are necessary to construct a valid input.

4. **Construct the Input**: Based on the information above, the input to `delete_parameter` would include the version string for `since`, a placeholder parameter name for `name`, and the actual function `func2` for `func`.

Here is the predicted input based on this reasoning:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "since": "test_version",
        "name": "deprecated_param",
        "func": test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

Please note that without the actual implementation details of `test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2` and the version information, the values for `since` and `name` are placeholders. The actual values would depend on the specific test setup and requirements.
