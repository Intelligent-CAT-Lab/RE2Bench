Let me analyze the output provided and deduce what the input values should be to produce the given output from the `fit` method.

From the output:
```
{
    "output": "[ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]"
}
```
And the structure:
```
{
    "self": {
        "p0": XXX,
        "gamma": XXX,
        "ncp_prior": XXX
    },
    "args": {
        "t": XXX,
        "x": XXX,
        "sigma": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

I'll think through this step by step:
1. The output appears to be a numpy array of 4 elements, which suggests the number of change points + 1.
2. The `fit` method uses the fitness function to find optimal block boundaries.
3. Given the complexity of the calculation, we need to reverse engineer the inputs that would produce these specific edges.

<think>
1. Let's examine the fitness function and the parameters:
   - The output array has 4 values, suggesting 3 change points
   - The first value (4.36) is close to the second value (48.46), which suggests the first segment is very short
   - The last value (99.45) is significantly higher than the previous values, suggesting a long final segment

2. Looking at the `fit` method:
   - It calculates block boundaries using the inputs t, x, and sigma
   - The fitness function uses these inputs along with self parameters (p0, gamma, ncp_prior)

3. To get these specific outputs, I'll make the following assumptions:
   - Use simple values for p0, gamma, and ncp_prior that will produce a reasonable output
   - Choose t values that would naturally lead to these change points
   - Set sigma to 1 to simplify calculations
   - Use x = 1 for simplicity since we don't have specific information about x

4. Let's start with a simple case where p0 = 1, gamma = 1, and ncp_prior = 1
   - These are reasonable default values for this type of algorithm
   - We can adjust these later if needed
