1. The output matrix indicates that `row_join` should combine two matrices, resulting in a 2x4 matrix. The first matrix has two rows and two columns, and the second matrix has two rows and two columns.
2. To produce the output matrix, the first matrix should be `Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])`, and the second matrix should be `Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])`. This will result in `Matrix([[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]])` when joined.
3. The `_rep` attribute in `self` represents the internal matrix representation, and `_new` is used to create a new matrix from the given representation.
4. The `other` matrix should have the same rows and columns as the first matrix to satisfy the `row_join` condition.
