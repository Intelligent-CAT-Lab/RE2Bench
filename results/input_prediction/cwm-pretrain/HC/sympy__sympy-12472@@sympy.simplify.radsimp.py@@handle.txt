The `handle` function is called with `expr = 1 / (a - b)`. The function simplifies the input expression while maintaining the denominator.

Step-by-step:
1. The input `expr` is already a simplified expression: `1 / (a - b)`.
2. The function attempts to simplify the denominator using symbolic simplifications, such as checking for powers of 2 or extracting nested radicals, but since `a - b` is already a simple form, no further simplification is possible.
3. The function returns the expression unchanged because no simplifications are needed.

[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "expr": "1 / (a - b)"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

Remember, the input should only be the simplified expression `1 / (a - b)` without additional modifications.
