1. The output of the function is `[3. , 2. , 5. , nan, 2.5]`, which suggests the strategy is 'mean'.
2. The `nan` in the output indicates the 4th feature had no valid values, hence its mean is not computed.
3. The mean values for the other features (3, 2, 5, 2.5) correspond to the means computed from the data.
4. Given the structure, we need to construct an instance of `SimpleImputer` with the strategy set to 'mean', and we need a sparse matrix `X` with missing values to fit the model.
5. We'll construct a sparse matrix `X` with the necessary shape and content to produce the given output.
