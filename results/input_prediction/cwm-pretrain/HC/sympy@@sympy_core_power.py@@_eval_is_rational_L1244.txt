To predict the input for `_eval_is_rational`, let's analyze the function behavior and the logic flow in the provided output and code structure.

1. **Function Overview**:
   - `_eval_is_rational` is part of the `Pow` class, which likely represents an instance of a power expression (e.g., \(base^{exp}\)).
   - The method `_eval_is_rational` checks if the power expression evaluates to a rational number under certain conditions.

2. **Output Behavior**:
   - The output provided is `{"output": null}`.
   - This suggests that the conditions for the result to be `True` or `False` were not met, and the function returned `None`.

3. **Key Conditions in `_eval_is_rational`**:
   - The function first checks:
     - if `self.exp.is_integer`
     - if `self.base.is_rational`
     - and `fuzzy_not(fuzzy_and([self.exp.is_negative, self.base.is_zero]))` (i.e., if not both the base is zero and the exponent is negative).
     - In this case, the output would be `True` immediately.
   - If not, further checks on nested power structures (after `p.func(*self.as_base_exp())`) are performed.
   - In this case, the function did not return early, meaning that the first condition (if `self.exp.is_integer` and `self.base.is_rational`) did not evaluate to `True`.

4. **Possible Inputs**:
   - Given the return value of `None`, the most likely scenario is that the base and exponent do not meet the first condition (e.g., the exponent is not an integer, or the base is not rational).
   - Therefore, we need to construct an example where `self.exp.is_integer` is `False` or `self.base.is_rational` is `False` and see if this leads to the correct output.

Let's simulate a case where the exponent is a non-integer, which leads to the first condition not being satisfied and ultimately returns `None`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- Create an instance of `Pow` where `self.exp` is a non-integer (e.g., a symbolic variable) and `self.base` is a rational number.
- Since `self.exp.is_integer` is `False`, the first condition fails, and the function proceeds to evaluate the nested power structure.
- However, as `self.exp.is_integer` is `False`, the function cannot satisfy any further conditions, and it ultimately returns `None`.
