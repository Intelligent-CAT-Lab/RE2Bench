Note: 
* The X_offset_ attribute in the output seems to be the mean of the X matrix (excluding intercept), which means the intercept is not considered in the offset. So I didn't include the intercept in X for prediction.
* The y values in the args are actually the coefficient in output coef_. coef_ * X_scale + X_offset = true_coef, but I think it's better not to convert coef_ to true_coef, just using coef_ directly. 

Given all of that, I set the input as the above JSON.
