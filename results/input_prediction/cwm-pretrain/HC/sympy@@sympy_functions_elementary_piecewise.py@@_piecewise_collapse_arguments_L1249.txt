To predict the input of the `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` function given the provided output, we need to deduce the arguments that would produce such an output. The function `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` processes a list of `(expr, cond)` pairs, where `expr` is the expression and `cond` is the condition. Given the output, we need to reverse-engineer the input pairs.

The output provided is in the form of a list of tuples:
```
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [
        "(1, x < 0)",
        "(3, True)"
    ]
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
```

This suggests that the input would consist of pairs where the first element of the tuple is an expression and the second is a condition. Based on the output, we can infer the following:

1. The first pair is `(1, x < 0)`, which means the expression is `1` and the condition is `x < 0`.
2. The second pair is `(3, True)`, which means the expression is `3` and the condition is `True`.

Therefore, the input structure should be a list of tuples where each tuple contains the expression and its condition. The `XXX` in the input structure represents the actual values we've deduced. So, the predicted input would be a list with these two pairs:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "_args": [
            (1, x < 0),
            (3, True)
        ]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

Note that the actual implementation of `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` and how it processes these pairs is not provided, but based on the output, this is a reasonable prediction of what the input might look like to produce such an output.
