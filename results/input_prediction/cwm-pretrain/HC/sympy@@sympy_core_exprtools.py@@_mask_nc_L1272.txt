## PyCounterpoise v0.3
First released as a [workshop at GUADEC 2019](https://wiki.gnome.org/GUADEC19/Session) to show how an external tool could inspect the API of a program and find areas of improvement. There were two parts. One, use the code base to add more features to the static code analyzer. And second, using a simple tool called `rate`, see how the Pylint API surface was evolving.

## Code Conference 2018
Talk about how to apply sampling-based approaches to the JavaScript package ecosystem. Extending from an analysis of PyPI to NPM.

## Code Conference 2017
Introduction to the [PyCounterpoise](https://github.com/pycounterpoise) tool that was developed to analyze projects in PyPI. The talk was divided into three parts: an introduction to the theory, a live demo, and a more practical application.

intro: 
  - excerpt: 'When libraries are altered, how does their external interface change? How does the software development process change? What are the characteristics of a developer's source code, and how do they evolve in time? Many of these questions have an empirical nature, which requires a scalable analysis of both the library and the programs that utilize it.<br/><br/>To start understanding these questions, our team has developed **PyCounterpoise**, an extensible tool to compute a static analysis of a Python library, and the programs that depend on it. The analysis provides information such as which functions are exported, dependencies on third party libraries, and the set of classes and functions that are used to invoke each function.<br/><br/> Using our tool, we generated the first dataset on Python repositories that capture the interactions between library and library consumers. <br/><br/> We are leveraging this data, along with insights from other sources of data, to provide **practical guidelines** for library developers, leading to **improved stability and ease of use**.'

#### Where does the project name come from?

We want to build a tool that will help library developers understand the *counterpoise* between the structure of a library and the usage patterns of its users.

#### What languages can I expect PyCounterpoise to analyze?

Currently, the tool performs static analysis in Python using the `ast` module. This
interface is easily extended, so additional languages can be added as needed.

#### What tools can be extended and plugged into PyCounterpoise?

We aim to support two types of analysis: one that works on libraries, and
another that works on the projects that use the libraries. For the library
itself, our analysis can cover the functions and classes it exposes to users
and its documentation. For the projects, we analyze their source code to
see which functions are used and what their signatures are.

We use simple documentation analysis using regular expressions. But we also
have a text categorization classifier using [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). 

#### Where does your data come from?

For some analysis, such as API changes, we compute the analysis directly on the
Python source code. In order to ensure that our analysis is repeatable, we also
host a large data set of the analyzed projects in our [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/turinggroup/pycounterpoise-data).

#### Why have you chosen the name PyCounterpoise?

The project name derives from the concept of *counterpoise* used in
[analogy-based models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy-based_model).

#### How can I contribute?

We have a [contribution guide](https://gitlab.com/turinggroup/pycounterpoise/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
where we document the general guidelines to make our workflow easier. If you
want to send your patch as a merge request, you can assign it to one of the project's authors,
or comment on it directly
