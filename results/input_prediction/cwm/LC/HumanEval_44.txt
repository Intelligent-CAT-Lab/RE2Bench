To determine the input of `change_base`, given the output "4", I need to think about how the function works.

The function `change_base` converts a number `x` from base 10 to another base, represented as `base`. It does this by continuously dividing `x` by `base` and appending the remainder to the result string.

Let's work backwards from the output "4":
1. The final remainder when `x` is divided by `base` must be 4. So, `x % base = 4`.
2. After this, `x` becomes `x // base`. Since the output is just "4", there must be no further remainders. This implies that after the first division, `x` becomes 0.

Given these points, let's consider possible values for `x` and `base`:
- If `base` is greater than 4, then `x` must be 4 because `4 % base = 4` for any `base > 4`, and `4 // base = 0`.
- If `base` is 5 or more, `x` could be 4.

Let's test with `x = 4` and `base = 5`:
- `x % base = 4 % 5 = 4`
- `x //= base` becomes `4 // 5 = 0`, so the loop stops.

This works perfectly and results in the output "4".

Therefore, the input must be `x = 4` and `base = 5`.
