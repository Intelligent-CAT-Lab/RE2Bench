To predict the input for the `_convert_to_variance` method, I need to analyze the given output and the structure of the input.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is an instance of `VarianceUncertainty`, which is a subclass of `_VariancePropagationMixin` and `NDUncertainty`. The output contains:
   - `_unit`: A unit object with `_bases`, `_powers`, and `_scale`. Here, `_bases` and `_powers` are null, and `_scale` is 1.0, indicating a dimensionless unit.
   - `_array`: A 2D numpy array `[[  1.   4.   9.  16.  25.], [ 36.  49.  64.  81. 100.]]`.
   - `_parent_nddata`: Null, indicating no parent NDData associated with this uncertainty.

2. **Mapping to Input Structure**: The input structure has `self` with `_unit`, `_array`, and `_parent_nddata`, along with empty `args` and `kwargs`.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The `_unit` in the output has a scale of 1.0 and no bases or powers, suggesting it's a dimensionless unit. However, since `_convert_to_variance` is called on an instance of `VarianceUncertainty`, the input's `_unit` might be different but will be converted to variance units internally.
   - The `_array` in the output is a specific 2D array. Since `_convert_to_variance` doesn't modify the array (it just returns `self`), the input's `_array` should be the same as the output's `_array`.
   - `_parent_nddata` is null in the output, so it should also be null in the input.

4. **Conclusion**: The input to `_convert_to_variance` must be an instance of `VarianceUncertainty` with the same `_array` and `_parent_nddata` as the output, and a `_unit` that, when processed, results in the output's `_unit`. Given the output's `_unit` is dimensionless, the input's `_unit` could be any unit that converts to dimensionless when variance is considered, but since the method returns `self`, the input's `_unit` is likely the same as the output's.
