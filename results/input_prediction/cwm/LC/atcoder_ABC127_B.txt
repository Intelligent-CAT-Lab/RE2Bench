Let's analyze the given Python code step by step to determine the input that produced the specified output.

The code starts by reading three integers from the input: `r`, `D`, and `x`. These are mapped using the `map` function and split using the `split` method, which by default splits on whitespace.

The code then enters a loop that runs 10 times. In each iteration, it updates the value of `x` using the formula `x = r * x - D`. After updating `x`, it prints the new value.

Given the output:
```
110
120
140
180
260
420
740
1380
2660
5220
```
We need to work backwards to find the initial values of `r`, `D`, and `x`.

Starting from the last value printed, `5220`, we can deduce the previous value of `x` before the last iteration. Let's denote the value of `x` before the last iteration as `x_9`. The last iteration's calculation would be:
```
x_10 = r * x_9 - D
```
Given `x_10 = 5220`, we need to find `x_9`. However, without knowing `r` and `D`, we can't directly calculate `x_9`. Instead, let's look for a pattern or a relationship between consecutive values.

Looking at the sequence:
```
110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220
```
We can observe that each term is approximately doubling, but not exactly. Let's check the ratios between consecutive terms:
- 120 / 110 ≈ 1.09
- 140 / 120 ≈ 1.17
- 180 / 140 ≈ 1.29
- 260 / 180 ≈ 1.44
- 420 / 260 ≈ 1.62
- 740 / 420 ≈ 1.76
- 1380 / 740 ≈ 1.86
- 2660 / 1380 ≈ 1.93
- 5220 / 2660 ≈ 1.96

The ratios are increasing, suggesting that `r` might be slightly less than 2, and `D` could be a positive integer that affects the growth rate.

Let's hypothesize that `r = 2` and see if we can find suitable `D` and initial `x` values that fit the sequence.

If `r = 2`, then the formula becomes `x = 2 * x - D`.

Let's start from the first value, `110`, and work forwards to see if we can find `D` and the initial `x`:

1. `x_1 = 2 * x_0 - D = 110`
2. `x_2 = 2 * x_1 - D = 120`
3. `x_3 = 2 * x_2 - D = 140`
...

Substituting `x_1 = 110` into the second equation:
```
120 = 2 * 110 - D
120 = 220 - D
D = 220 - 120
D = 100
```

Now, let's check if `D = 100` and `r = 2` work for the entire sequence, starting from an initial `x_0`:

1. `x_1 = 2 * x_0 - 100 = 110`
   ```
   2 * x_0 = 110 + 100
   2 * x_0 = 210
   x_0 = 105
   ```

Let's verify if `x_0 = 105`, `r = 2`, and `D = 100` produce the given sequence:

1. `x_1 = 2 * 105 - 100 = 210 - 100 = 110` (matches)
2. `x_2 = 2 * 110 - 100 = 220 - 100 = 120` (matches)
3. `x_3 = 2 * 120 - 100 = 240 - 100 = 140` (matches)
4. `x_4 = 2 * 140 - 100 = 280 - 100 = 180` (matches)
5. `x_5 = 2 * 180 - 100 = 360 - 100 = 260` (matches)
6. `x_6 = 2 * 260 - 100 = 520 - 100 = 420` (matches)
7. `x_7 = 2 * 420 - 100 = 840 - 100 = 740` (matches)
8. `x_8 = 2 * 740 - 100 = 1480 - 100 = 1380` (matches)
9. `x_9 = 2 * 1380 - 100 = 2760 - 100 = 2660` (matches)
10. `x_10 = 2 * 2660 - 100 = 5320 - 100 = 5220` (matches)

All values match the given output sequence. Therefore, the initial values are `r = 2`, `D = 100`, and `x = 105`.
