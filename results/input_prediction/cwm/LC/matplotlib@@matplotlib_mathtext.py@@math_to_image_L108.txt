First, I need to understand what the `math_to_image` function does. It converts a mathematical expression into an image. The output of the function is the `depth` variable, which is returned at the end. The output given is 1.0, so I need to figure out what input would result in this output.

The `math_to_image` function uses `MathTextParser` to parse the mathematical expression `s`. The `parse` method returns a tuple containing `width`, `height`, `depth`, and two other values (which are ignored). The `depth` is then used in the `fig.text` call and ultimately returned.

Since the output is 1.0, I need to find an input `s` such that the `depth` returned by `parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)` is 1.0. The `prop` and `dpi` parameters might affect the parsing, but since they are not specified in the output, I'll assume they are default or not relevant for this specific case.

Let's consider simple mathematical expressions. For example, if `s` is a single character like "a", the depth might be 1.0. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `MathTextParser`, it's hard to say. But given the simplicity of the output, I'll assume that a simple expression like "a" would result in a depth of 1.0.

The `filename_or_obj` parameter is where the image is saved, but since the output doesn't mention anything about the file, I'll set it to a dummy value, like "dummy.png".

The `prop`, `dpi`, `format`, and `color` parameters are optional and not specified in the output, so I'll set them to `null` or default values.

Therefore, the input should be a simple mathematical expression that results in a depth of 1.0 when parsed.
