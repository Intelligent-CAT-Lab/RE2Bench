Let's break down the code step by step to determine the input that would result in the output "YES".

1. The code reads input values and splits them into integers using `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`. So, `ABC` will be a tuple of three integers.

2. The code checks if `ABC.count(5) == 2`. This means two of the integers in `ABC` must be 5.

3. If the condition in step 2 is true, it then checks if `sum(ABC) == 17`. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES".

Given the output is "YES", we know:
- `ABC.count(5) == 2` (there are exactly two 5s in the tuple)
- `sum(ABC) == 17`

Let's find three numbers where two of them are 5 and their sum is 17. Let the numbers be a, b, and c, with a = 5 and b = 5 (since we need two 5s). Then, a + b + c = 17 => 5 + 5 + c = 17 => c = 7.

So, the tuple `ABC` should be (5, 5, 7) in some order. However, the order does not matter for the sum or the count of 5s.

Therefore, the input should be the numbers 5, 5, and 7 separated by spaces.
