The given code snippet reads input from the user, replaces all commas with spaces, and then prints the result.

From the given output, we can see that the string "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" is the result after replacing commas with spaces. Since there are no commas in the output, it means that there were no commas in the original input either. However, the input must have had spaces where the commas would have been replaced. 

To find the original input, we can observe that the output string "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" has two spaces. This suggests that the original input must have had two commas, which were then replaced by spaces.

Therefore, the original input must have been "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc".
