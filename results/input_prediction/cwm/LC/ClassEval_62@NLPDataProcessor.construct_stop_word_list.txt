Given the provided output, the function `construct_stop_word_list` returns a list of stop words: ['a', 'an', 'the']. This function does not take any arguments and relies on the instance's attributes for its operation. However, in the given structure, "self" is represented as an empty dictionary, and "args" and "kwargs" are also empty. The function's output does not depend on these, so the input must be structured as per the given template with all placeholders filled appropriately, considering the function's requirements.
