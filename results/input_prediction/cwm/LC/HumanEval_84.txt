The function `solve` takes an integer `N`, sums its digits, converts that sum to binary, and returns the binary representation without the '0b' prefix.

Given the output is "1100", we know the binary representation of the sum of the digits of `N` is "1100". 

First, let's convert "1100" from binary to decimal. 
"1100" in binary is equal to 1*(2^3) + 1*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 12.

So, the sum of the digits of `N` must be 12.

Now, we need to find an integer `N` such that the sum of its digits equals 12. There are many possibilities, but let's think of a simple one. For example, if `N` is 39, the sum of its digits is 3 + 9 = 12. 

However, since there could be multiple solutions, we should choose the smallest possible `N` that satisfies this condition to make the prediction straightforward. The smallest number whose digits sum to 12 is 39 (since 3+9=12), but let's verify if there's a smaller number.

Wait, 39 is indeed the smallest number where the digits sum to 12 because any number less than 39 would have a digit sum less than 12. For example, 30 has a digit sum of 3, 31 has 4, and so on up to 38 which has a digit sum of 3+8=11. So, 39 is the smallest.

Therefore, the input `N` should be 39.
