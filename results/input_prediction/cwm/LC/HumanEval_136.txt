To determine the input of `largest_smallest_integers` given the output, let's analyze the function and the provided output.

The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from the list. If there are no negative integers, it returns `None` for the largest negative integer. Similarly, if there are no positive integers, it returns `None` for the smallest positive integer.

Given the output:
```
{
    "output": [
        -1,
        null
    ]
}
```
This means the function returned `(-1, None)`. 

- The first element `-1` indicates that there were negative integers in the list and the largest among them was `-1`.
- The second element `null` (which translates to `None` in Python) indicates that there were no positive integers in the list.

To achieve this, the input list must contain at least one negative integer (which is `-1` or less), and no positive integers.

Therefore, a possible input list could be `[-1]` or `[-1, -2, -3]`, among others, as long as it does not contain any positive integers.

Let's choose `[-1]` as a simple example that fits the criteria.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "lst": [-1]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
