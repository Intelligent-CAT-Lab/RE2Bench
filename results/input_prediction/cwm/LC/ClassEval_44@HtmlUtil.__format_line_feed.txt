To determine the input for `__format_line_feed`, let's analyze how this function works. It uses a regular expression to replace one or more newline characters (`\n+`) with a single newline (`\n`). 

Given the output is `"Some sentence here."`, we can reason about possible inputs that would result in this output after applying the function.

1. **Single Newline Input**: If the input already has a single newline (or none), the output remains the same. However, since there are no newlines in the output, we need to consider if the input might have had multiple newlines that were collapsed into one (which would still not appear in the output if the single newline is not printed or if it's at the end).

2. **Multiple Newlines Input**: The most likely scenario is that the input had multiple newlines that were reduced to a single one. However, since the output does not show any newlines, these newlines must have been at the end of the string or in a part not visible in the output (like after the period).

Given these considerations, a possible input could be a string with multiple consecutive newlines before the sentence, at the end, or both, but since the output does not display newlines, we infer that any newlines in the input were collapsed and might not be visible in the output representation provided.

However, the simplest input that would result in the given output, considering the function's behavior, is the output string itself, as it does not contain any newlines to begin with. Therefore, applying the function to this string would leave it unchanged.
