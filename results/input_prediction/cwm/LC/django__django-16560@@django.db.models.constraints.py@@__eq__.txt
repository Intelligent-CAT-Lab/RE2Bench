We are given an output of `__eq__` being `true`. The `__eq__` function checks if two `CheckConstraint` instances are equal by comparing their attributes: `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message`.

To satisfy the output, the two `CheckConstraint` instances being compared must have the same values for all these attributes.

Let's consider the structure of the `CheckConstraint` instances:
1. `name`: This should be the same for both instances.
2. `check`: This is a dictionary-like object representing a condition. For equality, both `children`, `connector`, and `negated` attributes of the `check` should be the same.
3. `violation_error_code`: This should be identical for both instances.
4. `violation_error_message`: The `_proxy____args` should be the same for both instances, as the `_proxy____kw` is an empty dictionary for both.

Based on this analysis, we can construct the input such that all attributes of the `CheckConstraint` instances match.
