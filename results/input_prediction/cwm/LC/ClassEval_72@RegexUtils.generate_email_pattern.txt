<think>
I need to predict the input to the `generate_email_pattern` method, given its output. The function doesn't take any arguments and doesn't rely on any external variables, so the structure is simple. The self object is an instance of the RegexUtils class, but since the method doesn't use any instance variables, it's irrelevant. The method simply returns a predefined string pattern. Therefore, the input should have an empty self, empty args, and empty kwargs.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
