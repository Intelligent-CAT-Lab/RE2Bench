Let's analyze the given output and function step by step to determine the possible input values.

The function `f` takes three arguments: `nums`, `pop1`, and `pop2`. It modifies the list `nums` by removing the elements at indices `pop1 - 1` and `pop2 - 1`, and then returns the modified list.

Given the output is `[1, 2, 3]`, let's consider what the original list `nums` could have been and what values `pop1` and `pop2` could have been to result in this output after the two removals.

1. **Case 1: Both removals are from the end.**
   - Suppose `nums` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - If `pop1` is 4 and `pop2` is 3, then:
     - `nums.pop(4 - 1)` removes the 4th element (4), resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - `nums.pop(3 - 1)` removes the 3rd element (3), resulting in `[1, 2]`.
   - This does not match the output, so let's consider another case.

2. **Case 2: One removal from the start, one from the middle or end.**
   - Suppose `nums` initially is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - If `pop1` is 1 and `pop2` is 3, then:
     - `nums.pop(1 - 1)` removes the 1st element (0), resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - `nums.pop(3 - 1)` removes the 3rd element (2), resulting in `[1, 3]`.
   - This also does not match the output.

3. **Case 3: Removing two elements such that the final list is exactly the output.**
   - The output `[1, 2, 3]` suggests that no elements were removed or the removed elements were not part of the final list.
   - However, since the function removes two elements, the original list must have had at least two more elements than the output.
   - Let's consider the simplest case where the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the two elements removed were 4 and 5.
     - If `pop1` is 4 and `pop2` is 5, then:
       - `nums.pop(4 - 1)` removes the 4th element (4), resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 5]`.
       - `nums.pop(5 - 1)` removes the 5th element (5), resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - This matches the output.

Therefore, one possible input could be:
- `nums` = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `pop1` = 4
- `pop2` = 5

However, there could be multiple solutions depending on the original list and the positions removed. But given the output, this is a valid solution.
