To find the input for `truncate_number` given the output `0.33000000000000007`, we need to work backward from the output. The function returns `number % 1.0`, which gives the fractional part of the number.

Given the output is `0.33000000000000007`, we can infer that the input number, when divided by 1.0, leaves a remainder of approximately `0.33`. However, due to floating-point precision issues, the actual output might be slightly different, such as `0.33000000000000007`.

The simplest input that would result in this fractional part is `0.33` itself because `0.33 % 1.0` equals `0.33`. However, considering the output's slight deviation due to floating-point representation, the actual input might be a number very close to `0.33` but not exactly `0.33`. But for the purpose of this problem, assuming the input is intended to be `0.33` is reasonable.

Therefore, the input to the function `truncate_number` should be a number that, when the fractional part is taken, results in `0.33000000000000007`.
