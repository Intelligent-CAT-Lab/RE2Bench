To determine the input `lst` for the function `double_the_difference`, let's break down the function and analyze its behavior.

The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of the squares of its elements. However, the function has several conditions that an element must meet to be included in the sum:
1. The element must be greater than 0.
2. The element must be an odd number (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`).
3. The element must not contain a decimal point (i.e., `'.' not in str(i)`).

Given the output is `0`, it implies that no elements in the input list meet all these conditions simultaneously. There are several scenarios under which this could happen:
1. The list is empty.
2. All elements in the list are less than or equal to 0.
3. All elements are even numbers.
4. All elements are not integers (have a decimal point).

However, based on the structure of the conditions, we can infer that the most straightforward reason for the output to be `0` is that either the list is empty or all elements in the list are either non-positive, even, or contain a decimal point.

Let's consider a simple case where the list is empty. This scenario directly leads to the sum being `0` without needing to check any elements.

Therefore, the input `lst` that would result in the output `0` could be an empty list `[]`.
