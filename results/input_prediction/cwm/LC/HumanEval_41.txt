To solve this problem, we need to determine the input to the function `car_race_collision` given its output. The function takes an integer `n` and returns its square. The output is 9, so we need to find the integer whose square is 9.

The square root of 9 is 3. Therefore, the input to the function `car_race_collision` must be 3.
