The output of the `delete_from_database` method is `null`, which suggests that the method executed successfully without returning any value. To predict the input, we need to consider the parameters that would lead to a successful execution of the method.

1. `database_name`: This should be a valid SQLite database file name. Let's assume it's "example.db".
2. `table_name`: This should be a valid table name in the database. Let's assume it's "users".
3. `name`: This should be a value that exists in the "name" column of the "users" table. Let's assume it's "John".

The method connects to the database, executes a DELETE query to remove the row where the "name" column matches the provided "name" value, commits the changes, and then closes the connection. Since the output is `null`, it's likely that the method executed successfully without any errors.
