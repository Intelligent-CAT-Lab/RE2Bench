1. The output indicates that the `nargs` object's `_args_set` attribute is `{'1'}`. This suggests that the `nargs` object was initialized with a single argument `'1'`.
2. The `nargs` object is part of the `self` argument in the `_eval_expand_trig` method. Therefore, we need to construct an `nargs` object that, when its `_args_set` attribute is accessed, returns `{'1'}`.
3. To create such an `nargs` object, we can infer that it was initialized with a single argument `'1'`. The `nargs` class likely handles the argument indices, and the `_args_set` attribute represents the set of argument indices that were passed during initialization.
