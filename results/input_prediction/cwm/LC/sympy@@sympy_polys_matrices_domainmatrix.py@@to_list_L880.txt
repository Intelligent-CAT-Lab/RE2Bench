To predict the input of the `to_list` function given the output, we need to understand the structure of the output and how it relates to the input.

The output is a list of lists, where each element is a string representation of a matrix. This suggests that the input is an object that can be converted to a list of lists, where each element is a matrix.

The input structure provided shows that the input is an object with a `rep` attribute, which is a dictionary of dictionaries, and a `shape` attribute, which is a tuple of integers, and a `domain` attribute.

To match the output, we need to find an input that would produce the given list of lists when converted to a list of lists.

From the provided output, we can see that the list of lists contains four matrices. The first matrix is a 2x2 matrix, the second matrix is a 2x3 matrix, the third matrix is a 3x2 matrix, and the fourth matrix is a 3x3 matrix.

The `to_list` function is defined in two different modules, `sympy.sympy.polys.matrices.ddm` and `sympy.sympy.polys.matrices.sdm`. The `to_list` function in `sympy.sympy.polys.matrices.ddm` converts a `DDM` object to a list of lists, and the `to_list` function in `sympy.sympy.polys.matrices.sdm` converts an `SDM` object to a list of lists.

The `DDM` object is a dense matrix, and the `SDM` object is a sparse matrix.

To match the output, we need to find an input that would produce the given list of lists when converted to a list of lists.

After analyzing the output, we can see that the input is an `SDM` object with the following structure:

```
{
    "self": {
        "rep": {
            "0": {
                "0": "Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])",
                "1": "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"
            },
            "1": {
                "0": "Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])",
                "1": "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"
            }
        },
        "shape": [2, 2],
        "domain": XXX
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

The `domain` attribute is not specified in the output, so we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the input of the `to_list` function is:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "rep": {
            "0": {
                "0": "Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])",
                "1": "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"
            },
            "1": {
                "0": "Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])",
                "1": "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"
            }
        },
        "shape": [2, 2],
        "domain": null
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
