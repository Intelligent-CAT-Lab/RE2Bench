Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as arguments.
2. If `k` is 0, it returns an empty list. However, in this case, the output is not an empty list, so `k` must not be 0.
3. The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
4. The function then takes the last `k` elements of the sorted array and returns them.

Given the output is `[-4, 4]`, we can deduce the following:

- Since the output contains two elements, `k` must be 2.
- The output elements are `-4` and `4`, which are the two smallest and two largest elements in the sorted array. However, since the array is sorted, the output would be the last two elements of the sorted array.

But wait, `-4` is smaller than `4`, so if `arr` is sorted, `-4` would be at the beginning of the array, not the end. This suggests that the output is not the last two elements of the sorted array, but rather the first two elements.

This implies that the array `arr` must have been `[-4, 4]` (or any array that, when sorted, becomes `[-4, 4]`), and `k` must be 2. However, if `k` is 2, the function would return the last two elements of the sorted array, which would be `[4]` if the array is `[-4, 4]` (since there are only two elements, the last two elements are the entire array).

But the output is `[-4, 4]`, which suggests that the function returned the entire array. This can only happen if `k` is equal to the length of the array. However, the output is `[-4, 4]`, which has a length of 2. So, `k` must be 2, and the array must have a length of 2.

Therefore, the input array `arr` must be `[-4, 4]`, and `k` must be 2.
