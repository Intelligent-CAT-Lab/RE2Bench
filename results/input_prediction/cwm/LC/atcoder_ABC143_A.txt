Let's work through this step by step.

The code takes two integers, A and B, and computes ans = A - 2 * B. If the result is less than 0, ans is set to 0, and then ans is printed.

Given the output is 0, there are two possible scenarios:
1. A - 2 * B equals 0.
2. A - 2 * B is less than 0, so ans is set to 0.

Let's explore both possibilities:

1. If A - 2 * B = 0, then A = 2 * B. This means A and B could be any pair where A is twice B. For example, if B = 5, then A = 10.

2. If A - 2 * B < 0, then the result is set to 0 regardless of the actual value. This could happen if A is less than 2 * B. For example, if A = 3 and B = 2, then 3 - 2 * 2 = -1, which is less than 0, so ans = 0.

However, without more information about the specific values of A and B, we can't determine the exact input. But since the question asks for "the input," we need to find a valid pair (A, B) that satisfies the condition leading to the output 0.

Let's pick a simple example where A = 2 and B = 1. Then, A - 2 * B = 2 - 2 * 1 = 0, which matches the first scenario.

So, the input could be "2 1".
