To determine the input of `dup_l1_norm` given the output, let's analyze the function and its dependencies step by step.

The function `dup_l1_norm` takes two arguments: `f` (a polynomial) and `K` (a domain). It calculates the L1 norm of the coefficients of `f` by summing the absolute values of the coefficients using `K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))`.

Given the output is `3`, we need to find a polynomial `f` and a domain `K` such that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of `f` equals `3`.

Let's consider a simple case where `f` is a polynomial with coefficients that, when their absolute values are summed, result in `3`. A straightforward example is the polynomial `x + 2`, where the coefficients are `1` and `2`, and their sum is `3`.

However, to fully determine the input, we also need to consider the domain `K`. Since the output is a simple integer `3`, it suggests that `K` could be a domain like `ZZ` (integers) or `QQ` (rationals), which would yield an integer result when summing the absolute values of coefficients.

Given these considerations, a potential input could be a polynomial `f` and a domain `K` such that the coefficients of `f` sum up to `3` when their absolute values are considered.

Here's a possible input structure based on the analysis:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "f": [1, 2],
        "K": {"__class__": "ZZ"}
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

This input suggests a polynomial `f = x + 2` (where `x` is the variable and coefficients are `1` and `2`) and the domain `K` as `ZZ` (integers), which would result in the L1 norm being `3` when the absolute values of the coefficients are summed.
