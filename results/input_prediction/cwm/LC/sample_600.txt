To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given function `f` and its output, then work backward to determine the possible input.

1. The function `f` takes an array as input and maps each number in the array to a string of 'n's repeated that many times. For example, if the array is `[3, 2, 1]`, the mapped result will be `['nnn', 'nn', 'n']`.
2. The function then appends each of these strings to `final_output` and returns it.

Given the output of `f` is an empty list `[]`, this implies that `just_ns` must also be an empty list, because there are no elements to append to `final_output`.

`just_ns` is generated by mapping over the input `array`. For `just_ns` to be empty, the input `array` must also be empty. If `array` had any elements, `just_ns` would have at least one element, which would then be appended to `final_output`, contradicting the given output.

Therefore, the input to the function `f` must be an empty array.
