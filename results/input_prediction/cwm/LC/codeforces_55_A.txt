Let's analyze the given code snippet and output to deduce the input.

The code reads an integer `n` from the input and repeatedly divides it by 2 as long as it is even. If the resulting `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the output is 'NO', we know that the final value of `n` after the division loop is not 1. This implies that the initial input number, when repeatedly divided by 2, does not result in 1.

Let's consider possible values of `n` that would lead to this outcome:

1. If `n` is an odd number greater than 1, the loop will not execute (since it only runs for even numbers), and the condition `n == 1` will be false, resulting in 'NO'.
2. If `n` is a power of 2 multiplied by an odd number greater than 1 (e.g., 2^k * m, where m > 1 and m is odd), the loop will divide out all factors of 2, leaving `n` as `m`, which is not 1, resulting in 'NO'.

To find a specific input that satisfies these conditions, let's start with small values:

- If `n = 2`, the loop will execute once, resulting in `n = 1`, which would print 'YES'. So, `n = 2` is not a valid input for the given output.
- If `n = 3`, the loop will not execute (since 3 is odd), and `n` will remain 3, resulting in 'NO'. This is a valid input for the given output.

Therefore, the input that would result in the output 'NO' is `n = 3`.
