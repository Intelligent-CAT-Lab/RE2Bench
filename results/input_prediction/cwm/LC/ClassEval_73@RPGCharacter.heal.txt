To determine the input of the `heal` method, we need to understand what the method does and how it affects the object's state. The `heal` method increases the `hp` attribute of the object by 10, but caps it at 100.

Given the output of the `heal` method is 100, we can deduce that the `hp` attribute of the object before calling `heal` must have been 90 or more, but less than 100. If it was 100 or more, the `heal` method would not change it.

However, since the exact initial value of `hp` before calling `heal` is not provided, and considering that the `heal` method adds 10 to `hp` and then caps it at 100, we can infer that the object's `hp` was at least 90 but no more than 99 before `heal` was called. 

But to provide a specific answer based on the structure provided, we will assume that the initial `hp` was 90, which is a common scenario before healing would bring it to 100.
