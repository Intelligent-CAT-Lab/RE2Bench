First, I need to figure out the input octal number that would result in the decimal output 21271. The function octal_to_decimal takes an octal number as a string and converts it to a decimal integer using the int() function with base 8.

So, the problem is essentially asking me to find the octal number (in string format) that corresponds to the decimal number 21271.

Let's convert 21271 from decimal to octal. To do this, I can repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.

21271 divided by 8 is 2658 with a remainder of 7.
2658 divided by 8 is 332 with a remainder of 2.
332 divided by 8 is 41 with a remainder of 4.
41 divided by 8 is 5 with a remainder of 1.
5 divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 5.

Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives the octal number 52417.

Therefore, the input to the function should be the string "52417".
