To determine the input of the function `f`, we need to work backwards from the given output.

The function `f` takes an array, creates a copy of it, reverses the copy, and then returns a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the reversed array.

Given the output `[1, 4, 1]`, we can deduce the following steps:

1. The output is the result of squaring each element in the reversed array. Therefore, the reversed array must have been `[1, 2, 1]` because `1^2 = 1`, `2^2 = 4`, and `1^2 = 1`.

2. Since the reversed array is `[1, 2, 1]`, the original array before reversing must have been `[1, 2, 1]` reversed, which is `[1, 2, 1]`. This is because reversing a list twice returns the original list.

Therefore, the input array to the function `f` must have been `[1, 2, 1]`.
