To determine the input for the `is_upper` method, we need to understand what makes a matrix upper triangular. A matrix is upper triangular if all the entries below the main diagonal are zero. The main diagonal runs from the top left to the bottom right of the matrix.

Given that the output is `True`, this means the matrix provided to the `is_upper` method is indeed upper triangular. 

Let's analyze the structure of the input:

1. **Rows and Columns**: The matrix must have at least one row and one column since it's upper triangular and the output is `True`. For simplicity, let's consider a square matrix (number of rows equals the number of columns) because it's a common scenario for upper triangular matrices. However, the method works for non-square matrices as well, as long as the condition holds for all elements below the main diagonal.

2. **Matrix Elements**: For a matrix to be upper triangular, all elements below the main diagonal must be zero. The elements on or above the main diagonal can be any value.

Given these considerations, a simple example of an upper triangular matrix could be:

```
{
    "self": {
        "rows": 2,
        "cols": 2,
        "_mat": [[1, 2], [0, 3]]
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

In this example, the matrix is:
```
[1, 2]
[0, 3]
```
This matrix is upper triangular because the element below the main diagonal (the 0 in the second row, first column) is zero.
