The function `sort_array` takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of it. The sorting order depends on the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is even, the array is sorted in descending order; otherwise, it is sorted in ascending order. If the array is empty, an empty list is returned.

Given the output `[5]`, we need to determine the input array that would produce this output.

First, let's analyze the output. The output is a list containing a single element, `5`. This suggests that the input array must have contained only one element, `5`, because sorting a single-element array will always result in the same array.

However, let's also consider the possibility that the input array had more than one element, but after sorting, only `5` remained. But since the output is `[5]`, it's more likely that the input array was `[5]`.

Let's test this hypothesis:

If the input array is `[5]`, then `array[0] + array[-1]` is `5 + 5 = 10`, which is even. Therefore, the array should be sorted in descending order. Since there's only one element, the sorted array is still `[5]`.

This matches the given output. Therefore, the input array must have been `[5]`.
