Let's work through this step by step.

The function `calc_max_rows_first` takes an integer `max_rows` and returns the result of the expression `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2`. We know the output is 6, so we need to find the value of `max_rows` that satisfies this equation.

Let's denote `max_rows` as `m`. The equation becomes:

`m // 2 + m % 2 = 6`

We need to solve for `m`.

First, let's consider the possible values of `m % 2`:

1. If `m` is even, then `m % 2 = 0`, and the equation simplifies to `m // 2 = 6`, which means `m = 12`.
2. If `m` is odd, then `m % 2 = 1`, and the equation simplifies to `m // 2 + 1 = 6`, which means `m // 2 = 5`, and thus `m = 11`.

So, the possible values for `m` are 11 and 12. However, since the problem asks for a single input, we need to determine which one is correct based on the context or additional constraints. Since the problem doesn't provide any additional context, we can consider both possibilities. But typically, in such problems, the smallest possible value is preferred unless stated otherwise. Therefore, we'll choose `m = 11` as the input.

Here's the input in the required format:

    "self": {},

        "max_rows": 11
