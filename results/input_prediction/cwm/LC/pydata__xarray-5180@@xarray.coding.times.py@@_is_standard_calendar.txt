I need to find an input value for the `_is_standard_calendar` function that will return `True` as the output. Let's see what the function does.

The function takes a `calendar` argument and returns `True` if the lowercase version of `calendar` is in the `_STANDARD_CALENDARS` set, which contains the strings `'standard'`, `'gregorian'`, and `'proleptic_gregorian'`.

Given that the expected output is `True`, the input `calendar` should be one of these values, case-insensitive. The possible inputs that would result in the output being `True` are:

- "standard"
- "Standard"
- "STANDARD"
- "gregorian"
- "Gregorian"
- "GREGORIAN"
- "proleptic_gregorian"
- "Proleptic_Gregorian"
- "PROLEPTIC_GREGORIAN"

Since the problem requires predicting the input, I can choose any of these options. However, typically, the simplest or most standard form is preferred. Let's choose "standard" as it is the first in the list and commonly used.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "calendar": "standard"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
