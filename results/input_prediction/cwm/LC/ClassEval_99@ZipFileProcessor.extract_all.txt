The `extract_all` method in the `ZipFileProcessor` class attempts to extract the contents of a ZIP file to a specified output path. If it fails (raises an exception), it returns `False`. Given that the output is `False`, this indicates that an exception occurred during the extraction process.

Possible reasons for the exception could be:
1. The file at `self.file_name` is not a valid ZIP file.
2. The file does not exist.
3. There is a permission issue preventing the file from being opened or the contents from being extracted.
4. The output path does not exist or there is a permission issue with the output path.

Since we need to predict the input that leads to this failure, let's consider the simplest scenario where the ZIP file does not exist. This is a common reason for such failures.

Therefore, the input `file_name` would be a non-existent file, and `output_path` could be any valid path. However, since the specific path isn't crucial to the failure (as long as the file doesn't exist), we can choose a generic path for demonstration.
