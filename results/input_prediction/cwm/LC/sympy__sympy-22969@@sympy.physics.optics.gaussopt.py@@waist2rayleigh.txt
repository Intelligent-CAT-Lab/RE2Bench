Okay, the output of `waist2rayleigh` is given as `pi*w_0**2/l`. Let me recall the function definition:

```python
def waist2rayleigh(w, wavelen, n=1):
    w, wavelen = map(sympify, (w, wavelen))
    return w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen
```

So the formula is `(w^2 * n * pi) / wavelen`. The output is `pi*w_0**2/l`, which matches this structure. Comparing term by term:

- `w` must be `w_0`
- `wavelen` must be `l`
- `n` is not explicitly mentioned, so it defaults to 1.

Therefore, the inputs should be `w=w_0`, `wavelen=l`, and `n=1`.
