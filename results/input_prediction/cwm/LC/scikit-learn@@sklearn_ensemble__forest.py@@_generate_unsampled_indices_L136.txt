To determine the input values, let's break down the output of the function and trace back to the inputs. The output lists several indices that were not sampled during the bootstrapping process. This tells us that some elements were not included in the sampled indices generated by `_generate_sample_indices`.

The `_generate_unsampled_indices` function first calls `_generate_sample_indices` to get the sampled indices. Then, it counts how many times each index appears in the sample using `np.bincount`. The unsampled indices are those with a count of zero.

Given the output, we know that the unsampled indices are numerous, suggesting that the number of bootstrap samples (`n_samples_bootstrap`) is less than the total number of samples (`n_samples`). 

The function uses `np.arange(n_samples)` to create a range of indices from 0 to `n_samples - 1`. The unsampled indices are derived by filtering this range to include only those indices with a count of zero in `sample_counts`.

To reverse-engineer the inputs:

1. **random_state**: This is used to seed the random number generator. Without knowing the exact state, it's hard to determine, but it's typically an integer or a numpy RandomState object. However, since the output doesn't directly depend on the random state but rather on the counts, we might not need to specify it exactly, but for completeness, let's assume it's a specific integer (e.g., 0).

2. **n_samples**: This is the total number of samples. From the output, the maximum unsampled index is 149, suggesting that `n_samples` must be at least 150 (since indices start at 0). Let's assume `n_samples = 150`.

3. **n_samples_bootstrap**: This is the number of samples to draw for each bootstrap sample. The number of unsampled indices (51 in the output) implies that the bootstrap sample size is less than `n_samples`. A common choice for bootstrap sampling is to use the same size as the original dataset, but since we have unsampled indices, it must be less. Let's assume `n_samples_bootstrap = 100` for this example.

Therefore, the input should be:
