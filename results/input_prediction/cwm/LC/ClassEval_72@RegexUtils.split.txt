To predict the input of the `split` function given the output, let's analyze the provided output and the structure of the input.

The output is a list of strings:
```
[
    "",
    " abiguygusu ",
    " kjgufwycs ",
    ""
]
```
This suggests that the `text` argument was split into parts based on a `pattern`. The empty strings at the beginning and end indicate that the `pattern` matched at the start and end of the `text`, respectively.

Given the structure of the input:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": XXX,
        "text": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
We need to determine the values of `pattern` and `text`.

Let's consider possible patterns and texts that could produce the given output. One possibility is that the `pattern` is a string that matches a specific sequence of characters, and the `text` contains this sequence in such a way that it produces the given output when split.

After analyzing the output, I believe the `pattern` could be a string that matches a specific sequence of characters, and the `text` could be a string that contains this sequence in such a way that it produces the given output when split.

Here's my prediction for the input:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "pic",
        "text": "pic abiguygusu pic kjgufwycs pic"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
