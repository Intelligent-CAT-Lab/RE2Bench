The given Python code snippet is `print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))`. This code takes an input character, increments its ASCII value by 1, and then prints the corresponding character.

Given the output is "b", we need to find the input character. The ASCII value of 'b' is 98. To get 'b' as output, the input character's ASCII value must be 97 (since 97 + 1 = 98). The character with ASCII value 97 is 'a'.

Therefore, the input to the function must be 'a'.
