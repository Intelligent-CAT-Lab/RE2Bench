Let's break down the code step by step to find the input that leads to the output of 0.

1. The code starts by reading three integers from the input: `N`, `A`, and `B`. These are used to calculate a certain value.
2. The first calculation is `ans = N // (A + B) * A`. This means that `N` is divided by the sum of `A` and `B`, and the result is multiplied by `A`.
3. The second calculation is `rem = N % (A + B)`. This finds the remainder of `N` divided by the sum of `A` and `B`.
4. The final calculation is `ans += min(rem, A)`. This adds the minimum of `rem` and `A` to `ans`.
5. The output is `print(ans)`.

Given that the output is 0, we can deduce the following:
- `N // (A + B) * A` must be 0 because it's the first part of the `ans` calculation.
- `rem` (the remainder of `N` divided by `A + B`) must also be 0 or less than `A` because `min(rem, A)` is added to `ans` and the final result is still 0.

The only way `N // (A + B) * A` can be 0 is if `N` is less than `A + B` or if `A` is 0. However, if `A` is 0, then `min(rem, A)` would always be 0, and `ans` would be 0 regardless of `N` and `B`. But since `A` and `B` are integers, and the problem likely expects positive integers, let's consider the case where `N` is less than `A + B`.

If `N` is less than `A + B`, then `N // (A + B)` would be 0, making `ans` 0. In this case, `rem` would be `N`, and `min(rem, A)` would be `min(N, A)`. For `ans` to remain 0, `min(N, A)` must also be 0. This implies that either `N` is 0 or `A` is 0.

However, if `A` is 0, the calculation `ans = N // (A + B) * A` would always result in 0, and `min(rem, A)` would also be 0, making the final `ans` 0 regardless of `N` and `B`. But this seems unlikely given the context of the problem.

Therefore, the most straightforward solution is that `N` is 0, and `A` and `B` are any positive integers. This would make `ans` 0 because `N // (A + B) * A` is 0, and `min(rem, A)` is also 0 because `rem` is 0.

So, the input that leads to the output of 0 is when `N` is 0, and `A` and `B` are any positive integers. For simplicity, let's choose `A = 1` and `B = 1`.
