To determine the input of `_interval_contains_close` given the output, let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. **Understanding the function `_interval_contains_close`**:
   - The function takes an interval (a tuple or list of two values), a value `val`, and an optional relative tolerance `rtol`.
   - It checks if `val` is within the interval `[a, b]` (after possibly swapping `a` and `b` if `a > b`), considering a tolerance defined by `rtol * (b - a)`.

2. **Given Output**:
   - The output is `np.True_`, indicating that the condition in the function was met, meaning `val` is within the interval `[a, b]` with the given tolerance.

3. **Deducing Input Values**:
   - Since the output is `np.True_`, `val` must be within the interval `[a, b]` considering the tolerance.
   - Let's assume a simple case where `a <= val <= b` and `rtol` is not affecting the outcome significantly (i.e., `rtol` is small or `val` is well within the interval).
   - A straightforward case to satisfy the output is when `val` is exactly in the middle of `a` and `b`, or at one of the endpoints.

4. **Choosing Specific Values**:
   - Let's choose `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `val = 0.5` as a simple example where `val` is within the interval.
   - For `rtol`, since it's an optional parameter with a default value, we can choose not to specify it, thus `rtol = 1e-10` by default.

Given these considerations, the input to `_interval_contains_close` that results in the output `np.True_` could be:

    "self": {},

        "interval": [0, 1],
