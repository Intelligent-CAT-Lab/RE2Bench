1. The output shows that the function returns a dictionary with specific keys and values, indicating successful registration of post-transforms.
2. The input to the `setup` function includes a `Sphinx` object (`app`), which is necessary for adding post-transforms via `add_post_transform`.
3. Since the return value indicates both `parallel_read_safe` and `parallel_write_safe` are `True`, the input doesn't affect these flags; they are hardcoded in the function.
4. The `app` argument must be a valid instance of `Sphinx` to call `add_post_transform` successfully.
