Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the function**: The `interval_contains` function checks if a given value `val` lies within a specified `interval`. The interval is defined by two values, `a` and `b`. If `a > b`, the function swaps them to ensure `a` is the lower bound and `b` is the upper bound.

2. **Output Analysis**: The output is `np.True_`, which indicates that the condition `a <= val <= b` evaluated to `True`. This means `val` is within the bounds defined by `interval`.

3. **Interval and Value Prediction**: To satisfy the condition `a <= val <= b`, the value of `val` must be between the two endpoints of the interval. For simplicity, let's consider an interval where `a <= b` directly (no need to swap). A common case where this holds true is when `val` is equal to one of the endpoints or lies within them.

4. **Input Construction**: Based on the structure provided, we need to fill in the `interval` and `val` placeholders. Let's choose an interval and a value that would make the function return `True`. For example, if the interval is `[1, 5]` and `val` is `3`, the function would return `True`.

Here's how we can construct the input:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "interval": [1, 5],
        "val": 3
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
