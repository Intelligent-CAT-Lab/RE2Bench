To solve this problem, we need to determine the complex numbers c1 and c2 that, when multiplied together, result in the output (-5+10j).

The formula for multiplying two complex numbers is:

(c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag) + (c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real)j

Let's denote c1 = a + bi and c2 = c + di, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers.

We are given that the result of the multiplication is -5 + 10j. This gives us two equations:

1) a*c - b*d = -5 (real part)
2) a*d + b*c = 10 (imaginary part)

We need to find values of a, b, c, and d that satisfy these equations.

One possible solution is:
c1 = 1 + 2j
c2 = 3 + 4j

Let's verify:
(1 + 2j)(3 + 4j) = (1*3 - 2*4) + (1*4 + 2*3)j = (3 - 8) + (4 + 6)j = -5 + 10j

This matches the given output.

So, the input to the multiply function would be c1 = 1 + 2j and c2 = 3 + 4j.
