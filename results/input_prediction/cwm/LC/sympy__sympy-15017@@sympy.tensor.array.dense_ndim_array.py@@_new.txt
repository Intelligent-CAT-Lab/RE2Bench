The function `ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new` is responsible for creating a new instance of the `ImmutableDenseNDimArray` class. Given the output object, we need to determine what the input arguments would have been to produce this output.

First, let's analyze the output attributes:
- `_shape`: It's empty (`{}`), but in the class definition, it's set to `Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))`. However, in this case, it seems to have been overwritten or not properly set, which might indicate a mistake or a special case. We'll assume the shape was intended to be a valid tuple but got corrupted or not properly initialized here. Given that `_rank` is 2 and `_loop_size` is 4, the shape should be a 2x2 matrix (since 2x2=4). So the intended shape might have been `(2, 2)`.
- `_array`: It's `null`, which suggests that the flat list of elements might not have been properly initialized or was not intended to be used directly here.
- `_rank`: This is 2, indicating a 2-dimensional array.
- `_loop_size`: This is 4, which is the product of the dimensions (2x2), confirming the shape is likely `(2, 2)`.

Now, looking at the input structure:
- `cls` is the class itself (`ImmutableDenseNDimArray`).
- `iterable` should be a structure that can be flattened into the elements of the array. Since `_array` is `null`, and assuming the actual elements are not relevant here (as they are not provided in the output), we can consider `iterable` to be a placeholder or an empty structure, but given the shape is (2, 2), it should represent a 2x2 matrix. However, the exact elements are not specified, so we'll leave it as a generic matrix structure.
- `shape` should be `(2, 2)` based on the analysis above.

Given these considerations, the input to the `_new` method would involve a class reference, an iterable representing a 2x2 matrix (with unspecified elements), and the shape `(2, 2)`.
