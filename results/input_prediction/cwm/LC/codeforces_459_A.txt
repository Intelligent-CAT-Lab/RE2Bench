Let's break down the given Python code and the output to determine the input.

The code reads four integers from the input, which are stored in the variables `anti`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then calculates the absolute differences between `anti` and `c`, and between `b` and `d`, storing these in `l` and `m` respectively.

The code then checks the following conditions:

1. If `anti` is equal to `c`, it prints `anti + m`, `b`, `c + m`, and `d`.
2. Else if `b` is equal to `d`, it prints `anti`, `b + l`, `c`, and `d + l`.
3. Else if `l` is not equal to `m`, it prints `-1`.
4. Else, it prints `anti`, `d`, `c`, and `b`.

Given the output `3 8 7 4`, we need to determine which condition was met.

Let's analyze the output:

- The output consists of four numbers: `3`, `8`, `7`, and `4`.
- Since the output is not `-1`, the third condition (`l != m`) was not met. This means `l` must be equal to `m`.
- The first two conditions (`anti == c` and `b == d`) are not met because the output does not match the pattern of these conditions. For example, if `anti == c`, the output would have `anti + m` and `c + m` as the first and third numbers, but in the given output, the first and third numbers are `3` and `7`, which do not follow this pattern.
- Therefore, the fourth condition must have been met, which means `anti`, `d`, `c`, and `b` were printed in that order.

So, we have:
- `anti = 3`
- `d = 8`
- `c = 7`
- `b = 4`

Now, let's verify if `l` is equal to `m`:
- `l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4`
- `m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4`
- Since `l` is equal to `m`, the fourth condition is indeed met.

Therefore, the input must have been `3 4 7 8`.
