The function `get_gpa` calculates the GPA of a student by taking the average of the grades in their courses. The output is 75.0, which is the average of two courses. Let's look at the possible combinations:

For a GPA of 75.0, the student must have two courses with grades that add up to 150. The only combination that works is 75 and 75 (since 75 + 75 = 150, and 150 / 2 = 75).

Looking at the structure, the student "Charlie" has two courses: "Chemistry" and "Physics". If both courses have a grade of 75, then Charlie's GPA would be 75.0.

So, the input should be the name "Charlie".
