Okay, I need to figure out what input would make the function `get_encodings_from_content` return `["UTF-8"]`. Let's break down how this function works.

The function uses three regular expressions to search for encoding specifications in a given HTML content string:
1. `charset_re`: Looks for `<meta>` tags with a `charset` attribute, like `<meta charset="UTF-8">`.
2. `pragma_re`: Looks for `<meta>` tags with a `content` attribute that includes `charset=`, such as `<meta content="charset=UTF-8">`.
3. `xml_re`: Looks for XML declarations that specify encoding, like `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

The function combines the matches from all three regex patterns and returns them as a list.

The output given is `["UTF-8"]`, so the input content must contain at least one match for one of these patterns that results in "UTF-8". Let's consider possible content strings that would trigger this.

Possible scenarios:
- The content includes a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag.
- The content includes a `<meta content="charset=UTF-8">` tag.
- The content starts with `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

Since the output is a single "UTF-8", it's likely that only one of these patterns matches. Let's pick the simplest case: a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag.

So, the input content could be something like:
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`

But to be safe, maybe the content has other tags but only one relevant match. However, the simplest input would be the meta tag itself.

Now, let's structure this into the required input format.

[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "content": "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]
