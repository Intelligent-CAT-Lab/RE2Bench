The deposit function adds a specified amount to the account balance. The output is 300, meaning the new balance after deposit is 300. Let's find out the initial balance and the amount deposited.

Assume the initial balance (self.balance) was X and the amount deposited (amount) was Y. Then, X + Y = 300. 

Since the amount deposited cannot be negative (as per the function's check), Y must be a positive number. 

If we consider a simple case where the initial balance was 0, then the amount deposited would be 300. But without knowing the exact initial balance, we can't be certain. However, given the structure provided, we need to fill in the placeholders. 

Given that the output is 300, a plausible scenario is that the initial balance was 0 and the amount deposited was 300. This would result in a new balance of 300, which matches the output.
