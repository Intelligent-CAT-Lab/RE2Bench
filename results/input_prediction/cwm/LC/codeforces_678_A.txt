Let's think step by step to predict the input of the code snippet.

The code reads two integers, `vamshi` and `z`, from the input and prints the result of the expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`.

Given the output is 15, we need to find the values of `vamshi` and `z` that satisfy this equation.

Let's analyze the expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`:
- `vamshi // z` performs integer division of `vamshi` by `z`.
- Adding 1 to the result and then multiplying by `z` essentially rounds up `vamshi` to the nearest multiple of `z`.

To get an output of 15, `vamshi` must be a number that, when rounded up to the nearest multiple of `z`, equals 15.

Let's consider possible values for `z` and `vamshi`:

1. If `z` is 5, then `vamshi` could be 11, 12, 13, or 14, because rounding up any of these numbers to the nearest multiple of 5 gives 15.
2. If `z` is 3, then `vamshi` could be 13 or 14, because rounding up either of these numbers to the nearest multiple of 3 gives 15.
3. If `z` is 1, then `vamshi` must be 15, because rounding up 15 to the nearest multiple of 1 is still 15.

However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on `z` or `vamshi`, we can choose the simplest solution where `z` is 1 and `vamshi` is 15.

Therefore, the input that would produce the given output is:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "15 1"
}
```
