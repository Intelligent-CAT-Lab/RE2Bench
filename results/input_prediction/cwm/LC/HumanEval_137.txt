Let's think step by step to solve this problem.

We are given a function `compare_one(a, b)` and its output. We need to determine the input values `a` and `b` that would produce this output.

The function does the following:
1. Checks if `a` and `b` are strings. If they are, it replaces any commas with periods.
2. Converts both values to floats.
3. Compares the two floats. If they are equal, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the larger of the two original values.

The output is `"2,3"`, which is a string. This suggests that one of the inputs was greater than the other, and the function returned the larger one as a string.

Since the output is `"2,3"`, it is likely that one of the inputs was `"2,3"` and the other was a value that is less than `"2,3"` when converted to a float. However, if `"2,3"` was compared to another string like `"2.3"`, the comma would be replaced with a period, making them equal. Therefore, the other input must be a value that is less than `"2.3"` when converted to a float.

Let's consider possible inputs:
- If `a = "2,3"` and `b = "2,2"`, then `temp_a = "2.3"` and `temp_b = "2.2"`. Since `2.3 > 2.2`, the function returns `"2,3"`.
- If `a = "2,2"` and `b = "2,3"`, then `temp_a = "2.2"` and `temp_b = "2.3"`. Since `2.2 < 2.3`, the function returns `"2,3"`.

Both scenarios are possible, but we need to choose one. Let's assume `a = "2,3"` and `b = "2,2"`.

Therefore, the input to the function `compare_one` would be:

    "self": {},

        "a": "2,3",
        "b": "2,2"

}
