From the output `print(a * b // 100) = 2017634310362021`, we can know that `a * b` must be a number that, when divided by 100 using integer division, results in 2017634310362021. So, `a * b` must be in the range [201763431036202100, 201763431036202199].
Given that the input is split into `a` and `b` where `a` is an integer and `b` is a string that is then converted to an integer after modifying it, we can reconstruct possible values.
`a` must be a number, and `b` must be a string that, when its second character is removed, results in a number that, when multiplied by `a`, falls within the range [201763431036202100, 201763431036202199].
Since `a` and `b` are split from the input string, the input string must be in the format `a b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a string.
Let's try to find suitable values for `a` and `b`.
First, let's consider the range of `a * b`. Since `a * b // 100 = 2017634310362021`, `a * b` must be approximately 201763431036202100.
If we assume `a` is a small number, say around 1000, then `b` would need to be around 201763431036202100 / 1000 = 2017634310362021.
However, `b` is a string that is modified by removing its second character, so it's unlikely to be such a large number.
Alternatively, if `a` is a large number, say around 2017634310362021, then `b` would need to be around 100.
But `b` is a string that is modified by removing its second character, so it's possible that `b` is a 3-digit number where the second digit is removed.
Let's try `b` = "100". If we remove the second character, we get "10", which is 10. Then `a` would need to be around 2017634310362021 * 100 / 10 = 201763431036202100.
But `a` is an integer, so it's possible.
However, the input string would be "201763431036202100 100", which is a very long string.
Alternatively, let's try `b` = "abc" where `a` is an integer and `c` is a digit. If we remove the second character `b`, we get `ac`, which is a 2-digit number.
Then `a * ac` must be around 201763431036202100.
If we assume `ac` is around 100, then `a` would need to be around 2017634310362021.
But `a` is an integer, so it's possible.
However, the input string would be "2017634310362021 abc", which is also a very long string.
Let's try to find a simpler solution.
Since `a * b // 100 = 2017634310362021`, `a * b` must be in the range [201763431036202100, 201763431036202199].
Let's try `a` = 2017634310362021 and `b` = 100. Then `a * b` = 201763431036202100, which is in the range.
However, `b` is a string that is modified by removing its second character, so it's possible that `b` is "100" and `a` is 2017634310362021.
But the input string would be "2017634310362021 100", which is a very long string.
Alternatively, let's try `a` = 2017634310362021 and `b` = "100". Then `a * b` = 201763431036202100, which is in the range.
However, `b` is a string that is modified by removing its second character, so it's possible that `b` is "100" and `a` is 2017634310362021.
But the input string would be "2017634310362021 100", which is a very long string.
Wait, but the problem states that the input is in the format `a b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a string.
So, the input string must be "2017634310362021 100".
