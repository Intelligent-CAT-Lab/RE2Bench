To solve this, let's analyze the `subtract` method of the `ComplexCalculator` class. The method takes two complex numbers, `c1` and `c2`, and returns a new complex number where the real part is the difference between the real parts of `c1` and `c2`, and the imaginary part is the difference between the imaginary parts of `c1` and `c2`.

Given the output `(2-2j)`, we know that the resulting complex number has a real part of `2` and an imaginary part of `-2`.

Let's denote `c1` as `a + bi` and `c2` as `c + di`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are real numbers.

The subtraction operation can be broken down as follows:
- Real part: `a - c = 2`
- Imaginary part: `b - d = -2`

We need to find values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy these equations.

One possible solution is:
- Let `a = 3` and `c = 1`, so `a - c = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- Let `b = -1` and `d = 1`, so `b - d = -1 - 1 = -2`.

Thus, `c1` could be `3 - 1j` and `c2` could be `1 + 1j`.

Therefore, the input to the `subtract` method could be:
