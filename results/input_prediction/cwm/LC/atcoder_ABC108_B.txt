Let's analyze the given Python code and output to predict the input. 

The code takes four integers as input, representing the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It then calculates two new points by shifting the original points using the differences in x and y coordinates. The output is the coordinates of these new points.

The output is given as "101 99 101 100". This means the new coordinates are (101, 99) and (101, 100).

From the code, we can see that the new x-coordinate is calculated as x2 - b, where b = y2 - y1. Similarly, the new y-coordinate is calculated as y2 + a, where a = x2 - x1.

Let's denote the original coordinates as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). We know that:
- a = x2 - x1
- b = y2 - y1

The new coordinates are:
- (x2 - b, y2 + a) = (101, 99)
- (x1 - b, y1 + a) = (101, 100)

From the first new coordinate (101, 99):
1. x2 - b = 101
2. y2 + a = 99

From the second new coordinate (101, 100):
3. x1 - b = 101
4. y1 + a = 100

Since a = x2 - x1 and b = y2 - y1, we can substitute these into the equations.

From equations 1 and 3:
x2 - b = x1 - b => x2 = x1

This means x1 and x2 are the same.

From equations 2 and 4:
y2 + a = y1 + a => y2 = y1

This means y1 and y2 are the same.

Wait, that would mean the original points are the same, which would result in a = 0 and b = 0. But then the new coordinates would be the same as the original, which contradicts the output.

Let's re-examine the equations. If x2 = x1, then a = 0. If y2 = y1, then b = 0. This would indeed result in the new coordinates being the same as the original, which is not the case here.

So, our initial conclusion that x2 = x1 and y2 = y1 must be incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

Let's assume x1, y1, x2, y2 are distinct.

From the new coordinates:
(x2 - b, y2 + a) = (101, 99)
(x1 - b, y1 + a) = (101, 100)

This implies that the x-coordinates of both new points are the same (101), and the y-coordinates differ by 1 (99 and 100).

Let's denote the difference in x-coordinates as a = x2 - x1, and the difference in y-coordinates as b = y2 - y1.

Then:
x2 - b = 101
y2 + a = 99
x1 - b = 101
y1 + a = 100

From x2 - b = 101 and x1 - b = 101, we get x2 = x1.

From y2 + a = 99 and y1 + a = 100, we get y2 = y1 - 1.

Since a = x2 - x1 = 0 (because x2 = x1), and b = y2 - y1 = -1 (because y2 = y1 - 1), let's substitute these back into the equations.

If a = 0 and b = -1, then:
x2 - b = x2 + 1 = 101 => x2 = 100
y2 + a = y2 + 0 = y2 = 99
x1 - b = x1 + 1 = 101 => x1 = 100
y1 + a = y1 + 0 = y1 = 100

So, the original coordinates are (x1, y1) = (100, 100) and (x2, y2) = (100, 99).

Let's verify this:
a = x2 - x1 = 100 - 100 = 0
b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1

New coordinates:
(x2 - b, y2 + a) = (100 - (-1), 99 + 0) = (101, 99)
(x1 - b, y1 + a) = (100 - (-1), 100 + 0) = (101, 100)

This matches the given output. Therefore, the input must be the original coordinates (100, 100) and (100, 99).
