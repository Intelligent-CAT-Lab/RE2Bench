First, let's analyze what the function does. The function `f` takes a list of numbers `num` as input and appends its last element to itself. For example, if `num` is `[a, b, c]`, then after the function runs, it becomes `[a, b, c, c]`.

Given the output:
```
[
    -70,
    20,
    9,
    1,
    1
]
```
We can see that the last two elements are both `1`. This suggests that the last element of the original `num` list was `1`. 

Therefore, the original list before running the function must have been `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`.
