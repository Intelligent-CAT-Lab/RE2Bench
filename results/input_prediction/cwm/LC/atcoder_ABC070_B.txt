Let's break down the problem step by step.

The code snippet is:

```
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
print(max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)))
```

The output is:

```
{
    "output": 0
}
```

This means that the expression `min(b, d) - max(a, c)` must be less than or equal to 0, because the `max(0, ...)` function will return 0 in that case.

Let's consider the possible values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that would result in this output.

Since `min(b, d) - max(a, c)` is less than or equal to 0, we can write:

`min(b, d) <= max(a, c)`

This means that either `b` or `d` (whichever is smaller) is less than or equal to either `a` or `c` (whichever is larger).

To satisfy this condition, we can choose values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `b` and `d` are both less than or equal to `a` and `c`.

For example, let's choose:

`a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 2`, `d = 0`

In this case:

`min(b, d) = min(0, 0) = 0`

`max(a, c) = max(1, 2) = 2`

`min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 0 - 2 = -2`

`max(0, -2) = 0`

This satisfies the condition, and the output will be 0.

Therefore, the input that would result in this output is:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "1 0 2 0"
}
```
[/INPUT]
