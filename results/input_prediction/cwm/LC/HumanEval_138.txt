To predict the input for the function `is_equal_to_sum_even`, given the output is `true`, we need to understand what conditions make the function return `true`.

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` checks two conditions:
1. `n % 2 == 0` - This means `n` must be an even number.
2. `n >= 8` - This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.

Given that the output is `true`, the input `n` must satisfy both conditions.

So, for `n % 2 == 0` to be true, `n` could be any even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...).
For `n >= 8` to be true, `n` must be 8 or any even number greater than 8.

Combining both conditions, the possible values for `n` that would make the function return `true` are 8, 10, 12, and so on.

However, since we need to predict a single input that results in the given output, we'll choose the smallest possible value that satisfies both conditions, which is `8`.

Here's the predicted input in the required format:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 8
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
