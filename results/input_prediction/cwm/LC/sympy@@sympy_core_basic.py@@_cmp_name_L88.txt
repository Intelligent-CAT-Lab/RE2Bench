To solve this problem, we need to understand the logic of the `_cmp_name` function and how it compares two types, `x` and `y`.

1. The function first retrieves the names of `x` and `y` using `x.__name__` and `y.__name__`. If these names are equal, the function returns 0, indicating that `x` and `y` are considered equal in terms of their names.

2. If `y` is not a subclass of `Basic`, the function returns -1. This suggests that `y` is considered "less than" `x` if `x` is a subclass of `Basic` and `y` is not.

3. The function then checks if both `x` and `y` are not found in the `ordering_of_classes` list. If they are not found, it compares their names lexicographically and returns the result.

4. If one or both of `x` and `y` are found in `ordering_of_classes`, it compares their positions in the list and returns the result.

Given the output of the function is 1, we can deduce the following:

- The names of `x` and `y` are not equal.
- `y` is a subclass of `Basic`.
- The position of `x` in `ordering_of_classes` is greater than the position of `y`, or both are not in the list and `x`'s name is lexicographically greater than `y`'s name.

However, without knowing the exact order of classes in `ordering_of_classes` or the specific types of `x` and `y`, we can make a general assumption based on the function's behavior.

Let's assume `x` and `y` are types that are subclasses of `Basic` and their names are different. Given the output is 1, it implies that `x` is considered "greater than" `y` based on the function's comparison logic.

For simplicity, let's assume `x` is a type that comes after `y` in the `ordering_of_classes` list, or `x`'s name is lexicographically greater than `y`'s name if they are not in the list.

Therefore, a possible input could be:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "x": "type_x",
        "y": "type_y"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

However, to accurately predict the input, we would need more specific information about the types `x` and `y` and their positions in `ordering_of_classes`. The above input is a simplified assumption based on the function's behavior and the given output.
