To find the input of `__eq__` given the output is `false`, we need to understand the conditions under which `__eq__` returns `False`.

1. **Understanding `__eq__`**: The method checks if `other` is an instance of `PurePath`. If so, it delegates to the parent class's `__eq__` method.
2. **String Comparison with Warning**: If `other` is a `str`, it raises a deprecation warning and compares the string representation of `self` with `other`.
3. **Other Types Return `NotImplemented`**: For other types, it returns `NotImplemented`.

Given the output is `False`, let's consider possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: `other` is a `PurePath` instance but not equal to `self`.
- **Scenario 2**: `other` is a `str` that does not match the string representation of `self`.
- **Scenario 3**: `other` is neither a `PurePath` nor a `str`, leading to `NotImplemented`, but since the output is `False`, this scenario is less likely unless the comparison is handled elsewhere.

To determine the exact input, let's assume `self` is an instance of `_StrPath` (a subclass of `PosixPath`). Let's also assume `self` represents a path, for example, `"/path/to/some/file.txt"`.

If `other` is a `PurePath` instance that represents a different path, the comparison would return `False`. Alternatively, if `other` is a string that does not match the string representation of `self`, it would also return `False` after raising a warning.

Let's choose `other` as a `PurePath` instance representing a different path to satisfy the condition without triggering a warning.
