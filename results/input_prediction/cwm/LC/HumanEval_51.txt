The output of the function is "bcdf\nghjklm". This suggests that the input text had vowels removed, leaving the characters 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm'. The presence of a newline character '\n' indicates that the original text had a newline, which was preserved since the function doesn't remove non-alphabet characters.

To reconstruct the original input, we need to insert vowels back into the output in a way that could have been removed by the function. However, the function removes vowels regardless of their case, so we can insert any combination of vowels (lowercase or uppercase) into the output string.

One possible original input could be "abcdef\nghijklm", where the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i' are removed, resulting in "bcdf\nghjklm".
