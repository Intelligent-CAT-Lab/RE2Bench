I need to determine the input to the `parse` function given the output `<Version('1.11.3')>`. The `parse` function attempts to create a `Version` object. If it fails, it falls back to `LegacyVersion`. 

The key is understanding how the `Version` class parses the input string. The `Version` class uses a regular expression to break down the version string into components like release, pre-release, post-release, dev, and local versions. Given the output is a valid `Version` object with the string `'1.11.3'`, the input must be a string that matches the expected format for the `Version` class.

The `Version` class's regular expression likely expects a string in the format of `<release>[.<release>]*[.<pre_l><pre_n>]?[.<post_l><post_n>]?[.<dev_l><dev_n>]?[+<local>]?`, where:
- `<release>` is one or more digits separated by dots (e.g., `1.11.3`).
- `<pre_l>` and `<pre_n>` represent pre-release labels and numbers (e.g., `a1`, `b2`).
- `<post_l>` and `<post_n>` represent post-release labels and numbers (e.g., `post1`, `post2`).
- `<dev_l>` and `<dev_n>` represent dev labels and numbers (e.g., `dev1`, `dev2`).
- `<local>` represents local version labels (e.g., `+abc`).

Given the output is `Version('1.11.3')`, the input string must be `'1.11.3'` because it fits the release format without any pre-release, post-release, dev, or local components.

Therefore, the input to the `parse` function is the string `'1.11.3'`.
