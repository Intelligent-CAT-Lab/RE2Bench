The input structure has a placeholder for `_elements` under `nargs`. Since the method `_eval_is_real` checks if the argument is real, and the output is `True`, the input to the method must be a real number. The simplest real number is 0, which is represented in SymPy as `S.Zero`. Therefore, the argument `self` is an instance of `sinh` with the argument 0. So, `_elements` should be `[0]`.
