To predict the input for the `check_in` method given the output, let's analyze the provided output and method structure step by step:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output given is `null`, indicating that the `check_in` method did not return any value or `None`.

2. **Analyzing the Method Structure**: The `check_in` method of the `Hotel` class checks if a room can be booked for a guest. It first checks if the room type exists in `booked_rooms`. If not, it returns `False`. Then, it checks if the guest (by name) has a booking and compares the room number to be booked with the existing booking.

3. **Possible Scenarios Leading to `null` Output**:
   - The room type does not exist in `booked_rooms`, leading to an immediate return of `False`.
   - The guest's existing booking has a room number less than the one being checked in, which also leads to a return of `False`.

Given these scenarios and the structure of the input, we need to deduce values for `room_type`, `room_number`, and `name` that would result in the method returning `null` (`False` in this context, considering the method's implementation).

Let's consider a scenario where the room type exists but the guest doesn't have a booking or the room number comparison leads to a `False` return:

- **Scenario**: Assume "double" rooms are available but not booked yet (or not in `booked_rooms`), and there's an attempt to book a double room.

Given the constraints and aiming for a `null` output, we can construct an input that fits the method's behavior:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "name": "Example Hotel",
        "available_rooms": {
            "single": 10,
            "double": 5
        },
        "booked_rooms": {
            "single": {}
        }
    },
    "args": {
        "room_type": "double",
        "room_number": 2,
        "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

This input assumes "double" rooms are available but attempts to book a room type that might not be properly initialized in `booked_rooms` or leads to a condition where the method returns `False` (interpreted as `null` in the context of this exercise), thus fitting the given output scenario.
