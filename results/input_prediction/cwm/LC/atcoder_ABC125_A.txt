The output is given as 1, and the code computes this as `ans = T // A * B`. We need to find the values of A, B, and T that would make this equation equal to 1. 

First, let's analyze the equation `ans = T // A * B`. The output is the integer division of T by A, then multiplied by B. For this result to be 1, the integer division `T // A` must be 1 (since any other number multiplied by B would not result in 1 unless B is a fraction, but A, B, and T are integers). Therefore, `T // A = 1` and `B` must be 1. 

If `T // A = 1`, then A must be greater than or equal to T, but less than 2*T (since the division result is 1). Also, T must be a multiple of A or at least A should be a divisor of T for the division to result in an integer. However, since we only care about the quotient being 1, the simplest case is when T equals A. 

Given these constraints, let's assume A equals T. Then, B must be 1 for the product to be 1. Therefore, the input values could be A = 1, B = 1, and T = 1. 

So, the input would be "1 1 1".
