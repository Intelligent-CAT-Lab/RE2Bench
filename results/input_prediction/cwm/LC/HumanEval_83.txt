Let's analyze the given output and function to determine the input.

The output is 18000, and the function is:

def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)

We need to find the value of `n` that results in the output 18000.

Let's consider the case when `n != 1`, which is likely since the output is large:

return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2) = 18000

Divide both sides by 18:

10 ** (n - 2) = 1000

Take the logarithm base 10 of both sides:

n - 2 = 3

Add 2 to both sides:

n = 5

So, the input to the function should be `n = 5`.
