The function `f` takes two arguments, `array` and `index`, and returns the element at the specified `index` in the `array`. If the `index` is negative, it is adjusted to correspond to the end of the array by adding the length of the array to the index.

Given that the output is 1, we need to find the possible values of `array` and `index` that would result in this output.

There are a few possibilities:

1. The `array` is `[1]` and `index` is 0.
2. The `array` is `[0, 1]` and `index` is 1.
3. The `array` is `[1, 2]` and `index` is 0.
4. The `array` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `index` is 1.
5. The `array` is `[1]` and `index` is -1.

Let's consider the last possibility. If `array` is `[1]` and `index` is -1, then the function would adjust the index to `len(array) + index = 1 + (-1) = 0`, and return `array[0] = 1`.

This is a valid possibility, and it's the simplest one. Therefore, the input of `f` would be:
