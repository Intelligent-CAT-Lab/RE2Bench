Let's think step-by-step about this problem.

The function `make_a_pile(n)` returns a list where each element is calculated using the formula `n + 2 * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This means the list will contain `n` elements.

Given the output:
```
[3, 5, 7]
```
We can see that this list has 3 elements. According to the formula, if `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, then `n` must be equal to the number of elements in the list. Therefore, `n` must be 3.

Let's verify this by plugging `n=3` into the formula:
- For `i=0`, the element is `3 + 2*0 = 3`.
- For `i=1`, the element is `3 + 2*1 = 5`.
- For `i=2`, the element is `3 + 2*2 = 7`.

This matches the given output perfectly. Therefore, the input to the function `make_a_pile` must be `n=3`.
