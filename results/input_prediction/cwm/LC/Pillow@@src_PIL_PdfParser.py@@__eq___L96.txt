To get the output `false`, the `__eq__` method must return `False`. This happens when at least one of the conditions in the return statement is not met. Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `other.__class__ is self.__class__`: This checks if `other` is of the same class as `self`. If `other` is not an instance of `IndirectReference`, this condition fails.
2. `other.object_id == self.object_id`: This checks if the `object_id` attributes of `self` and `other` are equal. If they are not, this condition fails.
3. `other.generation == self.generation`: This checks if the `generation` attributes of `self` and `other` are equal. If they are not, this condition fails.

Since the output is `False`, at least one of these conditions must be `False`. Given that we don't have information about `self`'s attributes, the most straightforward way to ensure `False` is returned is to have `other` be of a different class than `IndirectReference`. This way, the first condition fails, and the method returns `False` without evaluating the other conditions.

Therefore, the input `other` should be an instance of a different class.
