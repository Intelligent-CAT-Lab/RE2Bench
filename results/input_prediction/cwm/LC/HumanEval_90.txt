To determine the input of the `next_smallest` function given the output, let's break down the function's logic:

1. The function takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It converts the list into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts the resulting set in ascending order.
3. If the length of the sorted set is less than 2, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second element of the sorted set (since list indices start at 0, `lst[1]` is the second smallest element).

Given the output is `2`, this means the second smallest element in the sorted, deduplicated list is `2`.

To have `2` as the second smallest element, the smallest element must be less than `2`, and there must be no elements between the smallest element and `2`. The most straightforward scenario is that the list contains `1` and `2`, and possibly other numbers greater than `2`, but since we're only concerned with the second smallest element, numbers greater than `2` do not affect the outcome.

Therefore, a minimal input that would produce the output `2` is a list containing at least `1` and `2`.
