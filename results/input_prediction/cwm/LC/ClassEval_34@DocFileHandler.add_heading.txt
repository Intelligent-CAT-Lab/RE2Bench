The output is True, which means the heading was successfully added to the document. This implies that the file path is valid, and the document exists. Let's think about a typical scenario where this method would be called. The file_path should point to a .docx file that exists in the filesystem. The heading could be any string, but since the output is True, the method must have executed without errors.

A common use case might involve adding a heading like "Introduction" or "Chapter 1" to a document. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the heading is "Introduction". The file_path could be a path to a test document, such as "test_document.docx".

Therefore, the input to the add_heading method would be a file path pointing to an existing .docx file and a heading string.
