Let's think step by step. The function `convert_to_ascii` takes a binary string and converts it into ASCII characters. The output is "hebo". So, we need to find out what binary string would result in "hebo".

First, let's look at the ASCII values of the characters in "hebo":
- 'h' has an ASCII value of 104
- 'e' has an ASCII value of 101
- 'b' has an ASCII value of 98
- 'o' has an ASCII value of 111

Now, let's convert these decimal values to binary:
- 104 in binary is 01101000
- 101 in binary is 01100101
- 98 in binary is 01100010
- 111 in binary is 01101111

So, the binary string should be the concatenation of these binary numbers: 01101000011001010110001001101111.

However, we need to ensure that each character is represented by 8 bits (1 byte), which they are in this case. 

Therefore, the input to the `convert_to_ascii` function should be a `BinaryDataProcessor` instance with the `binary_string` attribute set to "01101000011001010110001001101111".
