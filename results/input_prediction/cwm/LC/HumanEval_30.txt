Let's think step by step. The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` and returns a new list containing only the elements that are greater than 0. The output given is `[4, 5, 6]`. 

This means the original list must have included these numbers, along with possibly other non-positive numbers that were filtered out. Since the output only contains positive numbers, the input list could be something like `[4, 5, 6]` or `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` or any other list where these three numbers are present along with other non-positive numbers (like 0, -1, -2, etc.).

However, without more specific information about the original list, the most straightforward assumption is that the input list was exactly `[4, 5, 6]` because there's no indication of other elements being present. 

Therefore, the input to the function `get_positive` should be a list containing the numbers 4, 5, and 6.
