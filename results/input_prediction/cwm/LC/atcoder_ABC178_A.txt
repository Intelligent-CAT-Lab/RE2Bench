We are given a Python script that reads an integer input and prints 0 if the input is 1, otherwise it prints 1. The output provided is 0. Let's work through the logic to determine the input.

1. The script starts by reading an integer from the input and storing it in the variable `x`.
2. It then checks if `x` is equal to 1.
3. If `x` is 1, it prints 0.
4. If `x` is not 1, it prints 1.

Given that the output is 0, we know that the condition `x == 1` must have been true. Therefore, the input `x` must be 1.
