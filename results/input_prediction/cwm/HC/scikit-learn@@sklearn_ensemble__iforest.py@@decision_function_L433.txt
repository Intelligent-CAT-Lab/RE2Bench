To predict the input of `decision_function`, I need to understand what `decision_function` does and how it relates to the given output. 

1. **Understanding `decision_function`:**  
   The `decision_function` method returns the anomaly scores of input samples. It calculates these scores by subtracting `self.offset_` from the result of `self.score_samples(X)`.

2. **Given Output Analysis:**  
   The output is `[0., 0.]`, indicating that the decision function returned an array of two zeros. This suggests that the anomaly scores of the input samples were equal to `self.offset_`.

3. **Relating to `score_samples`:**  
   The `score_samples` method computes the anomaly scores. The output of `score_samples` is subtracted by `self.offset_` to get the decision function's output. Since the result is `[0., 0.]`, it implies that `score_samples(X)` returned `[self.offset_, self.offset_]`.

4. **Implications for Input:**  
   - `X` must be an array where each sample has the same anomaly score, leading to the subtraction resulting in zero.
   - `self.offset_` is a parameter that depends on the contamination level and the scores from the training data. For the output to be zero, `self.score_samples(X)` must exactly match `self.offset_`.

5. **Constructing the Input:**  
   - `self` must be an instance of `IsolationForest` with specific parameters, including `offset_` set appropriately.
   - `X` is likely a 2D array (or similar structure) with two samples, each resulting in the same score when passed through `score_samples`.

Given these considerations, I will construct a plausible input structure that satisfies the conditions.
