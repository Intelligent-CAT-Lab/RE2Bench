To determine the input of the `_print_Pow` method given the output "sqrt(2)", we need to analyze the provided code and the output.

The `_print_Pow` method is responsible for printing power expressions in a specific format. The output "sqrt(2)" suggests that the expression being printed is the square root of 2, which can be represented as 2^(1/2) or 2**Rational(1, 2) in Sympy.

Looking at the code, we see that if the exponent is S.Half (which represents 1/2), it returns 'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base). This means the base of the power expression must be 2.

Given this information, we can deduce the following:

1. The `expr` argument must be a power expression with base 2 and exponent 1/2.
2. The `rational` argument is set to False because the output is "sqrt(2)" instead of a rational representation.
3. The `self` object is an instance of `StrPrinter` with default settings.

Here is the predicted input:
