1. The `fit` method is called with several parameters initialized in the `__init__` method, so the `self` object contains these default values. We need to identify these defaults from the output.
2. The output shows `n_iter` as 300, `tol` as 0.001, `alpha_1` and `alpha_2` as 1e-06, `lambda_1` and `lambda_2` as 1e-06, `compute_score` as true, `fit_intercept` as true, `normalize` as false, `copy_X` as true, and `verbose` as false. These are all default parameters from `__init__`.
3. The `alpha_init` and `lambda_init` are not provided in the output but are initialized as `None` by default.
4. The `X_offset_` is "[2.88235294 4.11764706]" and `X_scale_` is "[1. 1.]", which suggests that the data was not normalized (`normalize=False`).
5. The `scores_` array indicates that `compute_score` is `True`.
6. The `n_iter_` is 13, which is less than the default `n_iter` of 300, suggesting the model converged early.
7. The `alpha_` and `lambda_` values are 0.1746710127333762 and 2014.1293106460896, respectively, which are updated during the fitting process.
8. The `coef_` is "[0.00147976 0.00186202]" and `sigma_` is a 2x2 matrix, indicating the model was fitted on 2 features.
9. The `intercept_` is 2.576302957347, which is calculated based on the data.

To reconstruct the input, we need to infer the original `X` and `y` data. Since the `X_offset_` is [2.88235294 4.11764706], and assuming the data was not normalized, the original `X` might have been centered around these values. However, without the actual data points, we can't determine the exact `X` and `y`. But we can infer the structure based on the output.

Given the `X_offset_` and `X_scale_`, and knowing that `fit_intercept` is `True`, we can assume that the original `X` had two features. The `y` values would have been centered around the `intercept_` value.

Since the problem asks for the input structure with placeholders for `X` and `y`, we'll fill in the known parameters and leave `X` and `y` as placeholders.
