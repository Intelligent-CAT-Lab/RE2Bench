To solve this, let's analyze the function step by step.

The output of `is_valid_backend` is `True`, which means the provided backend is valid according to the function's logic. Let's consider possible scenarios that could lead to this result.

1. **Backend is in BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK or _backend_to_gui_framework**:
   - If the backend is already listed in the built-in mapping or in the dynamically loaded `_backend_to_gui_framework`, it returns `True` immediately without any further checks.

2. **Backend starts with "module://"**:
   - If the backend string starts with "module://", it is added to `_backend_to_gui_framework` with a value of 'unknown' and returns `True`.

3. **Entry points are loaded and the backend is found**:
   - If the backend isn't recognized initially, the function calls `_ensure_entry_points_loaded()`, which loads entry points from the environment. If the backend is found in the loaded entry points, it returns `True`.

Given that `_backend_to_gui_framework` is empty in the input structure, and the output is `True`, the most likely scenario is that the backend is either in the built-in list or starts with "module://".

Let's test some possibilities:

- **Case 1**: Backend is "gtk3agg" (a built-in backend).
  - The function checks if "gtk3agg" is in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` or `_backend_to_gui_framework`. Since it's in the built-in list, it returns `True`.

- **Case 2**: Backend is "module://some.module".
  - The function checks if it starts with "module://", adds it to `_backend_to_gui_framework`, and returns `True`.

Since the output is `True` and `_backend_to_gui_framework` is empty, the simplest explanation is that the backend is a built-in one. Let's choose "gtk3agg" as the backend for this example.
