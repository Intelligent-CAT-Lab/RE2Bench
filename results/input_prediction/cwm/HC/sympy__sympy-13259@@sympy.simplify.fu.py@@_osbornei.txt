1. The function `_osbornei` appears to convert trigonometric functions into hyperbolic functions using the identity `sin(x) -> sinh(x)/I`, `cos(x) -> cosh(x)`, etc.
2. The output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)` suggests that the input trigonometric function was converted using this identity.
3. Given the structure of the output, the input `e` must be a trigonometric function (e.g., `tan`) with an argument that, when expanded, would produce `x + I*z`.
4. The argument `x + I*z` is equivalent to `tan(x + I*z)`, which would convert to `tanh(x + I*z)/I`. Multiplying by `-I` would yield `-I*tanh(x + I*z)`, matching the output.
5. Therefore, the input `e` is likely `tan(x + I*z)`.
6. The `d` parameter in `_osbornei(e, d)` seems to be a dummy variable or placeholder. Since it's not used in the output, it's probably irrelevant for this specific case.
