Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have the output of the `_euclidean_distances_upcast` function, which computes the pairwise Euclidean distances between two sets of points. The output is a 10x20 matrix, meaning there are 10 points in set X and 20 points in set Y (or the same set, depending on the input).

The function's parameters are:
- X: The first set of points.
- XX: Precomputed squared norms of X (optional).
- Y: The second set of points (could be the same as X).
- YY: Precomputed squared norms of Y (optional).

Given the output, we need to find the input values for X, XX, Y, and YY.

First, let's consider the shape of the output. The output is a 10x20 matrix, so X has 10 samples, and Y has 20 samples. Each sample is a point in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features.

Since the function computes Euclidean distances, the number of features (n) must be the same for both X and Y.

To find the input values, we can work backwards from the output. However, without more information about the specific values in X and Y, it's challenging to determine the exact input. But we can make some educated guesses based on the structure of the function.

1. X and Y are likely numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices, given the use of `np.empty`, `issparse`, and `safe_sparse_dot` in the function.
2. XX and YY are optional precomputed squared norms of X and Y, respectively. If not provided, the function computes them using `row_norms`.

Given the output, let's assume that X and Y are numpy arrays with 10 and 20 samples, respectively, and an unknown number of features (n). The exact values of X and Y would depend on the specific distances calculated, but we can represent them as arrays with the correct shape.

For simplicity, let's assume that XX and YY are not provided (i.e., they are None), so the function computes the squared norms internally.

Now, let's construct the input based on these assumptions.
