We have a function `multinomial_coefficients(m, n)` that generates a dictionary of multinomial coefficients. The output given is:

```
{
    "(2, 0, 0, 0)": 1,
    "(1, 1, 0, 0)": 2,
    "(0, 2, 0, 0)": 1,
    "(1, 0, 1, 0)": 2,
    "(0, 1, 1, 0)": 2,
    "(0, 0, 2, 0)": 1,
    "(1, 0, 0, 1)": 2,
    "(0, 1, 0, 1)": 2,
    "(0, 0, 1, 1)": 2,
    "(0, 0, 0, 2)": 1
}
```

Each key in the output dictionary represents a tuple of exponents that sum up to `n`, and the value is the multinomial coefficient for that tuple.

Looking at the keys, we can see that the maximum exponent in any tuple is 2, and the sum of exponents in each tuple is 2. This suggests that `n` is 2.

The length of each tuple is 4, which suggests that `m` is 4. This is because in multinomial coefficients, `m` is the number of different categories or outcomes, and `n` is the total number of items to distribute among these categories.

Therefore, the input to the function `multinomial_coefficients` should be `m=4` and `n=2`.
