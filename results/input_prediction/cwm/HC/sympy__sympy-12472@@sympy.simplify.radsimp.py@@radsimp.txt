Step 1: The function `radsimp` takes an expression `expr` and simplifies its radical form. The output given is "1/(a - b)", which suggests that the input expression is likely "1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))" or an equivalent form.

Step 2: To simplify "1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))", we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is "(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))". This process results in the expression "1/(a - b)" after simplification.

Step 3: Considering the `radsimp` function's purpose and the given output, the input `expr` should be "1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))".

Step 4: The keyword arguments `symbolic` and `max_terms` are optional. Since they are not provided in the output, we can assume their default values are used. The default value for `symbolic` is `True`, and for `max_terms` it is `4`.

Step 5: Therefore, the input to the `radsimp` function should be:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "expr": "1/(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))"
    },
    "kwargs": {
        "symbolic": true,
        "max_terms": 4
    }
}
```
