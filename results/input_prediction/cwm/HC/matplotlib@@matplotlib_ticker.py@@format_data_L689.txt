First, let's analyze the given output "1.1e-1" from the `format_data` method. This suggests that the value passed to `format_data` is 0.11 because:

- The significand (rounded value) is 1.1.
- The exponent is -1, indicating the value is 1.1 * 10^-1 = 0.11.

Next, we need to determine the settings of the `ScalarFormatter` object. The output format "1.1e-1" indicates that the formatter is using scientific notation. This depends on the `_useMathText`, `_usetex`, and `_useLocale` properties.

- If `_useMathText` or `_usetex` is True, the output would use LaTeX-style formatting (e.g., "1.1 \\times 10^{-1}"). Since the output is "1.1e-1", these must be False.
- `_useLocale` might affect the formatting of numbers, but since the output is in a standard scientific notation without locale-specific formatting, it's likely False or not affecting the result here.

The `offset` and `_useOffset` properties might influence the formatting, but since the output is a straightforward scientific notation, they likely don't impact this specific case.

Given these considerations, the input to `format_data` should be a value of 0.11. The `self` object's properties should be set such that scientific notation is used without LaTeX or locale-specific formatting.
