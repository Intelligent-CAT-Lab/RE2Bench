First, analyze the given output. The function `split_super_sub` returns a tuple of (name, supers, subs). The output provided is ["Fvec", null, null]. This means that the name part is "Fvec", and there are no superscripts or subscripts.

Looking at the code, the function splits the input text into name, superscripts, and subscripts based on certain patterns. If the input text is "Fvec", then the name will be "Fvec" and there will be no superscripts or subscripts. 

Now, let's consider the structure of the input. The input to the function `split_super_sub` is a string `text`. The structure provided is a JSON object with `self`, `args`, and `kwargs`. The `args` contain the `text` which we need to predict.

Given the output, the input text should be "Fvec" because it matches the name part of the output. There are no superscripts or subscripts in the output, so the input text should not contain any characters that would be interpreted as superscripts or subscripts.

Therefore, the predicted input is a JSON object where the `text` in `args` is "Fvec".
