1. The output of `resolve_backend` is a tuple where the second element is `null`. This indicates that the gui framework is 'headless'.
2. The backend is likely 'agg' or another backend that maps to 'headless'.
3. The self object has `_loaded_entry_points` set to False because `_ensure_entry_points_loaded` is called when gui is None and `_loaded_entry_points` is False. Since gui is not 'unknown' but rather 'headless', this implies that the backend was found in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`.
4. Therefore, the backend must be one of the keys in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` that maps to 'headless', such as 'agg', 'cairo', 'pdf', 'pgf', 'ps', 'svg', or 'template'.
5. Given that the output backend is 'agg', I'll choose 'agg' as the backend.

Now, let's construct the input based on this reasoning.
