Let's break this down step by step.

We are given the output of the `euclidean_distances` function as a 2D array `[[1.1649954]]`, which suggests that the Euclidean distance between two points is approximately 1.1649954. We need to find the input parameters `X` and `Y` that would produce this output.

First, let's recall that the Euclidean distance between two vectors `x` and `y` is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences of their corresponding elements. Mathematically, this is:

```
distance = sqrt(Σ(x_i - y_i)^2)
```

Given the output `[[1.1649954]]`, we can infer that the input vectors `X` and `Y` are such that their squared differences sum up to `(1.1649954)^2 ≈ 1.35585`.

Let's consider possible simple cases where `X` and `Y` could be 1D arrays (i.e., single points in n-dimensional space) or 2D arrays (multiple points).

Case 1: Both `X` and `Y` are 1D arrays (single points).
In this case, the distance between `X` and `Y` would be a single value. However, the output is a 2D array `[[1.1649954]]`, suggesting that `X` and `Y` might be 2D arrays with one row each.

Case 2: `X` and `Y` are 2D arrays with one row each (i.e., single points in n-dimensional space).
Let's assume `X` is a 2D array with shape `(1, n)` and `Y` is also a 2D array with shape `(1, n)`. The Euclidean distance between these two points would be a single value, but the output is a 2D array `[[1.1649954]]`, which fits this scenario.

Now, let's find specific values for `X` and `Y` that would result in this distance. Let's consider a simple case where `X` and `Y` are 1D arrays (or 2D arrays with one row) with two elements each.

Suppose `X = [[a, b]]` and `Y = [[c, d]]`. The Euclidean distance between `X` and `Y` would be:

```
distance = sqrt((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2) = 1.1649954
```

Squaring both sides:

```
(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 ≈ 1.35585
```

One possible solution is `a - c = 1` and `b - d = 0`, which gives:

```
(1)^2 + (0)^2 = 1 ≈ 1.35585 (not exact, but close)
```

However, this doesn't exactly match the given output. Let's try another approach.

Another possible solution is `a - c = 0.5` and `b - d = 1`, which gives:

```
(0.5)^2 + (1)^2 = 0.25 + 1 = 1.25 ≈ 1.35585 (still not exact)
```

It seems that the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` might not be integers or simple fractions. Let's consider another approach.

Since the output is `[[1.1649954]]`, which is approximately `sqrt(1.35585)`, let's look for a combination of differences that sum up to approximately 1.35585.

One possible combination is `a - c = 1` and `b - d = 0.5`, which gives:

```
(1)^2 + (0.5)^2 = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25 ≈ 1.35585 (still not exact)
```

Another possible combination is `a - c = 0.8` and `b - d = 0.8`, which gives:

```
(0.8)^2 + (0.8)^2 = 0.64 + 0.64 = 1.28 ≈ 1.35585 (still not exact)
```

It seems that the exact values might be more complex. However, based on the given output, we can make an educated guess.

Let's assume that `X` and `Y` are 2D arrays with one row each, and the difference between the corresponding elements is such that the sum of the squared differences is approximately 1.35585.

One possible solution is:

```
X = [[0, 0]]
Y = [[1, 1]]
```

In this case, the Euclidean distance between `X` and `Y` would be:

```
distance = sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356
```

This is close to the given output but not exact. However, it's possible that the exact values of `X` and `Y` are slightly different.

Another possible solution is:

```
X = [[0, 0]]
Y = [[1, 0.5]]
```

In this case, the Euclidean distance between `X` and `Y` would be:

```
distance = sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.25) ≈ 1.11803399
```

This is not close to the given output.

Let's try another approach. Since the output is `[[1.1649954]]`, which is approximately `sqrt(1.35585)`, let's look for a combination of differences that sum up to approximately 1.35585.

One possible combination is `a - c = 1` and `b - d = 0.3`, which gives:

```
(1)^2 + (0.3)^2 = 1 + 0.09 = 1.09 ≈ 1.35585 (not exact)
```

Another possible combination is `a - c = 0.9` and `b - d = 0.9`, which gives:

```
(0.9)^2 + (0.9)^2 = 0.81 + 0.81 = 1.62 ≈ 1.35585 (not exact)
