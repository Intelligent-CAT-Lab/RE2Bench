To find the input of `orthogonal_mp_gram`, given the output, I will simulate the execution of the function step by step.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is `[0.         2.33249979 0.         0.         0.         0.        0.         0.         0.         0.         0.         0.        ]`. This is a 1D array of length 12, which is likely the result of the `orthogonal_mp_gram` function.

2. **Analyzing the Function**: The `orthogonal_mp_gram` function performs Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) on a Gram matrix `Gram` and a target `Xy`. It finds a sparse representation of `Xy` in terms of the columns of `Gram`.

3. **Determining the Dimensions**: Since the output array has length 12, we can infer that the number of samples (n_samples) in `Xy` is 12. The number of features (n_features) in `Gram` must be at least 12.

4. **Choosing Xy**: The second element of the output array is non-zero (2.33249979), indicating that the second sample in `Xy` has a non-zero coefficient. For simplicity, let's assume `Xy` is a vector where only the second element is non-zero.

5. **Selecting Gram**: The `Gram` matrix should be such that the second column (corresponding to the non-zero element in `Xy`) has a significant value, while the others are smaller or zero. This will ensure that the OMP algorithm selects the second column as the significant feature.

6. **Setting Other Parameters**: 
   - `n_nonzero_coefs` is set to 1, indicating we want to find a single non-zero coefficient.
   - `tol` is not provided, so we set it to `None`.
   - `norms_squared` is not provided, so we set it to `None`.
   - `copy_Xy` is set to `True` to ensure `Xy` is copied if necessary.

7. **Constructing the Input**:
   - `Gram` is a square matrix with dimensions (n_features, n_features). Let's choose `n_features = 12` for simplicity.
   - `Xy` is a 1D array of length 12, with only the second element being non-zero.

Given these considerations, the input to `orthogonal_mp_gram` can be constructed as follows:
