1. The output is a 2x4 matrix. This suggests that the original matrix had 2 rows, and the other matrix added 2 columns.
2. The matrix entries are [1, 0, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 0, 1], indicating that the original matrix was [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (identity matrix) and the other matrix was [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (another identity matrix).
3. Since `row_join` concatenates matrices horizontally, the original matrix must have been a 2x2 identity matrix, and the other matrix is also a 2x2 identity matrix.
