The output given is a list of datetime strings. Let's break down what's needed to generate such an output from the `decode_cf_datetime` function.

1. **Understanding the function**: The function `decode_cf_datetime` converts numerical dates into datetime objects based on given units and a calendar. It can use either pandas or cftime for decoding, depending on the input parameters.

2. **Analyzing the output**: The output datetime strings are in the format '1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000', indicating they are in a standard Gregorian calendar format with microsecond precision. The years are 1681, which is within the range that pandas can handle (unlike cftime, which might be used for out-of-range dates).

3. **Determining the input parameters**:
   - `num_dates`: These are the numerical values representing the dates. Given the output, these numbers are likely hour offsets from a reference date.
   - `units`: The units of the numerical dates. Since the output times are spaced by one hour, the units are probably 'hours since [reference date]'.
   - `calendar`: The calendar used. Since the output is in a standard Gregorian format, the calendar is likely 'standard' or 'gregorian'.

4. **Reference date calculation**: To get the specific datetime strings, we need to determine the reference date. Given that the first datetime string is '1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000', if we assume the numerical dates start at 0, the reference date would be this datetime minus the numerical date value times the unit. However, without the exact numerical dates, we can infer the units and reference date format.

5. **Possible input**: 
   - `num_dates` could be an array of numbers like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] representing hours since a reference date.
   - `units` would be 'hours since 1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000' to match the output datetime strings.
   - `calendar` is 'standard' or 'gregorian'.

6. **Conclusion**: The input to `decode_cf_datetime` would involve these numerical dates, units, and the calendar. However, the exact numerical dates array isn't provided, so we'll assume a simple array based on the output spacing (hourly increments).
