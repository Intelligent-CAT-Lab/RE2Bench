To determine the input of `_eval_expand_mul`, let's analyze the output and the function's behavior. The output is `-sin(phi)**2`, which suggests that the function processed an expression involving trigonometric functions and expanded it.

1. **Output Analysis**: The output `-sin(phi)**2` indicates that the input expression might have been something like `-sin(phi)**2`. However, the function `_eval_expand_mul` is designed to expand products, especially when they involve sums. Since the output doesn't show an expansion of a product into a sum, we need to consider what the function does in such cases.

2. **Function Behavior**: The `_eval_expand_mul` method checks if the expression can be simplified by expanding sums within the multiplication. If there are no sums to expand, it returns the expression as is. Given that the output is a simple expression without any expansion, it's likely that the input was already in a form that didn't require expansion.

3. **Input Structure**: The input structure provided includes `self`, `args`, and `kwargs`. The `self` parameter would be an instance of a class that uses `_eval_expand_mul`, likely a `Mul` or similar expression object. The `args` are empty, suggesting no positional arguments are passed beyond `self`. The `kwargs` include several hints like `power_base`, `power_exp`, `mul`, `log`, `multinomial`, and `basic`, which are used to guide the expansion process.

4. **Determining `self`**: Since the output is `-sin(phi)**2`, `self` must represent this expression. In SymPy, expressions like `-sin(phi)**2` are instances of `Mul` or `Pow` classes. However, given the output, it's more likely that `self` is a `Mul` object representing the product of `-1` and `sin(phi)**2`.

5. **kwargs Analysis**: The `kwargs` provide hints for how to handle different parts of the expression. Since the output doesn't involve powers, logs, multinomials, or basic expansions beyond what's already shown, most of these hints might be `False` or not relevant. The `power_base` and `power_exp` hints could be relevant if the function is handling powers within the multiplication, but since the output is a simple power, these might not be necessary.

Given these considerations, the input to `_eval_expand_mul` would likely involve an expression that, when processed, results in `-sin(phi)**2` without needing further expansion. This suggests that the input expression was already in a simplified form or that the expansion hints did not trigger any changes.
