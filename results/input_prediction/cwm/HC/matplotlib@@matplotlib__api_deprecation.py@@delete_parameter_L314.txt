To determine the input of `delete_parameter`, we need to analyze the given output and understand how the `delete_parameter` function operates. 

The `delete_parameter` function is a decorator factory that takes parameters `since`, `name`, and optionally `func`, and returns a decorator that deprecates the parameter `name` in the function `func` since version `since`.

Given the output is a function object `<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>`, this implies that `func` in the input of `delete_parameter` is this function. However, to fully specify the input, we need to understand the context of `since` and `name`.

The function `delete_parameter` is used to deprecate parameters in functions. The output indicates that the decorated function is `func2`, but without additional context, the exact values of `since` and `name` are ambiguous. However, we can infer the structure of the input based on the function's purpose.

The input structure is defined as:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "since": XXX,
        "name": XXX,
        "func": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

To fill in the placeholders (`XXX`), we need specific information about the version (`since`) and the parameter name (`name`) that are being deprecated in `func2`. Without this information, we can only provide a generic structure.

However, since the task involves predicting the input based on the output and maintaining the structure, we'll proceed with a hypothetical scenario where `since` could be a version string (e.g., "3.5") and `name` could be a parameter name (e.g., "parameter_name"), and `func` is the function `func2`.

Here's a hypothetical input based on this analysis:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "since": "3.5",
        "name": "parameter_name",
        "func": "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

This prediction assumes hypothetical values for `since` and `name` since the exact values are not provided in the problem statement. In a real-world scenario, these values would be known based on the specific use case of `delete_parameter` with `func2`.
