The output of the `fit` function is a NumPy array of change points. Given the output "[ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]", which seems to be a list of change points, I need to infer the input values for `t`, `x`, and `sigma` that would result in this output.

Looking at the structure of the input, I notice that `self` has attributes `p0`, `gamma`, and `ncp_prior`, but these are not directly used in the calculation of change points. The main inputs are `t`, `x`, and `sigma`.

Since the output is a list of change points, I can infer that the input `t` is likely a time series, `x` is the data, and `sigma` is the standard deviation of the data.

However, without more information about the specific data and the function's behavior, it's challenging to determine the exact input values. But I can make an educated guess based on the output.

Assuming that the change points are evenly spaced, I can infer that the input `t` might be a sequence of numbers representing time points. The output change points seem to be around 4.36, 48.46, 52.59, and 99.45. These values could correspond to specific time points in the input `t`.

Similarly, the input `x` might be a sequence of data values, and `sigma` could be the standard deviation of these data values.

Given the output, I can try to reconstruct the input values. However, this is a complex task, and there might be multiple possible inputs that could result in the same output.

But based on the information provided, I can make a reasonable guess for the input values.
