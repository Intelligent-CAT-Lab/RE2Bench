To predict the input of the `__call__` method given the output `{"score": -Infinity}`, we need to trace the execution path of the code. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the `__call__` Method**: The `__call__` method in the `_MultimetricScorer` class is responsible for evaluating the score of an estimator using one or more scorers. The output suggests that one of the scores is `-Infinity`, which typically occurs when a scorer encounters an error, and the `_raise_exc` flag is set to `False`.

2. **Analyzing the Error Handling**: In the `__call__` method, if an exception occurs during the scoring process and `_raise_exc` is `False`, the score is set to the string representation of the exception using `format_exc()`.

3. **Identifying the Scorer**: Given that the output is `{"score": -Infinity}`, it suggests that there is only one scorer named "score". The `-Infinity` value implies an error occurred during scoring, and since `_raise_exc` is likely `False`, the error message is formatted as a string but represented here as `-Infinity`.

4. **Determining `_raise_exc`**: Since the output does not raise an exception but instead returns `-Infinity`, we infer that `_raise_exc` must be `False`. This allows the method to catch exceptions and continue, storing the error as a string in the scores dictionary.

5. **Estimator and Arguments**: The exact values of the estimator and additional arguments (`args`) are not directly derivable from the output. However, we know the estimator must be an object that can be scored (e.g., a classifier or regressor), and `args` would typically include the test data (`X`) and true labels (`y_true`).

6. **Constructing the Input**: Based on the structure provided, we fill in the placeholders with the inferred values. The `_scorers` dictionary contains a single scorer named "score", which we'll represent as a placeholder since its exact type isn't specified. The `estimator` and `args` are also placeholders, as their specific values aren't determinable from the output alone.

Given these considerations, the predicted input would look like the following:
