Let's go through the execution step by step.

1. The function `get_stretch` is called, and it simply returns the value of `self._stretch`.
2. The output of `get_stretch` is "normal", which means `self._stretch` must be "normal".
3. To set `self._stretch` to "normal", we need to look at the `set_stretch` method.
4. In the `set_stretch` method, if the provided `stretch` is in `stretch_dict`, it sets `self._stretch` to that value. If not, it tries to convert `stretch` to an integer and checks if it's between 0 and 1000.
5. Since "normal" is a valid stretch value (it's likely a key in `stretch_dict`), we can assume that `set_stretch` was called with "normal" as the argument.
6. However, we don't need to know the exact input to `set_stretch` because we already know that `self._stretch` is "normal".
7. The other attributes of `self` (`_family`, `_slant`, `_variant`, `_weight`, `_file`, `_size`, and `_math_fontfamily`) are not relevant to the output of `get_stretch`, so we can ignore them.

Therefore, the input to `get_stretch` is simply a `FontProperties` object with `_stretch` set to "normal". The other attributes can be anything, but for simplicity, we can set them to their default values or None.
