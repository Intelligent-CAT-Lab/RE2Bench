To determine the input of `_fmt_converter_call`, let's analyze the provided output and the function's logic.

The output is `__attr_converter_a(a)`. This string is generated by the `_fmt_converter_call` method, which constructs the call to a converter function based on whether the converter takes `self` or `field` parameters.

Given the output, we can deduce the following:

1. The converter does not take `self` or `field` because the output does not include these parameters.
2. The attribute name is `a` because `__attr_converter_a` is the global name generated for this attribute.
3. The value variable is `a` because it appears as the argument in the converter call.

Thus, the input to `_fmt_converter_call` must specify that the converter does not take `self` or `field`, and it must provide `attr_name` as `a` and `value_var` as `a`.

Given the structure of the input, we can infer that `self` would be an instance of `Converter` where `takes_self` and `takes_field` are both `False`.

Here's the input that would lead to the given output:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "takes_self": false,
        "takes_field": false
    },
    "args": {
        "attr_name": "a",
        "value_var": "a"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
