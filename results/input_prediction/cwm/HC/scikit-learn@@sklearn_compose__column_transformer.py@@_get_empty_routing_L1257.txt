The function `_get_empty_routing` creates an empty routing structure. It uses the `_iter` method to iterate over transformers and builds a dictionary of empty method calls. Given the output, we know there is a single transformer named "trans". To match the output, the input to `_get_empty_routing` must have a `self` object where the `transformers` list includes a transformer with the name "trans". Additionally, the `_remainder` attribute should not contribute any names to the routing since the output only shows "trans". Therefore, we can infer that the `remainder` is either "drop" or does not produce any additional names.
