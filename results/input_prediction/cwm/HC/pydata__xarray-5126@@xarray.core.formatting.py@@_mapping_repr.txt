We need to determine the input to the `_mapping_repr` function that results in the output "Attributes:\n    foo:      bar". Let's break down the problem:

1. The function `_mapping_repr` is called with a mapping (a dictionary-like object) containing key-value pairs.
2. The `mapping` argument includes a key "foo" with a value that, when processed by the `summarizer` function, results in "bar".
3. The `title` argument determines the title of the section, which in this case is "Attributes".
4. The `expand_option_name` is used to determine whether to expand the mapping or not. Since there's no indication that the mapping was truncated or expanded, we can assume it's the default behavior.
5. The `summarizer` function is `summarize_attr` because the output is from the "Attributes" section, and the `summarize_attr` function is used for summarizing attributes.

Given this information, we can deduce the input as follows:

- The `mapping` argument should be a dictionary with the key "foo" and a value that, when passed to `summarize_attr`, results in "bar".
- The `title` argument should be "Attributes".
- The `summarizer` function should be `summarize_attr`.
- The `expand_option_name` should be a value that allows the mapping to be displayed in its entirety, which we'll assume is "default".

However, since we don't have the actual code for `summarize_attr` and its behavior, we'll make an educated guess that the value for "foo" is simply "bar" because the output shows "foo:      bar".

Thus, the input should look like:
