Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We are given the output of the function `_eval_is_infinite`, which returns `False`. Our task is to find the input to this function that would produce this output.

The function `_eval_is_infinite` relies on the helper function `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`, which returns a tuple `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)`. The logic in `_eval_is_infinite` then uses this tuple to determine the return value.

Let's look at the logic in `_eval_is_infinite`:

```python
def _eval_is_infinite(self):
    seen_zero, seen_infinite = self._eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()
    if seen_infinite is True and seen_zero is False:
        return True
    elif seen_infinite is False:
        return False
    else:
        return None
```

Given that the output is `False`, this must mean that the condition `seen_infinite is False` is met. Therefore, `seen_infinite` must be `False`.

Now, let's consider what `seen_infinite` being `False` implies about the arguments of the `Mul` expression. The `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` function iterates over the arguments and checks their `is_zero` and `is_infinite` properties.

For `seen_infinite` to be `False`, none of the arguments can have `is_infinite` equal to `True`. However, some arguments might have `is_infinite` equal to `None`, indicating that it's unknown whether they are infinite. But in the case where `seen_infinite` is `False`, it means that either all arguments have `is_infinite` as `False` or some have `None` but no argument has `True`.

But since the output is `False`, we can infer that there is no argument with `is_infinite` as `True`, and at least one argument must have `is_infinite` as `False` (or all have `None` but that would lead to `seen_infinite` being `None`, not `False`).

However, the exact structure of the input `self` (which is an instance of `Mul`) is not directly provided. But based on the structure given in the problem statement, we need to fill in the `self` placeholder.

Since the output is `False`, the simplest case is that all arguments of the `Mul` expression have `is_infinite` as `False`. One possible scenario is that the `Mul` expression has no arguments (an empty product), but that's not typical. Another possibility is that the arguments are such that none of them are infinite.

But without more specific information about the arguments, we can consider a simple case where the `Mul` expression has no arguments, or the arguments are such that their `is_infinite` property is `False`.

However, the problem structure requires us to provide a valid input in the given structure. Let's assume that the `Mul` expression has no arguments, which would be an unusual but valid case. In this case, the `args` attribute of `self` would be an empty tuple.

Therefore, the input to `_eval_is_infinite` would be an instance of `Mul` with no arguments.
