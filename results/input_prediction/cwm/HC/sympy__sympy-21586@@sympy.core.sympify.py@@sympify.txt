To determine the input to the `sympify` function given the output `2500/pi`, we need to consider the steps the function takes to convert an input into a SymPy expression. 

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output `2500/pi` is a symbolic expression, suggesting that the input was a string representation of this expression or a numerical value that, when processed, results in this symbolic form.

2. **Analyzing Possible Inputs**: 
   - If the input is already a SymPy expression, `sympify` would return it as is. However, since the output is a string representation of a symbolic expression, this is less likely.
   - The input could be a string like `"2500/pi"`, which `sympify` would parse into the symbolic expression.
   - Another possibility is that the input is a numerical value that, when converted through certain transformations (like rationalization or XOR conversion), results in `2500/pi`. However, this seems less straightforward given the output.

3. **Considering the `strict` Parameter**: The `strict` parameter determines how `sympify` handles inputs that cannot be converted to SymPy expressions. If `strict=True`, it raises an error for unconvertible inputs. If `False`, it attempts various conversions. Given the output is a valid expression, `strict` is likely `False`.

4. **Predicting the Input**: The most straightforward input that would result in the output `2500/pi` is the string `"2500/pi"`. This string can be parsed by `sympify` into the symbolic expression `2500/pi`.

5. **Determining `strict`**: Since the output is a valid expression and not an error, `strict` must be `False` to allow `sympify` to attempt parsing the string into a SymPy expression.

Therefore, the input to `sympify` that results in the output `2500/pi` is likely the string `"2500/pi"` with `strict=False`.
