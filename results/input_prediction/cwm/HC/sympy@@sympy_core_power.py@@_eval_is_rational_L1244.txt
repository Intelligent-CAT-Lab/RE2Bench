Let's analyze the given information step by step.

The method `_eval_is_rational` is part of the `Pow` class, which represents a power expression in SymPy. The method checks if the power expression evaluates to a rational number. The output provided is `null`, indicating that the method did not determine the expression to be rational and returned `None`.

To predict the input, we need to understand the conditions under which `_eval_is_rational` returns `None`. Let's look at the key parts of the method:

1. If the exponent is an integer, the base is rational, and the base is not zero or the exponent is not negative, then it returns `True`.
2. Otherwise, it calls `self.func(*self.as_base_exp())` to get a simplified form of the expression.
3. If the simplified expression is not a `Pow` object, it checks if the simplified expression is rational.
4. If the simplified expression is still a `Pow` object, it checks the base and exponent again.

Given that the output is `null`, it means that none of the conditions for returning `True` or `False` were met. This could happen if:
- The exponent is not an integer.
- The base is not rational.
- The simplified expression is still a `Pow` object with conditions that do not lead to a definite `True` or `False`.

To create an input that leads to this outcome, we need an expression where the base is not rational or the exponent is not an integer, and the simplified form does not resolve to a rational number.

Let's consider a simple example: `Pow(x, 2)`, where `x` is a symbol (not rational). In this case:
- `self.exp.is_integer` is `True` (since 2 is an integer).
- `self.base.is_rational` is `False` (since `x` is a symbol, not a rational number).
- Therefore, the first condition fails, and it proceeds to simplify the expression.
- Since `x` is a symbol, `self.func(*self.as_base_exp())` would still be `Pow(x, 2)`, which is a `Pow` object.
- The method then checks if the base and exponent of the simplified expression meet certain conditions, but since `x` is not rational, it does not return `True` or `False`.

Thus, the input could be a `Pow` object with a non-rational base and an integer exponent.
