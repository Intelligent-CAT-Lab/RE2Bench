1. The output is a NumPy array with shape (2, 4), suggesting two samples with four features each. This implies that the input `X` should have the same number of samples (2) and some features that are transformed into four columns.
2. The `FeatureUnion` class is used to combine multiple transformers. The `transformer_list` parameter should contain transformers that, when applied to the input `X`, produce the four output columns.
3. The `_hstack` method is used to horizontally stack the transformed outputs, which means each transformer should produce a subset of the columns.
4. Given the output array [[1., 1., 1., 0.],[1., 1., 0., 1.]], possible transformers could be:
   - A `FunctionTransformer` that duplicates the first feature (producing columns 0 and 1).
   - Another `FunctionTransformer` that inverts the second feature (producing column 2).
   - A `FunctionTransformer` that creates a binary feature (0 or 1) based on the third feature (producing column 3).
5. The `transformer_list` should include these transformers with appropriate names.
6. The `n_jobs` parameter determines parallelization. For simplicity, set it to 1 (no parallelization).
7. The `transformer_weights` parameter is optional and can be set to `None` unless specific weights are required, which they aren't based on the output.
8. `verbose` and `verbose_feature_names_out` can be set to `False` unless verbose logging is needed, which it isn't based on the output.
9. The input `X` should be a 2D array with two samples and the necessary features to produce the output when transformed.
10. Based on the output, a possible `X` could be a 2D array with two features, where the first feature is duplicated, the second is inverted, and the third is transformed into a binary feature.
