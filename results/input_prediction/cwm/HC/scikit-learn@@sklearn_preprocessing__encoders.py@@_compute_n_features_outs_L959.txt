Let's break down the problem step by step. The output given is `{"output": [2]}`, and the function `_compute_n_features_outs` generates this output. 

The output is a list where each element corresponds to the number of features produced by one-hot encoding for a particular feature in `self.categories_`. Specifically, the code does:

```python
output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]
```

This means that `self.categories_` is a list of categories for each feature, and each element of `output` is the length of these categories. Since the output is `[2]`, it implies that there is only one feature, and it has 2 categories.

Next, the function checks if `_drop_idx_after_grouping` is not `None` and adjusts the output accordingly. However, since the output remains `[2]`, it suggests that either `_drop_idx_after_grouping` is `None` or the drop operation didn't change the count (e.g., no index was dropped).

Then, there's a check for `_infrequent_enabled`. If it's `True`, the function further adjusts the output by subtracting the number of infrequent categories. However, the output remains unchanged, indicating that either `_infrequent_enabled` is `False` or the adjustment didn't affect the count.

Putting this together, the key points are:
1. `self.categories_` is a list containing one element (since the output list has length 1), and that element has 2 categories.
2. `_drop_idx_after_grouping` is either `None` or didn't alter the count.
3. `_infrequent_enabled` is either `False` or the adjustment didn't change the count.

Now, let's construct the input based on this analysis.
