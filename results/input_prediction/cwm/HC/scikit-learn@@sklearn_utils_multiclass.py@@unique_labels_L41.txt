<think>
1. To get the output "[0, 1]", the input `ys` should be a tuple containing two NumPy arrays, each with binary labels (0 and 1).
2. The function `attach_unique` will check the unique values of `ys` and verify that the `unique` property exists. The `cached_unique` function (not shown) might precompute and cache these unique values during the execution.
3. Since the output is a sorted array [0, 1], the input data should contain binary labels 0 and 1.

Thus, the input `ys` is likely a tuple of two NumPy arrays, each containing [0, 1].
