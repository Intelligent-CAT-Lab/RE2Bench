First, I need to understand what the `_setup` method does. It sets up the scale for a continuous variable. The method takes in a Series `data`, a Property `prop`, and an optional Axis `axis`. 

Looking at the output, the `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are both not None. This suggests that the `tick()` and `label()` methods have been called on the instance before calling `_setup()`. Therefore, I should set `_tick_params` and `_label_params` to some default values that are not None.

The output shows that `_legend` is None, which implies that `prop.legend` is False. So, I should set `prop.legend` to False.

The `trans` attribute in the output is "log", which means the transformation applied to the data is a logarithmic transformation. Therefore, I should set `trans` to "log".

The `norm` attribute is None, which suggests that the data is not normalized. So, I should set `norm` to None.

The `values` attribute is also None, which might be a default value. I will set it to None.

Now, let's look at the `data` argument. The output does not provide much information about the data, but since the method is for continuous data, I will assume that the data is a Series with some continuous values. However, the exact values are not important for this problem, so I will set the data to a dummy Series.

The `prop` argument has a `variable` attribute, which is not specified in the output. Since the output does not provide any information about the variable, I will set it to a dummy value.

Finally, the `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, so I will set it to an empty dictionary.
