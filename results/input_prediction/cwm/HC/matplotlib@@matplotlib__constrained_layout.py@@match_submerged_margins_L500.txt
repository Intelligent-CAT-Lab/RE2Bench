Let me try to figure out the input for `match_submerged_margins` based on the given output.

The output shows that the function returned a list of two Axes objects. This suggests that `match_submerged_margins` was called on a figure that contains two axes. Also, the `layoutgrids` argument seems to have information about the gridspec and figure layout.

First, I need to determine what `layoutgrids` looks like. It seems to be a dictionary where keys are grid specs or figures, and values are some layout information. The output doesn't specify the exact structure, but since the function uses `lg1.margin_vals` and `lg1.edit_margin_min`, it's likely that each value in `layoutgrids` is an object with these attributes.

The `fig` argument is a figure object. The function iterates over `fig.subfigs` and `fig.get_axes()`, so the figure must have at least two axes. The axes are filtered based on their subplot specs and whether they are in the layout.

Given the output, I think the input might involve a figure with a gridspec that has two columns. The `layoutgrids` would then contain information about this gridspec and the figure's layout.

Let me try to construct a possible input based on this reasoning.
