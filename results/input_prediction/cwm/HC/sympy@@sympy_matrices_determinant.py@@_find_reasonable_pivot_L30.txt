1. The output indicates that the function returned (0, "-9", False, []). 
2. This suggests that the first element in the column (index 0) is the pivot, and its value is "-9". 
3. The function checks if all elements are numeric (Float or Integer) and at least one is a Float. 
4. Since "-9" is an Integer, but the output indicates it's treated as a numeric value, we can infer that the column contains numeric values, possibly with "-9" being the maximum absolute value.
5. The `iszerofunc` checks if the maximum value is zero. Since "-9" is not zero, the function returns the index of "-9" (which is 0) and the value "-9".
6. The `newly_determined` list is empty, indicating no additional simplifications or determinations were made.
7. Therefore, the input column must contain "-9" as its first element, and possibly other numeric values, but "-9" is the maximum absolute value.
8. The `iszerofunc` is likely `_iszero`, which checks if an expression is zero.
9. The `simpfunc` is `_simplify`, which simplifies expressions.
