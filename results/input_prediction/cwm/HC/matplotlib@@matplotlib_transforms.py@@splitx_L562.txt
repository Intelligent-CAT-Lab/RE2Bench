Okay, let's break this down. The output shows three Bbox objects created by splitting the original Bbox horizontally. The Bbox coordinates suggest that the original Bbox had a width from 0.125 to 0.9 (so total width 0.775) and height from ~0.1 to 0.9 (height 0.8). The splitx function divides this horizontally into three parts based on the given arguments.

First, the splitx method takes a list of x-coordinates (args) that define the split points. The function first creates a list xf that starts with 0, includes the provided args, and ends with 1. Then, it calculates the width of the original Bbox (w = x1 - x0). The split points are then converted into fractions of this width to determine the new x-coordinates for the split Bboxes.

Looking at the output Bboxes:
1. The first Bbox starts at 0.125 (x0) and ends at 0.78375. The width here is 0.78375 - 0.125 = 0.65875.
2. The second Bbox starts and ends at 0.78375, which suggests a zero width. Wait, that can't be right. But maybe it's a vertical line at that x-coordinate? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the split points.
3. The third Bbox starts at 0.78375 and ends at 0.9, with a width of 0.11625.

Hmm, the second Bbox having the same x0 and x1 suggests that one of the split points might be at 0.78375. Let's see how the split points are calculated.

The original Bbox's x0 is 0.125, x1 is 0.9. The total width w is 0.775. The splitx function uses the args to create xf = [0, *args, 1]. Then, for each pair of consecutive xf values (xf0, xf1), it computes new x-coordinates as x0 + xf0 * w and x0 + xf1 * w.

Let's denote the args as [a, b]. Then xf becomes [0, a, b, 1]. The pairs would be (0,a), (a,b), (b,1). The corresponding x-coordinates would be:

For (0,a): x0 + 0*w = 0.125, x0 + a*w = 0.125 + a*0.775
For (a,b): x0 + a*w, x0 + b*w
For (b,1): x0 + b*w, x0 + 1*w = 0.9

Looking at the output Bboxes:
- The first Bbox's x1 is 0.78375. So 0.125 + a*0.775 = 0.78375. Solving for a: a = (0.78375 - 0.125)/0.775 ≈ 0.65875 / 0.775 ≈ 0.85. But 0.85 * 0.775 = 0.65875, which added to 0.125 gives 0.78375. So a ≈ 0.85.

- The second Bbox has x0 and x1 both 0.78375, implying that a*w = b*w, so a = b. But that would mean the second Bbox has zero width. However, the output shows a Bbox with x0 and x1 the same, which is possible if the split point is exactly at that x-coordinate. Alternatively, maybe the args include a value that results in this.

Wait, maybe the args are [0.85, 0.85]. Let's check:

If args = [0.85, 0.85], then xf = [0, 0.85, 0.85, 1]. The pairs are (0,0.85), (0.85,0.85), (0.85,1).

First pair: x0 + 0*0.775 = 0.125, x0 + 0.85*0.775 = 0.125 + 0.65875 = 0.78375. So first Bbox is [[0.125, 0.1], [0.78375, 0.9]].

Second pair: x0 + 0.85*0.775 = 0.78375, x0 + 0.85*0.775 = 0.78375. So the Bbox is [[0.78375, 0.1], [0.78375, 0.9]], which is a vertical line.

Third pair: x0 + 0.85*0.775 = 0.78375, x0 + 1*0.775 = 0.9. So third Bbox is [[0.78375, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]].

This matches the output exactly. Therefore, the args must be [0.85, 0.85].

But wait, the problem states that the input is in JSON format, and the structure includes "args": {"args": XXX}. So the args parameter of splitx is a tuple or list containing the split points. In this case, the args would be (0.85, 0.85).

Now, let's look at the self object. The BboxBase class has a get_points method that returns the points defining the Bbox. The extents property flattens these points into x0, y0, x1, y1. The original Bbox's extents are [0.125, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9], which implies the points are [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]].

Therefore, the self object's _points should be [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]. The other attributes like _parents, _invalid, etc., might be default or irrelevant for this problem. Since the structure includes "_invalid": XXX, "_shorthand_name": XXX, etc., but the problem doesn't provide their values, we can assume they are not necessary for the function's execution in this case, or set them to default values (like null or empty objects).

Putting it all together, the input should have self with _points set to [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]], and args set to [0.85, 0.85].
