To predict the input of `_get_bracket`, we need to reverse engineer the output. The output is a list of vertices and codes, which form a shape (probably an arrow bracket). Let's break it down:

The vertices are:
[
    [363.0020718742162, 304.4117647058823],
    [358.0020718742162, 304.4117647058823],
    [358.0020718742162, 354.4117647058823],
    [363.0020718742162, 354.4117647058823]
]
These coordinates form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle in the x-direction is approximately 5 units (363 - 358), and in the y-direction, it's approximately 50 units (354 - 304).

The codes are [1, 2, 2, 2], which correspond to MOVETO, LINETO, LINETO, LINETO. This suggests the path starts at the first vertex and draws lines to the subsequent vertices.

To determine the input parameters, let's look at how `_get_bracket` calculates these values. The function uses `get_cos_sin` to calculate the direction vector from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1), and `get_normal_points` to calculate the perpendicular points at a distance `width` from the line.

Given the coordinates, we can infer:
- The line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) is approximately horizontal, given the small change in y-coordinates (304 to 304) and significant change in x-coordinates (358 to 363).
- The width is the distance from the line to the bracket, which is approximately 5 units (half of 10, considering both sides).
- The length is the distance along the line, which is approximately 50 units (354 - 304).

However, these are rough estimates. To get precise values, we need to consider the calculations in `_get_bracket`.

The function `get_cos_sin(x0, y0, x1, y1)` calculates the cosine and sine of the angle between the line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) and the x-axis. Given the coordinates, this angle is very small (almost horizontal).

The function `get_normal_points` calculates the perpendicular points at a distance `width` from the line. The width here is likely 5 units, considering the x-coordinates of the vertices (363 and 358).

The length of the bracket is the distance along the line, which is approximately 50 units (354 - 304).

The angle parameter is 0, as there's no rotation applied to the bracket in the output.

Now, let's determine the input parameters:
- x0 and y0: These are the starting coordinates of the line. Given the vertices, x0 is likely around 358, and y0 is around 304.
- x1 and y1: These are the ending coordinates of the line. Given the vertices, x1 is likely around 363, and y1 is around 304.
- width: This is the distance from the line to the bracket, which is approximately 5 units.
- length: This is the distance along the line, which is approximately 50 units.
- angle: This is 0, as there's no rotation.

However, the exact values of x0, y0, x1, and y1 depend on the specific calculation in `_get_bracket`. To get the exact values, we need to consider the transformation applied to the vertices.

The transformation is applied if the angle is not 0. In this case, the angle is 0, so no transformation is applied. Therefore, the vertices are the result of the calculation in `_get_bracket` without any rotation.

Given the vertices, we can calculate the exact values of x0, y0, x1, and y1. However, this would require solving the equations in `_get_bracket`, which is complex.

Alternatively, we can make an educated guess based on the coordinates. Let's assume x0 is 358, y0 is 304, x1 is 363, and y1 is 304. The width is 5, and the length is 50.

Now, let's consider the other parameters in the structure:
- head_length, head_width, widthA, widthB, lengthA, lengthB, angleA, angleB, scaleA, scaleB: These are attributes of the `_Curve` class and are not directly related to the input of `_get_bracket`. However, they might be used in the calculation of the bracket. For simplicity, let's assume they are default values or not relevant to this specific call.
- _beginarrow_head, _beginarrow_bracket, _endarrow_head, _endarrow_bracket: These are also attributes of the `_Curve` class and are not directly related to the input of `_get_bracket`.

Given the complexity of the calculation and the lack of exact values, we'll make an educated guess for the input parameters.
