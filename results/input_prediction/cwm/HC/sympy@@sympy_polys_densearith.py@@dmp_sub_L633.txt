To determine the input of `dmp_sub` that results in an empty list output, we need to analyze how `dmp_sub` operates.

1. The function `dmp_sub` subtracts two dense polynomials in `K[X]`, where `u` is the number of variables (the degree of the polynomial in `K[X]`).
2. If `u` is 0, it directly subtracts `g` from `f` using `_dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K))`.
3. If `u > 0`, it first checks the degrees of `f` and `g`. If `f` is the zero polynomial (`df < 0`), it returns the negation of `g`. If `g` is the zero polynomial (`dg < 0`), it returns `f`.
4. If both have non-negative degrees, it proceeds to subtract term-wise based on their degrees.

Given the output is an empty list, it suggests that either `f` and `g` are such that their subtraction results in a zero polynomial at level `u`, or the subtraction at the lower levels results in an empty list after stripping leading zeros.

Considering `dmp_sub` returns `[]` (empty list), let's explore the simplest case where `u = 0` because this directly calls `dup_sub`, which could return an empty list if the subtraction results in a zero polynomial.

For `u = 0`, the function becomes:
```
return _dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K))
```
If `dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K)` returns `[]`, then `_dmp` would return `[]`.

`dup_sub` subtracts two dense univariate polynomials. If `f` and `g` are identical, `dup_sub(f, g, K)` would return `[]`.

Thus, a possible input is when `f` and `g` are the same polynomial, and `u = 0`.

Now, let's construct such an input:

- `f` and `g` should be the same polynomial. Let's choose a simple polynomial, say `[1, 2, 3]` (representing `3x^2 + 2x + 1`).
- `u = 0` because we want to directly use `dup_sub`.
- `K` can be any domain, but since the problem doesn't specify, let's use a simple one like `ZZ` (integers).

Therefore, the input could be:
