Let's break down the problem step by step.

The output given is a sparse matrix with 2 stored elements and a shape of (2, 2). This suggests that there are two features and two samples, with each feature having one non-zero entry.

Looking at the `transform` function of `OneHotEncoder`, the output is a sparse matrix if `sparse_output` is True (which it is by default). The matrix's shape is determined by the number of samples and the number of features after encoding.

Given the structure of the input, we need to figure out what `X` (the input data) and the encoder's parameters would result in this output.

First, let's consider the encoder's parameters:
- `categories`: This determines how each feature is encoded. If it's 'auto', the encoder will automatically determine the categories for each feature.
- `sparse_output`: This is True, so the output is a sparse matrix.
- `dtype`: The data type of the output, which is np.float64 in this case.
- `handle_unknown`: How to handle unknown categories. Since there's no error mentioned, it's likely set to 'error', 'ignore', or another option that doesn't raise an error.
- `drop`: Whether to drop one category per feature. If set, it would reduce the number of output features.
- `min_frequency` and `max_categories`: These could influence the number of categories considered, but without more info, it's hard to say.
- `feature_name_combiner`: How feature names are combined, but this doesn't affect the output shape.

The key is the output shape (2, 2). This means there are 2 samples and 2 features after encoding. If the original data had 2 features and each was encoded into 1 category ( possibly due to `drop` being 'first' or 'if_binary'), that could result in 2 output features.

Now, let's think about `X`. If `X` is a 2x2 array where each column has a single unique value (and thus encoded into one category), that could work. For example:

```
X = [[1, 'a'],
     [2, 'b']]
```

If `categories` is 'auto', the encoder would determine that the first feature has categories [1, 2] and the second has ['a', 'b']. If `drop` is 'first', it would drop the first category for each feature, resulting in 1 category per feature, hence 2 output features.

But since the output is a sparse matrix with 2 stored elements, each sample must have exactly one non-zero entry per feature. This suggests that each sample has a unique combination of categories.

Putting this all together, a possible input `X` could be a 2x2 array with two unique values in each column, and the encoder's `drop` parameter set to 'first' to reduce the number of output features to 2.

However, without more specific information about the encoder's state (like `categories_`, `_n_features_outs`, etc.), it's challenging to pinpoint the exact input. But based on the output shape and the behavior of `OneHotEncoder`, we can make an educated guess.
