Let's try to reverse-engineer the input for the `score_samples` method given the output.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is an array of two elements, both -0.79370053. This suggests that the input data has two samples, and both are equally "normal" according to the Isolation Forest model.

2. **Isolation Forest Behavior**: Isolation Forest works by building multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data. The score for a sample is based on the average path length from the root to the leaf in each tree. Lower scores indicate more normal samples (since they are easier to isolate), while higher scores indicate outliers.

3. **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated as $2^{-\frac{d}{L}}$, where $d$ is the average path length for a sample across all trees, and $L$ is the average path length for the entire dataset across all trees. The negative of this score is returned by `score_samples`, so the output we see is the negative of the actual score used internally.

4. **Input Data**: To get two identical scores, the input data likely has two identical samples. Given the score value, we can infer that these samples are not outliers but are normal data points.

5. **Model Parameters**: The model parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_samples`, `max_features`, etc., are not directly inferable from the output but are crucial for the model's behavior. However, since the output is consistent, we can assume default or simple values for these parameters.

6. **Constructing the Input**: The input `X` should be a 2D array (or similar structure) with two rows (samples) and some number of features. Given the score, it's likely that the features are numeric and the data is not sparse.

7. **Putting It All Together**: The input `X` could be a simple 2x2 array with identical rows, but without more context on the features, we can't know the exact values. However, the structure of the input can be inferred.
