[/EXAMPLE]
<think>
1. To get output "n + n**(-n)", the input must be an expression that simplifies to "n + n**(-n)".
2. Since the simplify function applies various mathematical simplifications, the input expression should be in a form that doesn't get altered by these simplifications.
3. Considering the structure of "n + n**(-n)", it's likely the input is the same as the output because there are no obvious simplifications that can be applied to "n + n**(-n)" using the functions in the simplify function.
4. The functions in the simplify function handle operations like factoring, expanding, combining like terms, etc. Since "n + n**(-n)" doesn't have like terms that can be combined, it's probable that the input expression is "n + n**(-n)" itself.
