Let's analyze the given output to predict the input for the `update_from_data_xy` function.

First, the output indicates that nothing changed (null output), implying that the update didn't modify any values. This could mean that either the input data was empty or the existing data wasn't altered by the new points.

Looking at the `update_from_data_xy` function, if `len(xy) == 0`, it immediately returns without doing anything. This aligns with the null output we see.

Therefore, the most straightforward explanation is that the input `xy` was an empty array or list, leading to no changes in the bounding box.

Now, let's construct the input structure based on this reasoning.
