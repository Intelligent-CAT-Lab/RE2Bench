1. The output of `get_weight` is "normal". This suggests that the instance's `_weight` attribute is set to "normal".
2. Looking at the `set_weight` method, if the provided weight is a string that exists in `weight_dict`, it is assigned directly to `_weight`. Otherwise, it is converted to an integer and checked if it is between 0 and 1000.
3. Since the output is "normal", which is likely a valid key in `weight_dict`, the `_weight` attribute must have been set using `set_weight` with the argument "normal".
4. The `FontProperties` instance must have been initialized with `weight="normal"` or the default value from the rcParams was used, which in this case is "normal".

Therefore, the input to `get_weight` should have `_weight` set to "normal". The other attributes (`_family`, `_slant`, `_variant`, `_stretch`, `_file`, `_size`, `_math_fontfamily`) can be any valid values since they do not affect the output of `get_weight`.
