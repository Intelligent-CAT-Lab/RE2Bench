Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the input to the `axis_aligned_extrema` method that results in the given output. The output is two empty lists, which suggests that the Bezier segment has no axis-aligned extrema.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `axis_aligned_extrema` method finds the local extrema (maxima or minima) along each axis of a Bezier curve. If the degree of the Bezier curve is 1 or less, it returns empty arrays because linear or constant curves do not have local extrema.

2. **Degree of the Curve**: The method first checks if the degree `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns empty arrays. Therefore, to achieve the given output, the degree of the Bezier curve must be 1 or 0.

3. **Degree Calculation**: The degree of a Bezier curve is one less than the number of control points (`_N`). So, if the degree is 1, `_N` must be 2. If the degree is 0, `_N` must be 1.

4. **Control Points**: The control points (`_cpoints`) define the shape of the Bezier curve. For a linear curve (degree 1), two control points are needed. For a constant curve (degree 0), one control point is sufficient.

5. **Other Attributes**: The other attributes like `_d` (dimension), `_orders`, and `_px` are derived from the control points. `_d` is the dimension of the control points (e.g., 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D). `_orders` is an array of indices from 0 to `_N-1`. `_px` is a weighted version of the control points used in the Bezier curve formula.

6. **Predicting the Input**: To get the output of two empty lists, we can assume a linear Bezier curve (degree 1) with two control points. Let's choose simple 2D points for `_cpoints`, such as `[[0, 0], [1, 1]]`. This will make `_N = 2`, `_d = 2`, `_orders = [0, 1]`, and `_px` will be calculated accordingly.

Let's calculate `_px` for the control points `[[0, 0], [1, 1]]`:
- The coefficient for each control point in a linear Bezier curve is `[1, 1]` (since `math.factorial(1) // (math.factorial(0) * math.factorial(1)) = 1` and similarly for the second point).
- Therefore, `_px = (control_points.T * [1, 1]).T = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]`.

So, the input should look like this:
