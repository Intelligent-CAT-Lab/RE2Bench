Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output of the `_fit_truncated` method includes several components such as `U`, `S`, `Vt`, `X`, `x_is_centered`, and `xp`. The key part here is identifying the shape and structure of `X` and the values of `n_components` and `svd_solver`, as these are crucial for determining the input.

2. **Identifying `n_components`**: The `n_components` parameter determines the number of principal components to retain. Looking at the `S` (singular values) part of the output, it has 3 values: [1.53014566, 0.68813295, 0.61174013]. This suggests that `n_components` is 3 because there are three singular values retained.

3. **Determining `svd_solver`**: The `svd_solver` can be inferred from the structure of the output. The `U` matrix has a shape of (5, 3), and `Vt` has a shape of (3, 10). This suggests that the SVD was computed using a method that can handle sparse matrices efficiently, possibly 'arpack' or 'randomized'. However, given the structure and the fact that `U` and `Vt` are not full matrices, 'arpack' is a strong candidate because it's designed for sparse matrices and can compute a subset of eigenvalues.

4. **Analyzing `X`**: The `X` matrix is not explicitly shown in the output, but we can infer its shape from the dimensions of `U` and `Vt`. Since `U` is (5, 3) and `Vt` is (3, 10), `X` must be a 5x10 matrix. Additionally, the fact that `issparse(X)` is true (as indicated by the use of `mean_variance_axis` for sparse matrices) tells us that `X` is a sparse matrix.

5. **Putting It All Together**: Given the above points, we can deduce that the input `X` is a 5x10 sparse matrix, `n_components` is 3, and `svd_solver` is 'arpack'. The `xp` (array API module) is likely 'numpy' given the context, but since it's not directly relevant to the input structure, we can focus on the essential parameters.

Now, let's construct the input based on these deductions.
