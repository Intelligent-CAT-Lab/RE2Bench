We are given the output of `__new__` for the `BlockMatrix` class, which is a SymPy matrix object. The output shows a 2x2 block matrix composed of four smaller matrices. 

1. The `BlockMatrix` constructor expects a sequence of rows, where each row is a sequence of matrices. Looking at the output matrix, the structure is:
   ```
   [
     [Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]]), Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])],
     [Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]]), Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])]
   ]
   ```

2. Therefore, the `args` passed to `__new__` should be a list containing these two rows. Each row is a list of the corresponding matrices.

3. The `cls` parameter in `__new__` is the class itself, which in this case is `BlockMatrix`.

So, the input to `__new__` should be the class `BlockMatrix` and the list of rows as described.
