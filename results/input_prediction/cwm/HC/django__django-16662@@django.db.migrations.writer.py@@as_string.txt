I need to predict the input to the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class, given the output provided. Let me analyze the output first.

The output is a migration class definition with empty dependencies and operations. This suggests that the `migration` object passed to `MigrationWriter` has no operations and no dependencies.

Looking at the structure provided for the input, I see that it includes a `self` object with a `migration` attribute, which has `operations`, `__module__`, and `__doc__` attributes. The `include_header` and `needs_manual_porting` attributes are also part of `self`.

Given the output, I can infer that:
1. `operations` is an empty list because there are no operations in the output.
2. `dependencies` is also empty, which aligns with the empty dependencies list in the output.
3. `__module__` and `__doc__` might be related to the migration's metadata, but since they don't affect the output directly (as seen in the provided output), I can assume default or empty values for them.
4. `include_header` is likely `False` because the output does not include a header comment that starts with "# Generated by Django".
5. `needs_manual_porting` is probably `False` since there's no indication of manual porting needs in the output.

Now, let me structure this into the required input format.
