To solve this, let's go through the steps of how the `_rank` function works and deduce the input based on the output.

1. **Output Analysis**: The output is `1`, which means the rank of the matrix `M` is `1`. This implies that the matrix has at least one non-zero element, but not enough to form a square submatrix of size greater than `1` with non-zero determinant.

2. **Function Flow**:
    - The function `_rank` first checks if the matrix has zero rows or columns, in which case the rank is `0`.
    - If the matrix has one row or one column, it checks if there's at least one non-zero element. If yes, the rank is `1`.
    - For a `2x2` matrix, it checks if all elements are zero (rank `0`), or if the determinant is zero but at least one element is non-zero (rank `1`), or if the determinant is non-zero (rank `2`).
    - For larger matrices, it permutes columns to simplify the matrix, performs row reduction, and counts the number of pivot columns as the rank.

3. **Deducing Input**:
    - Since the output rank is `1`, we can infer that the matrix `M` is not a `2x2` matrix with a non-zero determinant (which would give rank `2`).
    - It's also not a matrix with all zero elements (which would give rank `0`).
    - The simplest case that gives rank `1` is a matrix with one row or one column that has at least one non-zero element.

4. **Constructing the Input**:
    - Let's assume `M` is a `1x1` matrix with a non-zero element, e.g., `[[1]]`.
    - `iszerofunc` should be a function that returns `True` for zero and `False` for non-zero elements. A common choice is `_iszero`, which returns `True` if an element is zero and `None` otherwise.
    - `simplify` is set to `False` by default, so we can leave it as such.

Given these considerations, the input that would lead to the output `1` for the `_rank` function could be:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "M": [[1]],
        "iszerofunc": "_iszero",
        "simplify": false
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
