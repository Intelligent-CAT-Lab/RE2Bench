The given output is a bytearray of length 512 (LUT_SIZE), where all entries are 0 except for the last entry, which is 1. This suggests that the lookup table (LUT) was initialized using the default values and not modified by any patterns. The default LUT is built using the `build_default_lut` method, which sets each entry to 0 if the 5th bit (from the right, 0-indexed) is 0 and to 1 if it's 1. However, the final output shows that only the last entry (i = 511) is 1, implying that the 5th bit is set only in that position.

To achieve this output, the `patterns` list must be empty because any pattern would modify the LUT entries. The `lut` attribute is initialized as None but gets set by `build_default_lut`, which is called at the beginning of `build_lut`.

Therefore, the input to `build_lut` must have an empty `patterns` list and `lut` set to None.
