To determine the input of `exptrigsimp` given the output, we need to analyze the output structure and relate it back to the input requirements of the function.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output provided is a dictionary with a key `"nargs"` that contains another dictionary. This inner dictionary has a key `"_elements"` with a value of `"frozenset({1})"`. This suggests that the function `exptrigsimp` is dealing with an expression that, after simplification, has a structure involving a single element, likely a coefficient or a simplified term.

2. **Relating Output to Input**: The `exptrigsimp` function takes an expression `expr` as input and simplifies it, potentially involving trigonometric and exponential functions. The output indicates a simplified form, but without explicit details on the original expression, we must infer based on common usage and the nature of `exptrigsimp`.

3. **Considering Possible Inputs**: Given that the output hints at a simplified expression with a single element, a plausible input could be an expression that, when simplified using `exptrigsimp`, results in a form that matches the output structure. This could involve expressions with trigonometric functions, exponentials, or combinations thereof that simplify down to a single term or coefficient.

4. **Identifying the Input Structure**: The input structure provided is a dictionary with keys `"self"`, `"args"`, and `"kwargs"`. The `"args"` key contains another dictionary with an `"expr"` key, which is where the input expression for `exptrigsimp` would be placed.

Given these considerations, and without a direct, explicit example to draw from, we must recognize that the input to `exptrigsimp` would be an expression that simplifies to a form consistent with the output. However, the exact nature of this expression cannot be directly inferred without more specific information about the output's meaning or additional context.

To proceed with the required format but acknowledging the ambiguity:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "expr": "YourExpressionHere"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

Please replace `"YourExpressionHere"` with an actual expression that, when simplified by `exptrigsimp`, would yield an output consistent with the provided structure, indicating a simplified form involving a single element. The exact expression would depend on the specific requirements or constraints of the problem not fully detailed in the provided information.
