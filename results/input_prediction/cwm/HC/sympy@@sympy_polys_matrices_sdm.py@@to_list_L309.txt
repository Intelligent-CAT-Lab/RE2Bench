Based on the output, it seems that the input to the `to_list` method is a sparse matrix `SDM` instance. The output shows a 2x2 grid of matrices, which suggests that the input matrix has 4 elements, each corresponding to one of these matrices. Let's analyze the structure of the output to determine the input.

The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two matrices. This implies that the input matrix `M` has 2 rows and 2 columns. The matrices in the output are:

1. Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])
2. Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])
3. Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
4. Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])

These matrices are likely the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix `M`. In a sparse matrix, only non-zero elements are stored. Therefore, the input matrix `M` should have these matrices as its non-zero elements.

Looking at the structure of the input, we see that it's a dictionary where the keys are row indices and the values are dictionaries with column indices as keys and matrix objects as values. 

So, the input matrix `M` should be structured as follows:
- Row 0, Column 0: Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])
- Row 0, Column 1: Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])
- Row 1, Column 0: Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
- Row 1, Column 1: Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])

Now, let's construct the input dictionary based on this analysis.
