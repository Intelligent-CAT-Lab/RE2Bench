1. Output is `True`, so item must satisfy the specifier set.
2. The item is an unparsed version, which will be coerced into a `Version` object.
3. For `SpecifierSet.contains()` to return `True`, at least one of the specifiers in `_specs` must accept the version. If there are no specifiers, it returns `True` for non-prerelease versions if `_prereleases` is `False` or unspecified. If `_prereleases` is `True` or there are specifiers that accept prereleases, then prereleases are accepted.
4. Since the output is `True`, consider possible versions and specifier configurations.
   - Suppose the specifier is `">=1.0"`, and the item is `"1.0"`. `_coerce_version` would convert it to `Version("1.0")`, which satisfies `>=1.0`.
   - If `_specs` is empty and `_prereleases` is `False`, non-prerelease versions return `True`.
5. To simplify, let's choose a version that is likely to be accepted and a specifier that matches it.

Possible Input:
- `_specs` could be a specifier like `">=1.0"`, and `item` is `"1.0"`.
- `_prereleases` could be `None` or `False`, as the version is not a prerelease.
