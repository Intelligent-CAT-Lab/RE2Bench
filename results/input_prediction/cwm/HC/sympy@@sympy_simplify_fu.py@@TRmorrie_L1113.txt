Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the input that would result in the given output.

The output is "cos(phi)", which suggests that the input expression, when processed by the `TRmorrie` function, should simplify or transform into this form. The `TRmorrie` function appears to be designed to simplify trigonometric expressions, particularly involving multiple-angle formulas.

Given that the output is a simple cosine function, let's consider what input might lead to this. The function `TRmorrie` uses a recursive approach (`bottom_up`) to simplify expressions from the bottom up. The key part of the function is the inner function `f`, which attempts to simplify products of trigonometric functions.

For the output to be "cos(phi)", we can hypothesize that the input expression might already be a cosine function or a product of trigonometric functions that simplifies to a cosine function. However, without specific transformations in the provided code that directly relate to simplifying to "cos(phi)", the simplest assumption is that the input is already "cos(phi)" or an equivalent expression that doesn't require transformation.

Thus, the input to `TRmorrie` that results in the output "cos(phi)" would likely be:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "rv": "cos(phi)"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
