The output shows the Digest header generated by `build_digest_header`. Let's break down how the components are derived.

1. **username**: The output shows `username="user"`. So, the `self.username` must be "user".

2. **realm**: The output shows `realm="me@kennethreitz.com"`. This comes from `self.chal['realm']`. So, the `self.chal['realm']` must be "me@kennethreitz.com".

3. **nonce**: The output shows `nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"`. This is from `self.chal['nonce']`. So, `self.chal['nonce']` is "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899".

4. **uri**: The output shows `uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"`. This comes from the `path` variable in `build_digest_header`, which is derived from `urlparse(url).path` and possibly the query string. So, the `url` argument must be "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" or include a query that appends to this path. However, since there's no query in the output URI, the `url` is likely "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

5. **response**: The output shows `response="d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460"`. This is the result of the digest calculation, which depends on the `HA1` and `HA2` values. Given the algorithm is MD5, we can infer the password from the HA1 calculation. However, since we're focusing on input reconstruction, we'll need to ensure the password is consistent with the output.

6. **opaque**: The output shows `opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"`. This comes from `self.chal['opaque']`. So, `self.chal['opaque']` is "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904".

7. **algorithm**: The output shows `algorithm="MD5"`. This comes from `self.chal['algorithm']`. So, `self.chal['algorithm']` is "MD5".

8. **qop**: The output shows `qop="auth"`. This comes from `self.chal['qop']`. So, `self.chal['qop']` is "auth".

9. **nc (nonce count)**: The output shows `nc=00000001`. This is derived from `self.nonce_count`, which is incremented each time the same nonce is used. Since it's "00000001", `self.nonce_count` must be 1, and this is the first use of this nonce.

10. **cnonce**: The output shows `cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"`. This is generated within `build_digest_header` using a hash of the nonce count, nonce, current time, and a random value. Since this is randomly generated, we can't directly infer it from the output, but we can ensure the conditions that lead to its generation are met.

Now, let's reconstruct the input based on these observations:

- `self.username` is "user".
- `self.password` needs to be such that when combined with the realm and username, it produces the correct HA1. Given the response and the algorithm, we can infer the password. However, since the exact password isn't directly shown, we'll need to ensure it's consistent with the output. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the password is "pass" (a common default), but in a real scenario, you'd need to reverse-engineer it from the HA1 value.
- `self.last_nonce` should be the same as the current nonce if this is a subsequent request with the same nonce, but since `nonce_count` is 1, it's likely the first use, so `self.last_nonce` might be empty or different.
- `self.nonce_count` is 1.
- `self.chal` contains the realm, nonce, qop, opaque, and algorithm as identified.
- `self.pos` and `self.num_401_calls` are not directly relevant to the output but are part of the structure.
- `method` is likely "GET" or another HTTP method, but since it's not shown in the output, we'll assume "GET".
- `url` is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

Putting it all together, the input should look like this:
