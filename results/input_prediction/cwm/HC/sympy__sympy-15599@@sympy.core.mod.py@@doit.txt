The function `doit` in the `Mod` class is designed to compute the modulo operation `p % q` with various checks and optimizations. Given the output of `0`, we need to determine possible inputs `p` and `q` that would result in this output.

1. **Output of 0**: The modulo operation `p % q` equals 0 if `p` is a multiple of `q`. So, `p` could be any integer multiple of `q`.

2. **Checks in `doit`**:
   - If `q` is zero, it raises an error (but the output is 0, so `q` is not zero).
   - If `p` or `q` is infinite or `nan`, the result is `nan` (but the output is 0, so neither `p` nor `q` is infinite or `nan`).
   - If `p` is 0, `q`, `-q`, or an integer with `q = 1`, the result is 0. This is a direct match for our output.

3. **Possible Inputs**:
   - `p = 0`, `q = any non-zero integer`: `0 % q = 0`.
   - `p = q`, `q = any non-zero integer`: `q % q = 0`.
   - `p = -q`, `q = any non-zero integer`: `-q % q = 0`.
   - `p = any integer`, `q = 1`: `p % 1 = 0` for any integer `p`.

Given these considerations, a simple and valid input pair is `p = 0` and `q = 5` (or any non-zero `q`).

However, to align with the structure and ensure the simplest form, let's choose `p = 0` and `q = 1` because it satisfies the condition `q == 1` directly in the `doit` function, leading to the output `0`.
