Okay, let's try to figure out what the input to the function `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens` would be, given the output provided.

The function's output is a tuple containing two elements:
1. A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents the polynomial terms.
2. A tuple of generators (variables or functions in this case).

Given the output:
```
[
    [
        {
            "(1,)": "1"
        }
    ],
    [
        "cos(phi)"
    ]
]
```

This suggests that there are two expressions being processed. The first expression results in a polynomial term with a constant coefficient "1" and no variables (since the generator list is empty in the first dictionary). The second expression results in a generator "cos(phi)".

Let's break down the possible steps:

1. **Identify the expressions (exprs):**
   - The first expression must be a constant (like 1 or any number) because it results in a constant term with no variables.
   - The second expression must involve "cos(phi)" since that's the generator in the output.

2. **Determine the options (opt):**
   - The `opt` dictionary contains a "fraction" key. Since the output doesn't show any fractional coefficients, but the first term is "1", it's possible that the fraction option is set to `True` or `False`. However, without more context, it's safer to assume it's `False` unless indicated otherwise.

3. **Construct the input structure:**
   - The `exprs` should be a list containing two elements: the constant expression and the expression involving "cos(phi)".
   - The `opt` should have "fraction" set appropriately.

Given these points, let's construct the input.

Possible expressions for `exprs` could be:
- `[1, cos(phi)]` if "cos(phi)" is a SymPy expression.
- However, since the output shows "cos(phi)" as a string in the generator list, it's possible that the actual SymPy expression is `cos(phi)`, and the string representation is just how it's displayed in the output.

But since we need to provide the input in a JSON-like structure, and assuming that "cos(phi)" is a valid SymPy expression, the input would look something like this:

    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "exprs": [
            1,
            "cos(phi)"
        ],
        "opt": {
            "fraction": false
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
