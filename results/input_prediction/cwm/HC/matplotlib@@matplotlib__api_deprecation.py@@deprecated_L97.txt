The function `deprecated` is a higher-order function that returns another function `deprecate`. The output indicates that `deprecated` is called and returns the `deprecate` function. Therefore, the input to `deprecated` must be the arguments that define the deprecation notice, but since `deprecated` doesn't perform any immediate computation (it just defines and returns `deprecate`), the specific values of these arguments don't affect the output shown. However, to fulfill the structure requirement, we need to provide some values for the arguments.

Given that the output is the `deprecate` function, the input arguments to `deprecated` can be arbitrary as long as they are valid. For simplicity, let's assume default or empty values where possible.
