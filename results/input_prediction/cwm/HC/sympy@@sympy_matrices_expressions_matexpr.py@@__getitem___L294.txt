Let's analyze the given function and output to determine the input of `__getitem__`.

The function `__getitem__` is a method of the `MatrixExpr` class, which represents matrix expressions in SymPy. The output indicates that the result of calling `__getitem__` is "X[1, 2]", suggesting that the method is being used to access an element at row 1 and column 2 of a matrix.

Given the structure of the input, we need to fill in the `key` parameter of the `__getitem__` method. The `key` can be a tuple representing the row and column indices, or a single integer if the matrix is being indexed in a way that allows for single-dimensional indexing.

Since the output is "X[1, 2]", it implies that the `key` is a tuple `(1, 2)`.

Therefore, the input of `__getitem__` would be:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "key": (1, 2)
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
