Let's work through the problem step by step.

The output given is the string representation of a very large negative number. The function `format` is supposed to format this number according to certain parameters. Since the output is just the number as a string without any thousand separators or decimal points, we can infer that the input parameters didn't trigger any additional formatting.

First, let's look at the structure of the input. We have `number`, `decimal_sep`, and possibly other parameters like `decimal_pos`, `grouping`, etc. However, since the output is a straightforward string, it's likely that `decimal_pos` and `grouping` are set in a way that no additional formatting occurs.

Given the output, the `number` must be the integer `-359538626972463141629054847463408713596141135051689993197834953606314521560057077521179117265533756343080917907028764928468642653778928365536935093407075033972099821153102564152490980180778657888151737016910267884609166473806445896331617118664246696549595652408289446337476354361838599762500808052368249716736`. 

The `decimal_sep` is not used in this case because there's no decimal point in the output. However, we need to provide a value for it. A common choice is a period (`.`), but since it's not used, any value should work. Let's choose `.` for simplicity.

Now, let's consider the other parameters. Since there's no thousand separator in the output, `grouping` must be 0 or `force_grouping` must be False. Also, since there's no decimal point, `decimal_pos` is likely None.

Putting it all together, the input should look like this:
