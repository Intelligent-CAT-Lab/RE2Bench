Let's work backwards from the output to figure out the input.

The output is `<Axes: >`, which suggests that a single axes object was returned. This typically happens when `subplots` is called without sharing axes and with `squeeze=True` (the default). 

Looking at the `subplots` method in the `GridSpecBase` class:

1. **Figure Setup**: The method starts by checking if `self.figure` is not `None`. Since the output is an axes object, `self.figure` must be a valid figure object.

2. **Sharex and Sharey**: The `sharex` and `sharey` parameters determine whether axes are shared. Since the output is a single axes object, it's likely that `sharex` and `sharey` are both `False` (or their string equivalents `'none'`).

3. **Squeeze**: The `squeeze` parameter, if `True`, returns a single axes object when there's only one subplot. The output suggests `squeeze=True`.

4. **Subplot_kw**: This is a dictionary of keyword arguments passed to `add_subplot`. Since no special parameters are mentioned in the output, it's probably `None` or an empty dictionary.

5. **GridSpec Attributes**: The `self` object has attributes like `_nrows`, `_ncols`, `_row_height_ratios`, and `_col_width_ratios`. For a single subplot, `_nrows` and `_ncols` are likely 1. The height and width ratios would default to `[1]` if not specified.

Putting this all together:

- `self` must be a `GridSpecBase` instance with `_nrows=1`, `_ncols=1`, and default ratios.
- `sharex` and `sharey` are `False`.
- `squeeze` is `True`.
- `subplot_kw` is `None`.

Now, let's construct the input based on this reasoning.
