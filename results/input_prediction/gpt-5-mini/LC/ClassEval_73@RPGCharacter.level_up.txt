[THOUGHT]
The method level_up increases level by 1 (if <100), sets exp to 0, and adds +20 hp, +5 attack_power, +5 defense. The returned tuple is the post-update values.

Given output tuple (level, hp, attack_power, defense) = (4, 160, 35, 25):
- post-level = 4 => pre-level = 3
- post-hp = 160 => pre-hp = 160 - 20 = 140
- post-attack_power = 35 => pre-attack_power = 35 - 5 = 30
- post-defense = 25 => pre-defense = 25 - 5 = 20

exp is overwritten to 0 by level_up, so its prior value can be anything. I'll provide a plausible nonzero value (120). Provide a name string (e.g., "Hero").
