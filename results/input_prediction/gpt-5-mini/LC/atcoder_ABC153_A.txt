[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers h and a from input, computes math.ceil(h / a), and prints the result. The observed output is 6, so we need integers h and a such that ceil(h / a) == 6.

Choose h = 11 and a = 2:
- h / a = 11 / 2 = 5.5
- ceil(5.5) = 6

Therefore the input string should be "11 2".
