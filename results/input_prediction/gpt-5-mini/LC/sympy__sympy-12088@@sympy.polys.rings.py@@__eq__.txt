[THOUGHT]
We need the call to PolyElement.__eq__(p1, p2) to return True.

Look at the method:
1. if not p2:
       return not p1

So the simplest way to get True is to make p2 falsy and p1 falsy (so not p1 is True). In Python, an empty dict (and hence a PolyElement with no keys) is falsy. Therefore if p2 is an empty mapping ({}), the first branch runs and returns not p1; to make that True, p1 must also be an empty mapping (falsy).

The structure requires p1 to include an "_hash" field. We can set "_hash": null and have no other keys, representing an empty mapping-like object. Set p2 to an empty dict {}.

This satisfies the first branch and yields True.
