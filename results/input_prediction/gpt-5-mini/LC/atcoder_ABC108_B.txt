Let x1,y1,x2,y2 be the inputs.
The program sets a = x2 - x1 and b = y2 - y1, and prints:
out1 = x2 - b = x2 - (y2 - y1) = x2 - y2 + y1
out2 = y2 + a = y2 + (x2 - x1) = y2 + x2 - x1
out3 = x1 - b = x1 - (y2 - y1) = x1 - y2 + y1
out4 = y1 + a = y1 + (x2 - x1) = y1 + x2 - x1

We need these to be: 101, 99, 101, 100.

From out1 = 101 and out3 = 101:
x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
x1 - y2 + y1 = 101
Subtracting gives x2 - x1 = 0, so x2 = x1 (call it x). Then a = 0.

Out2 = y2 + x2 - x1 = y2 + 0 = y2 = 99.
Out4 = y1 + x2 - x1 = y1 + 0 = y1 = 100.

Then use out1: x2 - y2 + y1 = x - 99 + 100 = x + 1 = 101, so x = 100.

Thus x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 100, y2 = 99. The input line is "100 100 100 99".
