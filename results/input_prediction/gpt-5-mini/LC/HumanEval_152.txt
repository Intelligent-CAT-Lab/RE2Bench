[THOUGHT]
The function returns elementwise absolute differences: result[i] = abs(game[i] - guess[i]).
We need differences [2, 0, 0, 1].

Choose simple integers:
- For difference 2: pick game[0]=1, guess[0]=3 -> abs(1-3)=2
- For difference 0: pick game[1]=2, guess[1]=2 -> abs(2-2)=0
- For difference 0: pick game[2]=3, guess[2]=3 -> abs(3-3)=0
- For difference 1: pick game[3]=4, guess[3]=5 -> abs(4-5)=1

Thus game = [1, 2, 3, 4], guess = [3, 2, 3, 5].
