The get_gpa method returns sum(courses.values()) / len(courses) for the named student, provided the student exists and has a non-empty courses dict.

We need an average of 75.0. For simplicity pick "Alice" as the queried name and give her two course grades whose average is 75. For example, Mathematics = 80 and Science = 70 -> (80 + 70) / 2 = 75.0.

Fill the other students with plausible fields and course grades (they do not affect the result). Set args.name to "Alice" and kwargs to an empty dict.
