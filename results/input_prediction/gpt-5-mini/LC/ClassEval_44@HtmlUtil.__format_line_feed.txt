[THOUGHT]
The method __format_line_feed uses re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text) — it collapses any run of one or more newline characters into a single '\n'. The output string "Some sentence here." contains no newline characters. Since the regex replacement would preserve a single '\n' (it replaces runs with one '\n'), the only way to get an output with no newlines is for the input to contain no newlines at all. Therefore the input text must be exactly "Some sentence here.".
