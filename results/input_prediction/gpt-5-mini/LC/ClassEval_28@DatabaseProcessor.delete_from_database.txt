[THOUGHT]
The method delete_from_database opens a sqlite3 connection to self.database_name, executes "DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?" with (name,) as parameter, commits and closes the connection. It does not return any value, so the observed output null is exactly what this function always returns on success. The output therefore does not constrain the inputs — many possible inputs would produce null. I'll provide a typical plausible input: a database file "example.db", operating on a "users" table and deleting the row where name == "Alice". kwargs is an empty dict.
