[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (x, n) that make is_simple_power(x, n) return True.

The function logic:
- If n == 1, it returns x == 1.
- Otherwise it starts power = 1 and multiplies power by n until power >= x, then returns power == x.

Choose n != 1 so we exercise the loop. Pick x = 8 and n = 2:
- n == 1? No.
- power starts at 1.
- 1 < 8 -> power = 1 * 2 = 2
- 2 < 8 -> power = 2 * 2 = 4
- 4 < 8 -> power = 4 * 2 = 8
- 8 < 8 is false; return power == x -> 8 == 8 -> True.

Thus (x=8, n=2) produces the observed output True.
