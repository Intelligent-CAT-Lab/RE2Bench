[THOUGHT]
The method write_csv opens the given file_name for writing and calls csv.writer(...).writerows(data). If no exception is raised during opening/writing, it returns 1. To produce output 1, provide valid writable file_name and a writable iterable-of-rows for data (e.g., list of lists). Example: data = [["name","age"],["Alice","30"]] and file_name = "output.csv". The write should succeed under normal conditions, so the function will return 1.
