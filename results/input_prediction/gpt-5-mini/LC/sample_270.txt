[THOUGHT]
We need d to be {} at return. The function creates d = {} and then loops "for key in dic:". If dic is empty, the loop body never executes, so d remains {} and is returned. If dic were non-empty, the loop would attempt to mutate dic with popitem and would either populate d or raise a RuntimeError; either way return would not be the simple empty dict. Therefore the only input that yields output {} is an empty dictionary for dic.
