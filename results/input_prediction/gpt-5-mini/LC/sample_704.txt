[THOUGHT]
We need s, n, c such that f(s,n,c) returns ".".

f computes width = len(c) * n, then runs the loop for (width - len(s)) iterations, each iteration doing s = c + s. If the loop runs 0 times, s is returned unchanged.

Choose s = "." and pick n and c so width - len(s) = 0. For example, let c = "." (len(c)=1) and n = 1 => width = 1*1 = 1. Then width - len(s) = 1 - 1 = 0, so no loop iterations and the function returns the original s = ".".

Thus a valid input is s = ".", n = 1, c = ".".
