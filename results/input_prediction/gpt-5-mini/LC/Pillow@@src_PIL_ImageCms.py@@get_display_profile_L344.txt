[THOUGHT]
1. The function begins by checking if sys.platform != 'win32'. If that is true, it immediately returns None regardless of the handle value.
2. The observed output is null, so the function must have taken the early return path (platform not 'win32').
3. Therefore the handle value doesn't affect the outcome. I'll choose handle = null (None) as the simplest input.
