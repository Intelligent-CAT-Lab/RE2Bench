[THOUGHT]
The program computes lcm = LCM(x,y) and prints count = b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm, which is the number of integers in [a, b] divisible by lcm.
We need count = 57900.

Simplest choice: pick x = 1, y = 1 so lcm = 1. Then count = b - 0 = b when a = 1. So set b = 57900 and a = 1. Input line becomes: "1 1 1 57900".
