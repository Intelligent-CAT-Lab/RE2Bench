[THOUGHT]
We are given the decrypted output "AbCdEfG" produced by vigenere_decipher. The method subtracts shifts derived from the key letters (shift = ord(key_char.lower()) - ord('a')) from each ciphertext letter to produce the decrypted text. If we choose a key whose letters all correspond to shift 0 (i.e., 'a' or 'A'), then the decrypted text will equal the ciphertext (no shift applied). The simplest such key is "a".

With key = "a", for each character:
- shift = ord('a') - ord('a') = 0
- decrypted_char = (cipher_char lowered - 'a' - 0) % 26 + 'a' → same letter (case preserved)

Therefore the ciphertext must be identical to the decrypted output "AbCdEfG".
