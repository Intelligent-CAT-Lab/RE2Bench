[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that, when Permutation.__pow__ runs, lead to a returned permutation having _array_form = None and _size = 7.

Steps in __pow__:
- It converts n to int via int(n).
- It calls _af_pow(self.array_form, n). The attribute accessed is self.array_form, which is derived from _array_form. If _array_form is None, then self.array_form will be None (so _af_pow receives None).
- It then calls self._af_new(result_of__af_pow). If result_of__af_pow is None, _af_new will construct a new Permutation whose _array_form is None and which (typically) inherits or uses the original size; thus _size will be 7.

So a consistent input is:
- self._array_form = None
- self._size = 7
- self._cyclic_form = None (not used here)
- n any integer-like value (choose 2). int(n) will succeed.

This will produce a returned Permutation with _array_form null and _size 7 as given.
