We need the function to return np.True_, which happens when np.isclose(...) yields a numpy True_ scalar. That occurs in the branch where rtol is None and lx exactly equals its rounded value (or close enough).

Steps:
1. Ensure x is finite and not zero (first two checks).
2. Compute lx = log(abs(x)) / log(base). To make lx an integer exactly, choose x = base**k. For base=10, x=100.0 gives lx = 2.0.
3. With rtol=None, the function returns np.isclose(2.0, round(2.0)) -> np.isclose(2.0, 2.0) which is numpy True_.

Therefore choose x = 100.0, base = 10, rtol = null.
