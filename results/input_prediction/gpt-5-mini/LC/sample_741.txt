[THOUGHT]
We need nums[prev_p] == 1, where prev_p = p-1 except when p-1 < 0, then prev_p = len(nums)-1.

Simplest choice: let nums = [1] and p = 1.
- Compute prev_p = p - 1 = 0, which is not < 0, so prev_p stays 0.
- Return nums[0] == 1, matching the given output.

(Another valid choice would be nums = [1] and p = 0, since that wraps to the last index 0, but we'll use p = 1.)
