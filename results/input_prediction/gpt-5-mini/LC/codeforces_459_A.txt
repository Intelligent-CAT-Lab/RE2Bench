[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers anti, b, c, d.

The output "3 8 7 4" matches the final else branch print(anti, d, c, b), which runs when:
- anti != c
- b != d
- l == m where l = abs(anti - c) and m = abs(b - d)

So set anti = 3, d = 8, c = 7, b = 4. Check:
- l = abs(3 - 7) = 4
- m = abs(4 - 8) = 4
- l == m and anti != c and b != d — conditions satisfied.
The input order is anti, b, c, d -> "3 4 7 8".
