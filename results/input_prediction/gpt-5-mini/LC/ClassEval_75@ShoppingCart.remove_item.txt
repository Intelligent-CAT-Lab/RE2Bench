[THOUGHT]
The remove_item method does not return any value (implicitly returns None), so the observed output null is expected regardless of whether the item exists in self.items. To be specific and meaningful, I'll assume the item exists and the method reduces its quantity. The structure requires an "apple" entry with a price and a quantity, and the called item name. I'll set a plausible price (0.5) and quantity (3) and call remove_item with "apple" (using the default quantity=1). The call will decrement quantity from 3 to 2 and still return None, matching the observed output.
