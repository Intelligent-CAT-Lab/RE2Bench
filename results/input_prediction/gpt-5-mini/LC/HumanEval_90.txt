[THOUGHT]
The function does: lst = sorted(set(lst)); return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1].
To get output 2, the sorted unique list must have at least two elements and the element at index 1 must be 2.
The simplest choice is a list whose unique, sorted form is [1, 2], so lst[1] == 2.
An example input that yields that is [1, 2] (order doesn't matter; duplicates also fine, e.g. [2,1,2]).
I'll provide the straightforward list [1, 2].
