[THOUGHT]
get_n_splits simply returns self.n_splits. The observed output is 3, so self.n_splits must be 3.

To keep the self state consistent with the __init__ checks in the class (n_splits integral and >=2; shuffle a bool; if shuffle is False then random_state must be None), choose shuffle = False and random_state = None.

There are no constraints on X, y, groups for get_n_splits, so set them to null.
