[THOUGHT]
The function returns True only when n >= 2 and no k in range(2, n-1) divides n. That means typical prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... will make the function return True. Note that for n=2 and n=3 the loop range is empty, so they return True as well.

I'll pick a simple prime, n = 5:
- n >= 2, so the initial check passes.
- The loop iterates k = 2, 3 (range(2, 4)). 5 % 2 != 0 and 5 % 3 != 0, so the loop doesn't return False.
- The function then returns True, matching the given output.
