[THOUGHT]
We need the function to return a numpy truth value (np.True_), not a plain Python True. The expression a <= val <= b is evaluated as (a <= val) and (val <= b) in chained-comparison semantics. If the comparisons produce numpy boolean scalars (np.bool_), the final result will be that numpy scalar (since the "and" returns the second operand when the first is truthy).

Therefore choose interval elements as plain Python ints (e.g., 0 and 1) and choose val as a numpy scalar integer, e.g. np.int64(0). Comparing a Python int to a numpy scalar yields a numpy.bool_ result. For interval (0, 1) and val np.int64(0), both comparisons are True and the overall returned value will be np.True_.

So set interval to [0, 1] and val to np.int64(0).
