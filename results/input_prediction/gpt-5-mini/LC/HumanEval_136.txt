[THOUGHT]
The function builds two lists: smallest = items < 0, largest = items > 0.
It returns (max(smallest) if any negatives else None, min(largest) if any positives else None).

Given output [-1, null]:
- The first returned value is -1, so smallest is non-empty and max(smallest) == -1. That means the negatives present include -1 and no negative greater than -1 (so -1 is the largest negative).
- The second returned value is null, meaning largest is empty → there are no positive numbers in the input.

The simplest input satisfying this is a list containing only -1 (e.g. [-1]). This yields smallest = [-1] → max = -1, and largest = [] → None.
