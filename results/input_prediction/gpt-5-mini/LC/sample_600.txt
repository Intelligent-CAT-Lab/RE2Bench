[THOUGHT]
The function maps each element num in array to 'n' * num, producing just_ns, then appends each element of just_ns into final_output and returns it. To have the returned final_output be an empty list, just_ns must be empty, which means the input array must be empty (no elements to map). Therefore array = [].
