[THOUGHT]
The function:
- If text is non-empty and text.isupper() is True, it returns the whole string lowercased.
- Otherwise it returns the first three characters of text.lower().

We need output "mty". That can come from:
- The uppercase branch if the input was "MTY" (uppercased), which lowercases to "mty".
- Or the other branch if the input's first three lowercased characters are "mty" (e.g. "mty", "mTy", etc.).

I will choose the straightforward uppercase case: input text = "MTY", which triggers the isupper() branch and returns "mty".
