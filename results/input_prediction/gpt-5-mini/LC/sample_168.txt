[THOUGHT]
The function builds a translation table mapping the character text[index] to new_value, then translates the whole string (so every occurrence of that character is replaced).

We need text.translate(...) to produce "spaib". A simple way is to start from "spain" and replace the final character 'n' with 'b'. For text = "spain", index = 4 (text[4] == 'n') and new_value = "b", the translation maps 'n' -> 'b' and yields "spaib". This matches the desired output.
