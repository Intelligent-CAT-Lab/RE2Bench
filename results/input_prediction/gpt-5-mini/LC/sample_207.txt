Function f initializes an empty dict d and then iterates over the iterable commands, calling d.update(c) for each element c. The final returned d is the result of merging all dictionaries in order (later keys override earlier ones).

We need commands such that after applying updates sequentially the final dictionary is:
{"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}

A straightforward commands list that yields that result is:
[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]

Step-by-step:
- Start: d = {}
- After update({"brown": 2}): d = {"brown": 2}
- After update({"blue": 5}): d = {"brown": 2, "blue": 5}
- After update({"bright": 4}): d = {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}
This matches the required output.
