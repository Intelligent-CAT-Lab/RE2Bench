[THOUGHT]
The function makes a shallow copy of the dict and calls popitem(), which removes the last inserted key-value pair (dicts preserve insertion order). The returned dict is the copied dict after that removal.

The observed output dict is {"l": 1, "t": 2}, so the original dictionary must have contained those two pairs plus one additional pair that was the last item and got removed by popitem(). The structure shows the extra key is "x:". Therefore the input should be {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": <some value>} with "x:" placed last in insertion order. I'll pick 3 for that value.
