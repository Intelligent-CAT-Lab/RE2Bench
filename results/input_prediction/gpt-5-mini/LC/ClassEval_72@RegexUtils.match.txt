[THOUGHT]
The method returns False when re.match(pattern, text) yields no match (ans is None). re.match tries to match the pattern at the start of the text. A simple choice that produces no match is a pattern that looks for "a" while the text starts with "b" (or any different character). For example, pattern = "a" and text = "b" gives re.match("a", "b") -> None, so the function returns False. I'll use that as the input.
