[THOUGHT]
We need an input morsel that results in a successful call to create_cookie and thus returns a Cookie object. The test harness serializes the return value to JSON; Cookie objects are not JSON-serializable, so the observed output is {"output": null}. That means the function completed normally (no exception) and returned a Cookie object.

To avoid exceptions:
- morsel['max-age'] must be falsy (so we don't try to convert a non-integer).
- morsel['expires'] must be falsy (so we don't try to parse a date string).
With both falsy, expires stays None and create_cookie is called.

Provide typical safe values:
- empty strings for "max-age", "expires", "comment", "domain", "secure", "httponly"
- a normal path "/" and version 0
- samesite can be null (not used by the function)

This input will let morsel_to_cookie run create_cookie and return a Cookie object (serialized as null in the output).
