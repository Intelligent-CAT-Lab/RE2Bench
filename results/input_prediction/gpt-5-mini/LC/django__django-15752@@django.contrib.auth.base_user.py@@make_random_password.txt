[THOUGHT]
1. The function BaseUserManager.make_random_password calls get_random_string(length, allowed_chars).
2. The output "PNFHWJjwvd" has length 10, so the function was called with length equal to 10 (the default).
3. All characters in "PNFHWJjwvd" appear in the default allowed_chars string ('abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'), so the default allowed_chars was used.
4. Therefore no args or kwargs were passed; the call used the defaults. The self object can be any BaseUserManager instance; fill its fields with plausible default values.
