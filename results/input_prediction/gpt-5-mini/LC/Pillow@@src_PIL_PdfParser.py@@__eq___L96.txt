[THOUGHT]
The __eq__ method returns True only if all three conditions are true:
1) other.__class__ is self.__class__
2) other.object_id == self.object_id
3) other.generation == self.generation

The output is false, so at least one of these conditions must be false. The simplest guaranteed way to make __eq__ return False regardless of self's attributes is to make other.__class__ different from self.__class__ (condition 1 fails). I'll provide an `other` object whose __class__ value differs from the class of `self`. The object_id and generation can be any values; they don't matter once the first condition fails. I'll use an arbitrary object_id and generation.
