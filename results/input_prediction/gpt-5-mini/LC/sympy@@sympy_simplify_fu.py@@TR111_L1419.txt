[THOUGHT]
We need an input expression rv such that TR111(rv) (i.e., bottom_up(rv, f)) yields "cos(phi)**2".

Look at f:
- It only modifies nodes that are Pow instances and satisfy (rv.base.is_positive or (rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative)).
- If the base is cos and the condition holds, it returns sec(base_arg) ** (-rv.exp) (i.e. converts cos(...)**e -> sec(...)**(-e)).

Given the desired output is cos(phi)**2 (a Pow with base=cos and positive integer exponent 2), f will not change that node because the exponent is positive (so (exp.is_integer and exp.is_negative) is False) and base.is_positive will not be True for a cos(...) object. Therefore bottom_up will leave cos(phi)**2 unchanged. The simplest input that yields that output is exactly cos(phi)**2.

So set rv to the expression "cos(phi)**2".
