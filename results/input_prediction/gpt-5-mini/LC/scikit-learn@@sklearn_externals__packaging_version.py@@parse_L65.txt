[THOUGHT]
1. The parse() function attempts to construct Version(version) and returns that if no InvalidVersion is raised.
2. The observed output is "<Version('1.11.3')>", which indicates Version(...) succeeded and produced a Version object representing 1.11.3.
3. Therefore the input string passed to parse was "1.11.3" (or an equivalent canonical form). The simplest and most likely input is "1.11.3".
