[THOUGHT]
The function keeps every character for which str.isnumeric(char) is True and joins them in order. The output "123314" means the numeric characters in the input, in order, were '1','2','3','3','1','4'. Any non-numeric characters between them are ignored. A simple input that yields this is the string with those digits separated by spaces: "1 2 3 3 1 4". Filtering out non-numeric characters (spaces) returns "123314".
