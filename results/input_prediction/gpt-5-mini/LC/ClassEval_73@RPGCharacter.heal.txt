[THOUGHT]
The heal method increases hp by 10 and then caps it at 100:
    self.hp += 10
    if self.hp > 100:
        self.hp = 100
It returns the resulting hp. The output is 100, so the hp before calling heal must have been >= 90 (90 -> 100 exactly; >90 -> capped to 100). I'll pick a pre-heal hp of 95 so healing yields 105 which is then capped to 100. Other attributes can be reasonable defaults (level 1, exp 0).
