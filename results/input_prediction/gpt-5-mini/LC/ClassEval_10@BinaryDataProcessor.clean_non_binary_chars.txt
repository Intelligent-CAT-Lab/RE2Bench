[THOUGHT]
The method clean_non_binary_chars is an instance method that takes only self. When __init__ calls it, self.binary_string has been set to the value passed to the constructor. clean_non_binary_chars replaces self.binary_string with the concatenation of only the characters '0' and '1' from the current string and does not return anything (so output is null).

For example, if the initial binary_string is "10a01b2":
- Characters processed: '1','0','a','0','1','b','2'
- Filter keeps only '1','0','0','1' → new self.binary_string becomes "1001"
- The method returns None (null in JSON), which matches the given output.

Therefore the input self.binary_string before cleaning could be "10a01b2".
