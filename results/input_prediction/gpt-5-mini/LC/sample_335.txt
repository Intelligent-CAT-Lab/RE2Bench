[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (text, to_remove) that make f(...) return "sjbrfqmw".

Function behavior:
- new_text = list(text)
- if to_remove in new_text: the function removes the first occurrence of to_remove (with some extra steps that still remove that first occurrence unless there's an earlier '?').
- if to_remove is not in new_text: the if-block is skipped and the function returns ''.join(new_text) which is exactly the original text.

Simplest way to get the output "sjbrfqmw" is to pass text = "sjbrfqmw" and choose a to_remove character that does not appear in that text (e.g., "x"). Then the if condition is false and the function returns the original text unchanged.

Therefore:
- text = "sjbrfqmw"
- to_remove = "x"
