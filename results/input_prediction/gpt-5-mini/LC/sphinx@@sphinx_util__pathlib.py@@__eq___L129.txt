[THOUGHT]
We need __eq__ to produce False.

Looking at the code:
- If other is a PurePath, it returns super().__eq__(other) — that can be False if the paths differ.
- If other is a str, it warns and returns self.__str__() == other — that will be False if the string doesn't match the path string of self.
- Otherwise it returns NotImplemented (which would lead to False at the call site if no other fallback exists), but returning NotImplemented is not the same as returning False directly.

The simplest clear choice is to pass a str that does not equal the string form of the _StrPath instance. That triggers the str branch, a deprecation warning (not shown in the output), and returns False.

So set other to a non-matching string, e.g. "/tmp/something_else".
