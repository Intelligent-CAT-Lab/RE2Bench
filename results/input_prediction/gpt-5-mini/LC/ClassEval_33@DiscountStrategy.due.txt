[THOUGHT]
The due() method returns self.__total - discount. If promotion is None then discount = 0, so due() simply returns self.__total.

Given output 139.5, the simplest matching input is to set _DiscountStrategy__total to 139.5 and promotion to null. customer and cart aren't used by due(), so they can be arbitrary valid values (I'll supply a name and fidelity and an empty cart). args and kwargs are empty.
