[THOUGHT]
The function returns [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:], so the output list elements correspond to i * xs[i] for i = 1,2,3,4,...

We need:
1 * xs[1] = 2  => xs[1] = 2
2 * xs[2] = 2  => xs[2] = 1
3 * xs[3] = 0  => xs[3] = 0
4 * xs[4] = 16 => xs[4] = 4

xs[0] is not used in the output (index 0 is dropped), so it can be any value. Choose 0 for simplicity.

Thus xs = [0, 2, 1, 0, 4].
