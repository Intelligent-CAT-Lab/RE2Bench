[THOUGHT]
1. The __invert__ method returns self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form)).
2. To get a returned object with "_array_form": null, the argument to _af_new must be None, so _af_invert(self._array_form) should be None. The simplest way is self._array_form == None.
3. The returned object has "_size": 5, which implies the permutation size is 5 (usually coming from self._size).
4. Therefore the input self should have _array_form = None and _size = 5. No args or kwargs are used.
