The function returns K.sum(dup_abs(f, K)) when f is non-empty. dup_abs returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f], so the result is K.sum([K.abs(c) for c in f]) which (with a standard Domain) equals sum(abs(c) for c in f).

We need that sum(abs(c) for c in f) == 3.

A simple choice is f = [1, -2], since abs(1) + abs(-2) = 1 + 2 = 3.

K must be a Domain-like object whose zero is 0, whose abs method returns absolute value, and whose sum method sums an iterable starting from K.zero. Representing that domain minimally as a JSON object with zero = 0 and indicating use of the builtin abs and sum is enough for this prediction.

So:
- f = [1, -2]
- K.zero = 0 (and K provides abs and sum behaving as described)
