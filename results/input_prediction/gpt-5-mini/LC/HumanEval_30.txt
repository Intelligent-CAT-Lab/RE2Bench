[THOUGHT]
The function returns [e for e in l if e > 0], i.e., it keeps every element of l that is greater than 0.
To obtain the output [4, 5, 6], the input list must contain 4, 5, and 6, and it must not contain any other positive numbers (otherwise they'd appear in the output).
The simplest such input is exactly l = [4, 5, 6].
