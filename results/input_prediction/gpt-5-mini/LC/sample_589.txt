[THOUGHT]
The function appends the last element of the input list to itself and returns the list. The final output is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1], which means the original list must have been the same but without the final duplicated element. Therefore the input must have been [-70, 20, 9, 1]. Calling f on that list appends 1 (the last element) producing [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
