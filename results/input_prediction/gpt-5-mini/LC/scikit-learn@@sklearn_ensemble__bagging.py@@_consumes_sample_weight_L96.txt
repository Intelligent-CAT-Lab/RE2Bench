[THOUGHT]
We need _consumes_sample_weight(estimator) to return false.

The function does:
- If _routing_enabled() is True, it queries get_routing_for_object(estimator) and calls .consumes('fit', ('sample_weight',)). That could return an empty set (falsy), but to keep it simple we assume routing is disabled (the default is False), so the else branch runs.
- In the else branch it returns has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight') which is:
    hasattr(estimator, "fit") and 'sample_weight' in signature(estimator.fit).parameters

To get False, it's enough that the estimator does not have a fit attribute. A simple JSON representation that maps to a Python object without a fit attribute is an empty dict ({}). hasattr({}, "fit") is False, so has_fit_parameter returns False and thus the function returns False.

Therefore choose estimator = {}.
