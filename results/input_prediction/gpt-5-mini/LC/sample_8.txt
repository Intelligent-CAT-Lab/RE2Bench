[THOUGHT]
The function returns the input string unchanged when encryption == 0. If encryption != 0, it would attempt to call string.upper().encode('rot13'), which would produce bytes (or an encoding error), not the given string. The observed output is the string "UppEr", so the function must have taken the encryption == 0 branch and returned the original string. Therefore the input string is "UppEr" and encryption is 0.
