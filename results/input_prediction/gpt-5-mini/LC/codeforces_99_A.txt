[THOUGHT]
The code splits the input on '.' into num[0] and num[1].

- To get the printed output 2 the program must take the elif branch which prints f'{int(num[0]) + 1}' (the first branch prints a text string, the else branch would print num[0]).
- For the elif branch to run, the first if must be false: int(num[0][-1]) != 9. So the last digit of num[0] must not be '9'.
- And the elif condition int(num[1][0]) >= 5 must be true: the first character of the part after the dot must be '5', '6', '7', '8' or '9'.
- To have int(num[0]) + 1 equal 2, int(num[0]) must be 1, so num[0] should be "1" (or equivalent).
- The simplest satisfying input is "1.5": num[0] = "1" (int 1, last digit 1 != 9) and num[1][0] = '5' (>=5), so the program prints '2'.

Therefore the input string is "1.5".
