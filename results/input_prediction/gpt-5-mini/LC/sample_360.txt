[THOUGHT]
The function returns text unchanged whenever len(text) <= 2. The output is "g", which is length 1, so the simplest possibility is that the function took the early return and returned the input text "g". The value of n is irrelevant in that branch, so any integer is valid. I'll choose n = 0.
