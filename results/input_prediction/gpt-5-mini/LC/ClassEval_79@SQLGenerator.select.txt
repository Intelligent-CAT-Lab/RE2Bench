[THOUGHT]
The select method uses fields='*' when fields is None and appends " WHERE {condition}" if condition is provided. The output has "FROM table1" and "WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", so self.table_name must be "table1" and condition must be the string "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20". No positional args were used (fields left as None).
