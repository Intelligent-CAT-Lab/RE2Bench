[THOUGHT]
The function returns elements between two planet names from the ordered tuple planet_names. It returns:
- () (empty tuple) if either planet name is invalid or both names are equal, or
- a slice of planet_names between the two indices (exclusive). A slice can also be empty when the planets are adjacent in order.

We need an input that leads to an empty result. Choose two adjacent valid planets so the slice is empty but inputs are valid strings. For example:
- planet_names index: Mercury(0), Venus(1), Earth(2), Mars(3), ...
- If planet1 = "Earth" (index 2) and planet2 = "Mars" (index 3), then planet1_index < planet2_index and the function returns planet_names[3:3], which is an empty tuple. The JSON output shows an empty list for that empty tuple.

Therefore use planet1 = "Earth" and planet2 = "Mars".
