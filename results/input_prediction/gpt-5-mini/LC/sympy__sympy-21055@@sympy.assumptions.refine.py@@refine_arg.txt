[THOUGHT]
1. The function refine_arg gets rg = expr.args[0].
2. It returns S.Zero (which is printed as "0") only when ask(Q.positive(rg), assumptions) is True.
3. Therefore the assumptions provided must imply rg is positive.
4. A minimal/clear choice is to let rg be the symbol "x" (i.e., expr.args = ("x",)) and set the assumptions so that Q.positive(x) is True.
5. So set expr.nargs._args_set to ["x"] and assumptions to {"Q.positive(x)": true} so ask(Q.positive(rg), assumptions) will evaluate to True and the function returns 0.
