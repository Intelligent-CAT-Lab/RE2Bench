[THOUGHT]
We need f(d) to return {"87": 7, "18": 6}. The function picks the two largest keys (by key string, reverse lexicographic order) from the input dict d and returns a new dict with those two keys and their popped values.

Therefore the input dict must contain the keys "87" and "18" with values 7 and 6 respectively (and any third key/value for the remaining placeholder). To ensure the function returns exactly those two pairs, include "87": 7 and "18": 6 in d. The third key can be any other key (I include "2": 0).

So the input used for f should be a dict with keys "87", "18", and one other key; here I use "2": 0 as the third item.
