[THOUGHT]
We need an input array that, after running f, results in []. The function only performs removals when -1, 0, or 1 are present. If the input array is empty, none of the while conditions (-1 in array, 0 in array, 1 in array) are true, so no pops occur and the function returns the original array, which is [].
Therefore the simplest valid input is array = [].
