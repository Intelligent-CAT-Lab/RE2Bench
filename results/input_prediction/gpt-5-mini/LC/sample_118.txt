[THOUGHT]
The function does two replacement passes:
- First it sets extra_chars = chars and does text = text.replace(chars, '').
- Second it sets extra_chars = chars + chars and does text = text.replace(chars+chars, '').

If the provided output is "zbzquiuqnmfkx", an easy way to get that result is to pass the same string as text and choose a chars value that does not appear in the text. Then both replacements remove nothing and the function returns the original text unchanged.

For example, choose chars = "a" (there is no "a" in "zbzquiuqnmfkx"):
- After first pass extra_chars = "a", text.replace("a", "") does nothing.
- After second pass extra_chars = "aa", text.replace("aa", "") does nothing.
- The function returns "zbzquiuqnmfkx".

Thus a valid input is text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" and chars = "a".
