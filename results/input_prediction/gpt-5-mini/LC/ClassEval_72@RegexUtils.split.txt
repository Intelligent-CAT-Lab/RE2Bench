[THOUGHT]
We need pattern and text such that re.split(pattern, text) returns ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].

re.split splits the text at each match of pattern and returns the substrings between matches. Empty strings at the start and end mean the text begins and ends with the separator pattern (i.e., the pattern matches at the very beginning and at the very end).

A simple choice is a single-character separator, for example "x". If text is "x abiguygusu x kjgufwycs x", splitting on "x" gives:
- before first 'x' → "" (empty)
- between first and second 'x' → " abiguygusu "
- between second and third 'x' → " kjgufwycs "
- after last 'x' → "" (empty)

That exactly matches the provided output list.
