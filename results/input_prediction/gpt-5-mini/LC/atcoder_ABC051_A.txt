[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single string via input() and prints input().replace(',', ' ').

To produce the output "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc", the input after replacing all commas with spaces must equal that string.

One simple input that yields this output is to have commas where the output has spaces: "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc". Replacing each comma with a space produces "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc", which matches the given output.
