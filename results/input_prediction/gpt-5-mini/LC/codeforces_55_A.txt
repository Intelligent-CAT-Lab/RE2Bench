[THOUGHT]
The program reads an integer n.
If n is odd and not 1, the while loop (n % 2 == 0) is skipped and the final check n == 1 fails, so it prints "NO".

Choose a simple odd integer not equal to 1, e.g. 3.

Simulation:
- n = int(input()) -> n = 3
- while n % 2 == 0 -> 3 % 2 == 1 -> loop skipped
- if n == 1 -> 3 == 1 is False -> prints "NO"
