[THOUGHT]
The program reads three integers N, A, B from a single line.

Computation:
ans = (N // (A + B)) * A
rem = N % (A + B)
ans += min(rem, A)
print(ans)

We need the printed result to be 0.

A simple choice: N = 0 with A = 1 and B = 1.
- A + B = 2 (non-zero, so no division error)
- N // (A + B) = 0 // 2 = 0 -> ans = 0 * 1 = 0
- rem = 0 % 2 = 0
- min(rem, A) = min(0, 1) = 0
- Final ans = 0 + 0 = 0 -> prints 0

Therefore the input line "0 1 1" produces the given output.
