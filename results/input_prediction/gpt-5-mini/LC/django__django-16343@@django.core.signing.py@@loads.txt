[THOUGHT]
We need an input s such that loads(s, ...) returns the Python dict {"a": "dictionary"}.

The loads function is a thin wrapper around TimestampSigner(...).unsign_object(s, serializer=JSONSerializer, max_age=...). That means unsign_object is expected to take a signed string and return the original object (using the JSONSerializer). The simplest, and most plausible, input that would deserialize to {"a": "dictionary"} is the JSON representation of that object. If the signer accepts raw JSON (or if unsign_object falls back to deserializing when no signature is found), the JSON string '{"a": "dictionary"}' will deserialize to the desired dict.

Therefore, provide s as the JSON string '{"a": "dictionary"}'. The rest of the structure stays empty as specified.
