[THOUGHT]
The function returns True only when all three arguments are ints and one of them is the sum of the other two (x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x).

So I need integer values satisfying that relation. A simple choice is x=1, y=2, z=3 because 1 + 2 == 3 and all are ints. This will make the function return True.
