[THOUGHT]
The function flips case: uppercase letters -> lowercase in output, and non-uppercase (lowercase or non-letters) -> output gets text[i].upper(). To recover input, invert that transformation:

Given output ",WpZpPPDL/":

- ',' is punctuation => input must be ',', because punctuation.upper() == punctuation.
- 'W' is uppercase => it came from a lowercase 'w' in the input.
- 'p' is lowercase => it came from an uppercase 'P' in the input.
- 'Z' -> came from 'z'
- 'p' -> came from 'P'
- 'P' -> came from 'p'
- 'P' -> came from 'p'
- 'D' -> came from 'd'
- 'L' -> came from 'l'
- '/' punctuation -> input '/'

So the input string is ",wPzPppdl/".
