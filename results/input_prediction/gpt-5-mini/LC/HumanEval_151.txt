[THOUGHT]
The function sums i**2 for items i that meet all of:
- i > 0
- i % 2 != 0 (odd)
- '.' not in str(i) (string representation has no decimal point → excludes floats like 3.0)

To get output 0, no list elements can satisfy all three conditions. The simplest input that guarantees this is an empty list (no items to include), which yields sum([]) == 0.
