[THOUGHT]
We need other * self.n == -1 and self.month == 2 (since returned object's month is copied from self.month). Also other must not be a float (otherwise the method would return NotImplemented).

Choose simple integers:
- Let self.n = 1 and other = -1. Then isinstance(other, float) is False, and other * self.n = -1 * 1 = -1.
- self.month = 2 gives the returned object's month = 2.

This yields the returned object type(self)(n=-1, month=2), matching the provided output.
