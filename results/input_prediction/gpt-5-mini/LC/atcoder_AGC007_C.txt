I'll simulate the program algebraically.

The code reads three Decimals n, d, x. The loop computes:
  C = d + x * (2*n - 1) / 2   (this is independent of i)
and
  ans = C * sum_{i=1..n} (n - i + 1) / i

The sum simplifies to:
  sum_{i=1..n} (n - i + 1)/i = (n+1) * H_n - n
where H_n is the nth harmonic number.

So
  ans = (d + x*(2*n - 1)/2) * ((n+1)*H_n - n)

We are given ans = 5655984170796.687 (≈5.65598e12). For large n,
  (n+1)*H_n - n ≈ n*(ln n + gamma - 1)  (gamma is Euler's constant ≈0.5772)

Solving roughly for n from n^2*(ln n + const) ≈ 5.656e12 gives n on the order of 6.6e5. Iterating estimates puts n around 660000.

With n = 660000 we get ((n+1)*H_n - n) ≈ 8,564,973.579... (approx). Then
  C = ans / that_sum ≈ 660362.5 (approx).

C equals d + x*(2*n -1)/2. For n = 660000, (2*n - 1)/2 = 659999.5. Choosing x = 1 gives
  d ≈ C - 659999.5 ≈ 363 (approximately).

So a simple integer triple that matches the approximate solution is:
  n = 660000, d = 363, x = 1

This triple produces an ans close to the given 5655984170796.687, and uses simple integer inputs consistent with the program's expected input format.
