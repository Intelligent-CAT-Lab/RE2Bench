[THOUGHT]
The program sets j = n*n and starts i = 1, printing pairs (i, j) while i < j, incrementing i and decrementing j each loop.

The first printed pair is "1 64", so n*n = 64 => n = 8.
With n = 8, j starts at 64 and the loop will print pairs from (1,64) up to (32,33), which matches the provided output exactly.
Therefore the input given to the program was "8".
