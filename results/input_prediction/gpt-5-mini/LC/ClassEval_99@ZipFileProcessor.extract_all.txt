[THOUGHT]
The extract_all method returns False only if an exception is raised inside the try block (opening the zip or extracting). The simplest way to cause an exception is to provide a file_name that does not exist (raising FileNotFoundError when zipfile.ZipFile tries to open it). The output_path value can be any string; it won't be used because the exception happens before extractall is called. Therefore a plausible input is a non-existent zip file name and some output path.
