We need inputs that produce binary_log_loss(...) == 3.4222022694919696.

For a single sample with y_true=1, the loss is -log(y_prob). So to get loss L = 3.4222022694919696, pick y_prob = exp(-L). Using y_prob = np.exp(-3.4222022694919696) makes the returned loss exactly 3.4222022694919696 (up to floating-point rounding).

So choose a single-element array y_true = [1.0], y_prob = [exp(-3.4222022694919696)] (approximately 0.032640632924), and leave sample_weight as null.
