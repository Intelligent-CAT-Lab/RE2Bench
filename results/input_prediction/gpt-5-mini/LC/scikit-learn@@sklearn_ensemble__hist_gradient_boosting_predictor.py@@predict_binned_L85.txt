[THOUGHT]
1. The produced output array has 5 elements, so out.shape[0] == 5. predict_binned creates out with length equal to X.shape[0]. Therefore X must have 5 rows.
2. The exact values of nodes and the two bitsets are not inferable from the output alone. For a valid (plausible) call, they can be minimal placeholders (empty lists / nulls). The C/compiled helper would normally consume structured arrays, but here we only need to supply a consistent input that matches the output shape.
3. missing_values_bin_idx can be -1 (commonly used to indicate no missing bin), and n_threads can be 1.
4. Choose a simple binned X with shape (5, 1), e.g. [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4]] to match 5 rows.

So the predicted inputs:
- nodes: []
- binned_left_cat_bitsets: null
- raw_left_cat_bitsets: null
- X: [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4]]
- missing_values_bin_idx: -1
- n_threads: 1
