[THOUGHT]
The function returns number % 1.0, i.e., the fractional part of number in [0, 1). The observed output 0.33000000000000007 is the floating-point representation of the decimal 0.33. The simplest input whose fractional part gives that output is 0.33 (other possibilities like 1.33, -0.67, etc. would also yield the same fractional part, but 0.33 is the minimal straightforward choice).
