[THOUGHT]
The function returns all input strings that contain the given substring. The output contains "grunt" and "prune", so the substring must appear in both words. Common substrings include "r", "ru", "run", "un", etc. Choosing a specific, meaningful substring that appears in both (and is more than a single character) — for example "run" — fits: "grunt" contains "run" and "prune" contains "run". The simplest input that produces the given output is to pass strings = ["grunt", "prune"] and substring = "run".
