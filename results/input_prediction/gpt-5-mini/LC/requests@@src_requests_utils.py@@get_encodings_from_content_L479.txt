[THOUGHT]
1. The function compiles three regexes and returns the concatenation of their findall results:
   - charset_re finds patterns like <meta ... charset="ENC" ...>
   - pragma_re finds <meta ... content="...;charset=ENC" ...>
   - xml_re finds <?xml ... encoding="ENC" ...>
2. To get a single result "UTF-8" in the output list, provide content that matches one of those regexes and captures "UTF-8".
3. The simplest is an HTML meta tag using the charset attribute, e.g. '<meta charset="UTF-8">'.
4. That will make charset_re.findall(content) == ["UTF-8"], and the other two findall calls return [], so the final returned list is ["UTF-8"]. (The DeprecationWarning is emitted but doesn't affect the return value.)
