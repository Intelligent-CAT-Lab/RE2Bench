[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d from the input. It computes length = max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)) and prints that.

To get output 0, we need min(b, d) - max(a, c) <= 0. For example, with input "1 2 3 4":
- a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4
- min(b, d) = min(2, 4) = 2
- max(a, c) = max(1, 3) = 3
- min(b,d) - max(a,c) = 2 - 3 = -1
- max(0, -1) = 0, which matches the given output.

So the input can be "1 2 3 4".
