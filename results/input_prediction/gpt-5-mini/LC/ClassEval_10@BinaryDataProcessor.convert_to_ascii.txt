[THOUGHT]
The convert_to_ascii method takes self.binary_string, reads it in 8-bit chunks, converts each chunk from base-2 to an integer, appends as a byte, and decodes the bytearray as ASCII to produce the output "hebo".

We find the ASCII codes:
- 'h' = 104 -> binary 01101000
- 'e' = 101 -> binary 01100101
- 'b' = 98  -> binary 01100010
- 'o' = 111 -> binary 01101111

Concatenate the 8-bit groups in order to form the binary_string:
"01101000011001010110001001101111"

So self.binary_string should be that concatenated bit string. args and kwargs are empty.
