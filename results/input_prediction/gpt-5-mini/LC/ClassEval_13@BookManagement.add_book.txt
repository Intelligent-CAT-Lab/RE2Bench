[THOUGHT]
The add_book method has no return statement, so it always returns None (null in JSON). Any valid call would produce the given output. I'll choose a plausible initial inventory and a call that increments an existing book's quantity using the default quantity=1. For example, start with "book1": 2 and "book2": 3, and call add_book with title "book1" (no kwargs). After the call, "book1" would become 3, and the function still returns None.
