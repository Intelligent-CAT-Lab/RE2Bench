[THOUGHT]
The code sorts the characters of the input string and then checks:
- s[0] == s[1] (first two sorted characters equal)
- s[2] == s[3] (next two sorted characters equal)
- s[0] != s[2] (the pair values are different)

So the sorted character list must be like ['x','x','y','y', ...] with x != y. The minimal simple input producing that is "aabb" (or any permutation like "abab" or "bbaa"), since sorted("aabb") -> ['a','a','b','b'] and the condition is satisfied, printing "Yes". I'll use "aabb".

    "input": "aabb"
