[THOUGHT]
The function returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f] and the observed output is [2] — a one-element list with value 2.

Thus:
- f must be an iterable with exactly one coefficient.
- For that coefficient c, K.abs(c) must equal 2.

The simplest choice is to pick the coefficient c = -2 and let K.abs perform an absolute-value operation (abs(-2) == 2). We don't need to supply an actual callable object here; the structure only requires a representation of K with an abs attribute. So set f = [-2] and K = {"abs": "abs"} to indicate a domain whose abs returns the absolute value.
