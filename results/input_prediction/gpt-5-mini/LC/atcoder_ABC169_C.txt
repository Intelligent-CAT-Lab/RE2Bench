[THOUGHT]
We need a and b so that int(a) * int(b[0] + b[2:]) // 100 == 2017634310362021.

A simple way is to make int(b[0]+b[2:]) = 100, then the expression becomes int(a)*100//100 = int(a), so set int(a) = 2017634310362021.

We need an original second token b whose first character plus everything from index 2 onward equals "100". For example b = "1100": b[0] = "1", b[2:] = "00", so b[0] + b[2:] = "100".

Thus the input string can be "2017634310362021 1100".
