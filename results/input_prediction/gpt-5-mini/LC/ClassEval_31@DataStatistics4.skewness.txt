[THOUGHT]
The function returns 0 when std_deviation == 0 because of the conditional "if std_deviation != 0 else 0". std_deviation is 0 when all data points are identical.

Pick a simple example where all elements are equal, e.g. data = [1, 1, 1]:
- n = 3
- mean = (1+1+1)/3 = 1
- variance = sum((x-mean)^2)/n = 0
- std_deviation = 0 -> triggers the else branch and returns 0

This avoids any potential division-by-zero from (n-1)*(n-2) for small n when std_deviation != 0.
