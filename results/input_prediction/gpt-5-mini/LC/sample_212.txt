[THOUGHT]
Function f reverses the list len(nums)-1 times. If len(nums)-1 is even, the list ends up in the original order; if odd, it ends up reversed.

The output list has length 7. If the input list also has length 7, the loop runs 6 times (7-1 = 6), which is even, so the final list equals the original input. Therefore the input must be the same as the given output.
