[THOUGHT]
The function copies the input list, reverses it (which returns an iterator over the elements in reverse order), then returns the list of squares of those reversed elements.

The output squares are [1, 4, 1], so the reversed iteration produced values whose squares are 1, 2^2, 1. Those values could be ±1, ±2, ±1, but the simplest choice is positive integers.

If the reversed sequence was [1, 2, 1], then the original array (before reversing) must be the reverse of that, which for a palindrome is the same: [1, 2, 1]. That input yields the given output.
