[THOUGHT]
The program prints 0.5 for even N, but the output 0.5050505050505051 ≠ 0.5, so N is odd.
For odd N the program prints (N+1)/N/2 = 0.5 + 1/(2N).
Let output = 0.5050505050505051 = 0.5 + 1/(2N).
Subtract 0.5: 0.005050505050505096 = 1/(2N) which equals 1/198, so 2N = 198 and N = 99.
Thus the input provided to the program must be "99".
