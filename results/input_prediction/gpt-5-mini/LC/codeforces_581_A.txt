[THOUGHT]
The program:
- Reads a single line, splits into tokens, converts them to ints in list x.
- Sets a = x[0], b = x[1].
- Prints min(x) and then either abs(a-b)//2 if abs(a-b) >= 2, otherwise 0.

Given output "1 0":
- min(x) must be 1.
- The second printed value is 0, so abs(a-b) < 2 (i.e., 0 or 1).

Possible simple inputs satisfying these are "1 1" (a=b=1, abs=0) or "1 2"/"2 1" (abs=1, min=1). The simplest is "1 1", which yields min(x)=1 and prints 0 for the second value.
