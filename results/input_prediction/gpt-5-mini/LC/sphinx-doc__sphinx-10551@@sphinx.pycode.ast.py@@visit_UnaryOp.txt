[THOUGHT]
1. The function visit_UnaryOp returns '%s%s' % (self.visit(node.op), self.visit(node.operand)) when the operator is not ast.Not, and '%s %s' with a space if it is ast.Not.
2. The observed output is "~1" (no space). Therefore the code path without the space was taken, so node.op is not ast.Not.
3. To produce "~1" we need:
   - self.visit(node.op) -> "~"
   - self.visit(node.operand) -> "1"
4. The operator that corresponds to "~" is the ast.Invert operator, so node.op should be an Invert operator node (the structure's "op" field is left as an object).
5. The operand must be a numeric literal with value 1. In the typed AST this is represented with a Constant (or Num-like) node having value 1 and kind null/None, and reasonable lineno/col positions.
6. Also set self.code to the source string "~1" (typical for an Unparse visitor).
7. Fill other lineno/col fields with plausible values (1, 0, 2, etc.) that match the single-token expression.

Based on this reasoning, construct the input where:
- self.code = "~1"
- node.op is an (Invert) operator (kept as an empty object in the provided structure)
- node.operand has value 1, kind null, lineno/col offsets set to plausible integers
- node lineno/col fields set similarly
