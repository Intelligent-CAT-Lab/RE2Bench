[THOUGHT]
The function returns y if n == 1 or if any i in range(2, n) divides n (i.e., n is composite). Otherwise (no divisors found) it returns x, which happens when n is a prime greater than 1.

To get output 3, either x must be 3 and n must be prime (>1), or y must be 3 and n must be 1 or composite.

I'll choose a simple prime case: n = 5 (prime), x = 3, y = 2. For n=5 the loop checks i=2,3,4 none divide 5, so the function returns x which is 3.
