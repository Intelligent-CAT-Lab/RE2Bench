[THOUGHT]
The add_event method appends the provided event to self.events and does not return anything, so the function returns None which is represented as null in the output. The observed output {"output": null} only tells us the method returned None; it doesn't constrain the event contents or the prior events list.

A reasonable prediction is that the CalendarUtil instance started with an empty events list (as set in __init__) and an event dict with typical fields. I'll pick the current date (2025-12-24) and a simple time range and description for the event. The kwargs are empty because the method signature uses a single positional parameter.

So the input will have self.events as an empty list and the event with date "2025-12-24", start_time "10:00", end_time "11:00", description "Team meeting".
