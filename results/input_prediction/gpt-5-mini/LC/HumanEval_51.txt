[THOUGHT]
The function removes all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) case-insensitively from the input text. The given output is:

"bcdf\nghjklm"

This is two lines: first line "bcdf", second line "ghjklm".

We need an input string that, after removing vowels, yields those lines.

- To get "bcdf" from the first line, a simple original is "abcdef": removing 'a' and 'e' gives "bcdf".
- To get "ghjklm" from the second line, a simple original is "ghijklmo": removing 'i' and 'o' gives "ghjklm".

Combine the two lines with a newline: "abcdef\nghijklmo". This input, when passed to remove_vowels, returns the given output.
