[THOUGHT]
The method withdraw_resume calls self.resumes.remove(resume) and returns None (output null), which means no exception occurred and the resume was successfully removed. For remove to succeed, the resume argument must exactly match (by equality) an entry in self.resumes. job_listings is irrelevant to the operation.

So the input must have self.resumes containing the same resume object (dictionary) provided in args.resume. I'll provide a simple resume dictionary (name, skills list, experience int) and include that same dict inside self.resumes. kwargs is empty.
