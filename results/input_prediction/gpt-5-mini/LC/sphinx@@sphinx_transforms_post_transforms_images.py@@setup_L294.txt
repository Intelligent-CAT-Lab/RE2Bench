[THOUGHT]
1. The function setup(app) calls app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader) and app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor) and then returns the fixed metadata dict:
   {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}
2. To produce that output, the only requirement on the input is that app has an add_post_transform attribute (callable). The exact behavior of add_post_transform doesn't affect the returned dict.
3. Represent the app as an object with an add_post_transform placeholder. Following the example style, I'll use an object with an "add_post_transform" field (an empty object as a placeholder).
4. self and kwargs are empty as per the structure.
