[THOUGHT]
1. __eq__ returns True only if other is an instance of CheckConstraint and all compared fields are equal: name, check, violation_error_code, and violation_error_message.
2. To get True, set "other" to have exactly the same values as "self" for those fields.
3. For simplicity, choose a straightforward check value: children as an empty list, connector as "AND", negated as false. Use name "c1", violation_error_code as null, and violation_error_message proxy args as ["violation"] with empty kw.
4. Fill both self and other with those identical values and leave kwargs empty.
