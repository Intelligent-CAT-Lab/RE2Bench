[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d and prints the maximum of the pairwise products a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d. To get output 56183721947132200, choose values so one of these products equals that number and the others are no larger.

A simple choice: a = 1, b = 0, c = 56183721947132200, d = 0.
Then a*c = 1 * 56183721947132200 = 56183721947132200, and the other products are zero, so the printed max matches the given output.
