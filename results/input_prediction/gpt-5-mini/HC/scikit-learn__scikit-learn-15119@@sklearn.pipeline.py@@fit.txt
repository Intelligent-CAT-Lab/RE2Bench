[THOUGHT]
We need the inputs to FeatureUnion.fit that produce the shown output dict of the instance state:
{
    "transformer_list": null,
    "n_jobs": null,
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "verbose": false
}

FeatureUnion.fit returns self (the instance) unchanged when there are no transformers to run (the call to _parallel_func yields an empty list). The simplest instance state matching the output is that the instance attributes transformer_list, n_jobs, transformer_weights are None and verbose is False. The fit call's X and y can be None (no data needed because there are no transformers), and any extra kwargs can be None as well.

Therefore the input object ("self") should have those attributes set to None/False, and fit should be called with X=None, y=None and kwargs {"a": None}.
