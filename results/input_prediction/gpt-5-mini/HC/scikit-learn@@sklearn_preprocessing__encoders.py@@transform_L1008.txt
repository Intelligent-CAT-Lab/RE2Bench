[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a CSR matrix with 2 stored elements and shape (2, 2). That implies n_samples = 2 and total output features = 2, and only 2 nonzero entries total (so one nonzero per row).
2. In transform(), out is constructed from X_int, X_mask and _n_features_outs:
   - feature_indices[-1] = sum(_n_features_outs) must be 2. The simplest choice is _n_features_outs = [1, 1] (two input features each producing 1 one-hot column).
   - n_samples must be 2, so X_int and X_mask will be 2x2.
   - To have exactly 1 valid (True) entry per row, choose X_mask = [[True, False], [False, True]].
   - indices are computed as (X_int + feature_indices[:-1]).ravel()[mask]. With feature_indices[:-1] == [0,1], if X_int is [[0,0],[0,0]] then the masked indices become [0,1] producing two stored elements at columns 0 and 1.
3. How to get X_int=[[0,0],[0,0]] while having X_mask with the pattern above: _transform marks rows as invalid (mask False) where an entry is an unknown category. It then replaces those unknown entries with categories_[i][0] before encoding, resulting in 0 encoded value but masked out. Therefore:
   - Set categories_ = [ [0], [0] ] (each feature only accepts category 0).
   - Provide input X such that feature 0 column is [0,1] (so second row unknown), and feature 1 column is [1,0] (so first row unknown). So X = [[0,1],[1,0]].
   - Set handle_unknown to 'ignore' (not 'error') so unknowns are tolerated and lead to mask False rather than raising.
4. Ensure check_is_fitted passes: check_is_fitted looks for attributes ending with underscore; categories_ exists, so it's considered fitted.
5. Other attributes: sparse_output must be True to return a sparse matrix; dtype should be float64 to match output dtype.
6. Set _drop_idx_after_grouping = None to avoid additional adjustments.

Putting this together yields the input below.
