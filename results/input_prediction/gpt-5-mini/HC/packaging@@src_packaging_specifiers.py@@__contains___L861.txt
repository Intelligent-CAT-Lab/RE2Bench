[THOUGHT]
1. __contains__ simply calls contains(item) with prereleases=None, installed=None.
2. contains calls _coerce_version(item). To return True we need this to be non-None; using a normal version string like "1.2.3" will coerce successfully.
3. contains then returns bool(list(self.filter([version], prereleases=None))).
4. In filter, because prereleases is None and self.prereleases is not None, prereleases becomes self.prereleases.
5. With no specifiers (self._specs empty) and prereleases True, filter returns an iterator over the input iterable unchanged, so the list will be non-empty and bool(...) is True.
6. Therefore set _specs to an empty collection and _prereleases to true, and use "1.2.3" as the item.
