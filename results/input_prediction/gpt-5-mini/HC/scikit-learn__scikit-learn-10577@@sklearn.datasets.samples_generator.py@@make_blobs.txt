1. From the provided output, the second array (labels) contains 50 integers (values 0,1,2). Therefore n_samples = 50.
2. Each sample in the first array has two coordinates => n_features = 2.
3. Labels are 0,1,2, so there are 3 centers. Observing the coordinates:
   - Points labeled 0 are clustered near (0,0).
   - Points labeled 1 are clustered near (1,1).
   - Points labeled 2 are clustered near (0,1).
   This matches the common centers = [[0,0], [1,1], [0,1]] ordering.
4. cluster_std is a scalar (all clusters show similar spread). Visual spread suggests a moderate standard deviation (around 0.2–0.4). A typical example uses cluster_std ≈ 0.3.
5. A fixed random_state was used to produce the exact arrays; a common reproducible choice is random_state = 0.
6. The function call therefore most likely used:
   - n_samples = 50
   - n_features = 2
   - centers = [[0,0], [1,1], [0,1]]
   - cluster_std = 0.3
   - random_state = 0

These inputs explain the shapes, cluster assignments, and numeric spread seen in the output arrays.
