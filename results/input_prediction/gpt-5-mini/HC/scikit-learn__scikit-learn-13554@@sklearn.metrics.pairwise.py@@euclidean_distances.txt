[THOUGHT]
1. The function euclidean_distances returns a 1x1 matrix [[1.1649954]]. That means X and Y after check_pairwise_arrays are 2D arrays with shapes (1, n_features) each (single sample each), and the Euclidean distance between those two vectors is 1.1649954 (since squared is likely False; the output is not squared).

2. For a single-sample case the returned value is sqrt(sum((X - Y)^2)). The simplest way to produce the exact distance 1.1649954 is to use 1-dimensional feature vectors (n_features=1) so the distance equals the absolute difference of scalars.

3. Choose X = [[0.0]] and Y = [[1.1649954]]. Then distance = |0.0 - 1.1649954| = 1.1649954, matching the output. squared should be False to match the non-squared returned value.

4. check_pairwise_arrays and check_array will accept these as valid 2D numeric arrays, so no other complications arise.

Thus the input is X=[[0.0]], Y=[[1.1649954]], squared=False.
