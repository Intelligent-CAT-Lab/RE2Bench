[THOUGHT]
1. We need the inputs to _eval_evalf(self, prec) that produce the string "-0.e-1" as output.
2. The numbers._eval_evalf implementation simply returns self (it ignores prec).
3. Therefore the returned object string "-0.e-1" must be the string representation of self itself — i.e., self is a numeric SymPy object that prints as "-0.e-1" (a negative zero Float with that exponent/precision representation).
4. Any prec value is acceptable because numbers._eval_evalf returns self unchanged; choose a small integer prec (1) for concreteness.
5. So the call is _eval_evalf(self=<number that prints as "-0.e-1">, prec=1). Represent self as the string "-0.e-1" to reflect that object/value.
