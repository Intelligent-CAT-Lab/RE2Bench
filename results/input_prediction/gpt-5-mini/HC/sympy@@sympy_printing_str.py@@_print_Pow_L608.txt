[THOUGHT]
1. The StrPrinter._print_Pow method returns "sqrt(%s)" % self._print(expr.base) only when expr.exp is S.Half and rational is False (the early special-case branch).
2. Therefore expr.exp must be S.Half and rational must be False.
3. To produce "sqrt(2)" the inner self._print(expr.base) must produce "2", so expr.base should be the integer 2 (a SymPy Integer would print as "2").
4. The printer settings can be the class defaults; _print_level can be 0. The exact identity of S.Half can be represented as the sentinel "S.Half" to indicate that the exponent is the SymPy half object.
5. Assemble the input with expr having base 2 and exp "S.Half", and rational False. Fill printer settings with their defaults.
