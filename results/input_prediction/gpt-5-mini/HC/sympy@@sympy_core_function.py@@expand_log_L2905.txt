[THOUGHT]
1. expand_log returns sympify(expr).expand(...). To get output "log(2)", the easiest input is already log(2) (a SymPy log object) so sympify/expand leave it as log(2).
2. The function, when factor is False, attempts to call expr.replace(...) where expr must be a SymPy Basic (so .replace is the SymPy replace, not str.replace). Therefore expr should represent the SymPy expression log(2).
3. Use the typical defaults: deep=True, force=False, factor=False (factor must be False to trigger the replacement branch as in the code).
4. The self parameter is unused and can be an empty object.

So the predicted input sets expr to log(2) and the booleans as above.
