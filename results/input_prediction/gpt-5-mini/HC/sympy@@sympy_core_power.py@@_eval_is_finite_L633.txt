[THOUGHT]
We need the function Pow._eval_is_finite to return None (JSON null). Looking at the code, that happens in multiple places where the function does an unconditional "return" with no value (i.e., returns None / falls through):

- If self.exp.is_negative is truthy, the function may return False or True (so not None).
- Otherwise it computes c1 = self.base.is_finite. If c1 is None, it immediately "return" (i.e., returns None).
- If c1 is not None it computes c2 = self.exp.is_finite, and if c2 is None it also "return" (None).
- There is a further path where both c1 and c2 are True but inner condition fails; that path is more involved to arrange.

The simplest, most direct way to get None is to make self.exp.is_negative be falsey (so the initial block is skipped) and have self.base.is_finite be None so execution hits "if c1 is None: return". Therefore set:

- self.exp.is_negative = False (or null) to skip the first block,
- self.base.is_finite = null to force the early return -> None.

No other attributes are required for this path. The args and kwargs are empty.

Given that, the input object is:
