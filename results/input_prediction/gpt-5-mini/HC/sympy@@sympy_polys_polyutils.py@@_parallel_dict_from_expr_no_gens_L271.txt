We need exprs and opt.fraction such that the function returns polys = [{(1,): 1}] and gens = (cos(phi),).

Step-by-step for expr = cos(phi):
- expr is not an Equality, so we process its Add.make_args -> term = cos(phi).
- For the term, Mul.make_args yields the single factor cos(phi).
- The coefficient list stays empty (cos(phi) is not treated as a numeric coefficient).
- We decompose the power: base = cos(phi), exp = 1, so elements = {cos(phi): 1} and gens adds cos(phi).
- After sorting gens we get tuple(gens) = (cos(phi),).
- When building the polynomial for this expression, monom with index of cos(phi) gets exponent 1 -> monom (1,), and coefficient is Mul(*coeff) -> 1 (since coeff is empty).
- Thus polys = [{(1,): 1}] and gens = (cos(phi),) which matches the provided output.

Opt settings don't affect this outcome for cos(phi); include fraction (set to False) as the only required opt field per the structure.

So the input is exprs = ["cos(phi)"] and opt.fraction = False.
