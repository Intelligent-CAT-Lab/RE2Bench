[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs to Term.mul that produce Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})).

Looking at mul:
- coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff. To get coeff == 1, simplest choice is self.coeff == 1 and other.coeff == 1.
- numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer). To get an empty Factors (Factors({})), both self.numer and other.numer should be empty Factors.
- denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom). To get an empty Factors, both self.denom and other.denom should be empty Factors.
- numer.normal(denom) with both empty Factors returns (Factors({}), Factors({})).

Therefore both operands should be Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})). Representing these as the same string form used in the output yields the required result.
