[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that cause delete_masked_points to return three elements:
- first: an array of length 10 with values [0.0, 0.05, ..., 0.45]
- second: an array of length 10 with values [0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95]
- third: null (i.e., None)

How the function works:
- nrecs = len(args[0]) determines the "record length".
- seqlist[i] is True only for arguments that are iterable and have length equal to nrecs.
- Masks are collected only for seqlist True entries; for MaskedArray, the code uses ~getmaskarray(x) (True where data is unmasked) and also checks np.isfinite on the data.
- If any masks exist, they are combined with logical_and.reduce to produce an overall boolean mask; igood = indices where mask True; if len(igood) < nrecs then all seqlist=True sequences are sliced to x[igood].
- Finally, any remaining MaskedArray entries that are seqlist True are filled (x.filled()).

To produce the observed result:
- Make args[0] be a MaskedArray of length 20 (nrecs = 20) with data values 0.00, 0.05, ..., 0.95 and with the last 10 entries masked. Then ~getmaskarray(x) yields True for indices 0..9 and False for 10..19, so igood will be indices 0..9 and margs[0] will be sliced to the first 10 values, and finally filled to a plain ndarray.
- Make args[1] be a sequence of length 10 with values 0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95. Because its length (10) != nrecs (20), seqlist[1] will be False and it will remain unchanged in the returned margs.
- Make args[2] be None so it stays as None in the returned margs (null in JSON).

Thus the function call was given three positional arguments:
1) a length-20 masked array with first 10 unmasked (0.00..0.45) and last 10 masked (0.50..0.95),
2) a length-10 sequence [0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95],
3) None.
