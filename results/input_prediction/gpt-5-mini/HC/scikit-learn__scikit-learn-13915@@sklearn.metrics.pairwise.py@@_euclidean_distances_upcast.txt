1. The function returns a distances array with 10 rows and 20 columns, so n_samples_X = 10 and n_samples_Y = 20. Thus X must have shape (10, n_features) and Y shape (20, n_features) for some n_features >= 1.
2. The implementation computes distances from X and Y (and computes XX and YY internally when they are None). The provided output is the computed distances matrix. From only the distances matrix, the original X and Y are not uniquely recoverable.
3. Given the information available, the safe deductions are:
   - X is an array with 10 rows.
   - Y is an array with 20 rows.
   - XX and YY were not provided to the function (so they should be null), since the code branches to compute XX_chunk and YY_chunk when XX or YY is None.
4. I therefore provide X and Y with the required row counts and a reasonable small feature dimension (3) using simple, deterministic values (so that the structure is fully specified). These specific numeric values are a valid input shape that the function accepts; they may not be the unique arrays that produced the shown output, but they satisfy all deduced constraints: X has 10 rows, Y has 20 rows, and XX/YY are null.

The chosen values:
- X: 10 rows, each row i is [i, i+0.1, i+0.2] for i = 0..9.
- Y: 20 rows, each row j is [0.5*j, 0.5*j + 0.1, 0.5*j + 0.2] for j = 0..19.
- XX: null
- YY: null
