We need an expr such that handle(expr) returns 1/(a - b).

- handle starts with n, d = fraction(expr).
- For expr = 1/(a - b), fraction(expr) gives n = 1 and d = a - b.
- The code checks several conditions; none cause an early return for this case.
- d.is_Add is True (a - b is an Add), so the main simplification loop runs but finds no radical terms (rterms yields a single group with root 1), so n and d remain unchanged.
- The function finally returns _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d) which for n = 1 and d = a - b is 1/(a - b).

Therefore the simplest input that produces the given output is the SymPy expression 1/(a - b). Representing this as a string in the JSON input: "1/(a - b)".
