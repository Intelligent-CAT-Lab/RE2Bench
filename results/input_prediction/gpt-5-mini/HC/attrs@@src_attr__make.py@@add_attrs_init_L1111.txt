[THOUGHT]
1. add_attrs_init builds an init script by calling _make_init_script(self._cls, ...), then appends a tuple (script, globs, _attach_attrs_init) to self._script_snippets and returns self.
2. The observed output "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>" is the string representation of the returned self, which implies that self._cls == "A".
3. Nothing in add_attrs_init changes self._cls, so to produce that output the input object must already be a _ClassBuilder with cls equal to "A". The provided structure only requires filling auto_attribs, these, and has_custom_setattr; these do not affect the fact that the method returns self whose repr shows cls=A.
4. I'll provide plausible values for those fields (e.g., auto_attribs False, these an empty list, has_custom_setattr False) while assuming the underlying builder's _cls is "A" as indicated by the output.
