[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to _preprocess that produce the returned pair (argstrs, expr) shown as [null, "sin(x)**2"].

Looking at the code, _preprocess returns (argstrs, expr). The second element is the expression after any possible substitutions; here it's "sin(x)**2". That means the input expr must already be sin(x)**2 (or an equivalent sympy expression) and no substitutions changed it.

_argstrs is built from the provided args. Typical usage is to pass argument symbols (e.g. x) and get a list of their string representations. The structure for self contains _dummify, _exprrepr, _argrepr; _argrepr and _exprrepr are placeholders (empty mappings) in the provided structure. We will set _dummify to False so the function will not force creation of Dummy objects. With args containing a single symbol "x" and expr "sin(x)**2", the method will iterate the args, treat the symbol as not iterable (strings are excluded by iterable()), use _argrepr to obtain a representation (placeholder here), and because dummify is False will append the string form of the argument. The expr remains unchanged.

Thus a reasonable input that yields the observed expr "sin(x)**2" is:
- self._dummify: False
- args.args: ["x"]
- args.expr: "sin(x)**2"
- leave _exprrepr and _argrepr as the given placeholders (empty maps), kwargs empty.

(Using the minimal placeholders in the structure; the harness that runs this expects these placeholders.)
