[THOUGHT]
We need inputs for the placeholders XXX only: expr and clockwise.

Looking at polytope_integrate, when given a 2D Polygon and a (non-list) expr it ends up calling main_integrate(expr, facets, hp_params), which for a constant expression returns the area of the polygon. The output "1/8" is the rational area 1/8.

Therefore a minimal, consistent input is:
- expr = 1 (constant integrand so the integral equals the polygon area),
- clockwise = False (ordering doesn't need to be clockwise; False is a valid boolean).

This corresponds to using a polygon whose area equals 1/8 (for example a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1/4)), but the poly value is not one of the placeholders we were asked to fill. So we set expr to 1 and clockwise to false.
