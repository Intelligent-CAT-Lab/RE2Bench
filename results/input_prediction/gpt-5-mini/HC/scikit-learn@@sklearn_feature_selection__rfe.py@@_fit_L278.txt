We need to find inputs to RFE._fit such that the returned object's representation is:
"RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1)".

- The string shown is the estimator's repr which reflects the RFE object's initialization parameters. So:
  - self.estimator must be an SVC with kernel='linear' (we represent it as "SVC(kernel='linear')" in the JSON).
  - self.n_features_to_select must be 4.
  - self.step must be 0.1.
  - importance_getter and verbose can be the typical defaults: "auto" and 0.

- _fit also requires valid X and y. validate_data will be called and expects X to be array-like shape (n_samples, n_features) and y length n_samples. To avoid warnings/errors:
  - Choose n_features >= n_features_to_select (so 8 features is fine).
  - Use a small dataset, e.g., 10 samples and 8 features, with y a binary label list of length 10.
  - step_score can be None.

These inputs will let _fit run (it will compute an internal integer step from step=0.1 and the n_features) and return self; its repr will match the provided output because the initialization parameters match.

Now provide the input JSON matching the required structure.
