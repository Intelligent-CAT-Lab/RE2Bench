[THOUGHT]
1. The simplify function starts with expr = sympify(expr). If I provide the string "1/(y*tanh(x))" sympify will produce the SymPy expression 1/(y*tanh(x)).
2. The rest of simplify performs many transformations but will leave 1/(y*tanh(x)) unchanged (it's already a simple rational form).
3. The provided output "1/(y*\"tanh(x)\")" is the JSON-escaped representation of 1/(y*tanh(x)) (the inner quotes around tanh(x) are from JSON encoding). Thus the simplest input that yields this output is the expression 1/(y*tanh(x)), supplied as a string to sympify.
