[THOUGHT]
We need an expression e and a symbol d such that _osbornei(e, d) returns "-I*tanh(x + I*z)".

The function replaces any TrigonometricFunction rv as follows:
- const, x_part = rv.args[0].as_independent(d, as_Add=True)
- a = x_part.xreplace({d: S.One}) + const * I
- for tan, it returns tanh(a) / I, which equals -I*tanh(a)

So we want a = x + I*z. To get that:
- const * I must be I*z, so const should be z (independent of d)
- x_part.xreplace({d:1}) must be x. A simple way is to make x_part equal to d*x (dependent on d); replacing d by 1 gives x.

Thus choose rv = tan(d*x + z) (order doesn't matter). With e = tan(d*x + z) and d being the symbol d (the second argument), f will compute a = (d*x).xreplace({d:1}) + z*I = x + I*z, and then return tanh(x + I*z)/I which is -I*tanh(x + I*z), matching the output.

So the input e should represent the expression tan(d*x + z). No other kwargs or self fields are needed.
