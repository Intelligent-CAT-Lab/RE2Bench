We need to find the input "self" such that after calling _expand_partial_derivative the observed output shows self._indices, self._free, self._dum are null.

Looking at _expand_partial_derivative:
- It calls self._contract_indices_for_derivative(...) and then creates obj = self.func(*args).
- It sets obj._indices = indices, obj._free = free, obj._dum = dum.
- It does not modify self._indices, self._free, or self._dum anywhere in this method.

Therefore the reported output (showing these three attributes as null) must reflect the input "self" already having those attributes set to None. There are no args or kwargs for this call.

So the input should have _indices: null, _free: null, _dum: null, and empty args/kwargs.
