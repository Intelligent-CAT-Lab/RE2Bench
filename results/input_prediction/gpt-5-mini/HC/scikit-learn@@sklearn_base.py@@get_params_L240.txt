[THOUGHT]
1. get_params builds a dict by iterating over the names returned by self._get_param_names() and setting out[key] = getattr(self, key) (and, if deep is True and the attribute has get_params, it would add nested params with key__subkey).
2. The output shows exactly these top-level keys and their values: affinity, convergence_iter, copy, damping, max_iter, preference, random_state, verbose.
3. That means each corresponding attribute on self must have those values. There are no nested parameters added, so either deep=True and none of the attribute values have a get_params method, or deep=False. Using the usual default, deep=True is appropriate.
4. Therefore fill the structure with the attribute values equal to the output, and set args.deep to true.
