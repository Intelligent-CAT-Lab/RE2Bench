[THOUGHT]
I need to find an input to ColumnTransformer.transform that would produce the output array [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]].

1. The transform method concatenates the outputs of the fitted transformers (Xs) horizontally (_hstack) and returns a numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_output_features). The final array has shape (3,2): 3 samples, 2 output columns.

2. The simplest scenario is a single fitted transformer ("trans") that when applied to the input X (3 samples) returns a 3x2 array [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]]. That means X can be a (3,1) column vector [[0],[1],[2]] and the transformer maps x -> [x, 2*x].

3. For transform to run without raising routing or fitted errors:
   - check_is_fitted must succeed. Setting n_features_in_ on self to match X.shape[1] (1) makes _check_n_features pass.
   - Routing is disabled by default, so transform will call self._get_empty_routing(), which internally calls self._iter(fitted=False,...). To avoid needing a remainder transformer in that phase, set self._remainder[2] to False so remainder is not added to the iteration.
   - Provide self.transformers as the pre-fit list of 3-tuples and self._columns as the list of column selections used during fit. For simplicity include one transformer entry ("trans", ..., ...) and _columns = [[0]].
   - Provide self.transformers_ (the fitted transformers) as a list with one entry ("trans", TRANSFORMER_PLACEHOLDER, [0]). The actual callable is not represented here; it's enough to show that the fitted transformer named "trans" will be applied to column 0 and is expected to return a (3,2) array.

4. Set sparse_output_ = False so the code path uses numpy.hstack and returns a numpy array.

5. Provide _transformer_to_input_indices mapping and output_indices_ so they are consistent: the input index for "trans" is [0]; output indices for "trans" are [0,1]. Remainder entries can be empty lists.

6. The X argument should be [[0], [1], [2]] (3 samples, 1 feature) so that the transformer can produce the desired [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]].

The structure below encodes these choices (using simple placeholders for transformer objects where appropriate).
