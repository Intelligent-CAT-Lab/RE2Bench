1. The returned object is a SubplotSpec created by GridSpecBase.__getitem__. The printed representation is "GridSpec(1, 1)[0:1, 0:1]".
2. That indicates the GridSpec has shape (1, 1) → _nrows = 1 and _ncols = 1.
3. The bracketed part "[0:1, 0:1]" corresponds to taking a slice 0:1 on the row axis and a slice 0:1 on the column axis. In __getitem__, a tuple key (k1, k2) is handled: each k is passed to _normalize. For slice(0,1) with size 1, _normalize returns (0, 0) (since stop-1 = 0).
4. np.ravel_multi_index is then called with the two pairs (0,0) and (0,0) and shape (1,1), resulting in two scalar indices (0, 0). So SubplotSpec(self, 0, 0) is returned, whose repr shows the original slice ranges as "0:1" for each axis.
5. Therefore the input key must be a tuple of the two slices slice(0, 1) for rows and columns. Other GridSpec fields (left, bottom, right, top, wspace, hspace, figure, _row_height_ratios, _col_width_ratios) can be set to reasonable values consistent with _nrows/_ncols = 1.

So the filled input sets _nrows and _ncols to 1 and provides key as the pair of slices (0:1, 0:1).
