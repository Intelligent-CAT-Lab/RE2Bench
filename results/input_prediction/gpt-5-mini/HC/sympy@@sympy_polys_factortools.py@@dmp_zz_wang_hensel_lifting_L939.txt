We need to find inputs that make dmp_zz_wang_hensel_lifting return the given H value:

Output H is:
[
  [[1], [1, 0]],
  [[1], [-1, 0]]
]

Simplest way is to avoid the main lifting loops so H is returned unchanged. The function's big loop iterates over A; if A is empty, that loop is skipped. Then the function only checks that dmp_expand(H, u, K) == f and returns H. So choose A = [].

We must pick u >= 1 so that dmp_degree_list(f, u)[1:] is non-empty (the code computes d = max(dmp_degree_list(f, u)[1:])). Pick u = 2 which is the smallest natural choice consistent with the nested representation of H (each coefficient is itself a 1-level dmp, e.g., [1] or [1,0]).

Interpret H for u = 2:
- H[0] = [[1], [1,0]] represents polynomial (in x) 1 + x (with inner lists being polynomials in the second variable; here they are constants or constants + 0*y).
- H[1] = [[1], [-1,0]] represents 1 - x.

Their product is (1 + x) * (1 - x) = 1 - x^2.

Represent 1 - x^2 in the same u = 2 nested format: coefficients for x^0, x^1, x^2 are ground polynomials (no dependence on the second variable), so each is a one-element list with the integer constant:
f = [ [1], [0], [-1] ]

LC and p are unused when A = [], so we can set LC = [] and p to any integer (e.g., 2). K can be a placeholder since we are not executing; use an empty object.

Thus the input values are:
- f = [[1], [0], [-1]]
- H = the provided output structure
- LC = []
- A = []
- p = 2
- u = 2
- K = {}

self is empty and kwargs is empty.
