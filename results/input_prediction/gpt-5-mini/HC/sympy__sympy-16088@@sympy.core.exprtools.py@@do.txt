[THOUGHT]
We need an input expr such that do(...) produces the string "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2".

Observations:
- 0.0644444444444444 = 29/450 (29/450 ≈ 0.06444444444444444...), so the underlying rational angle could be 29*pi/450.
- The output shows a floating-point coefficient (0.0644444444444444) rather than an exact Rational (29/450). sympy.sympify preserves floats as Float objects, so if the input uses a float coefficient (0.0644444444444444) the final printed form will match the output.
- do() handles Pow and Function nodes by recursively processing args; using the float in the inner argument will propagate through and the returned expression string will match the provided output.

Therefore the simplest input that yields the given output is the expression written with that float: "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2".

I'll supply that as the expr argument.
