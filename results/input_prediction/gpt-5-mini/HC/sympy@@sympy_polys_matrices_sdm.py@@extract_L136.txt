We need extract to return an SDM whose dict representation is:
{
  "0": {"0": 1},
  "1": {"0": 1},
  "2": {"0": 1}
}

Looking at extract:
- The result shape is (len(rows), len(cols)), so to get three output rows and one output column we need rows length = 3 and cols length = 1.
- The output has entries at result row indices 0,1,2 and result column index 0 with value 1. That arises when:
  - The input rows list maps to original row indices i1 = 0,1,2 (so rowmap maps original rows 0,1,2 to result indices 0,1,2).
  - The input cols list maps to original column j1 = 0 (so colmap maps original col 0 to result col index 0).
- For these intersections to produce values 1, the original SDM (self) must have non-zero entries at rows 0,1,2 and column 0 with value 1, i.e. the internal elemsdict = {0:{0:1}, 1:{0:1}, 2:{0:1}} and shape (3,1).
- extract will build sdm2 identical to that mapping when called with rows=[0,1,2], cols=[0].

Therefore the input should have:
- self.shape = (3, 1), self.rows = 3, self.cols = 1, domain can be any domain (not used in the printed output).
- args.rows = [0, 1, 2], args.cols = [0]
- kwargs = {}

I fill the placeholders accordingly.
