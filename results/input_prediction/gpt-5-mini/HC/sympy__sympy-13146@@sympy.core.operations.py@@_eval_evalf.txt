[THOUGHT]
1. The result "0.2*x" is a Mul of a Float(0.2) and Symbol x.
2. That is what happens when a rational coefficient 1/5 is evaluated to a floating-point number: 1/5 -> 0.2.
3. AssocOp._eval_evalf is used by Mul._eval_evalf to evaluate numeric parts to floating precision. The argument it receives is the precision "prec".
4. Any typical evaluation precision (e.g. 15 decimal digits, SymPy default) will convert Rational(1,5) to Float(0.2), producing "0.2*x".
5. Therefore a standard precision value of 15 is the expected prec input that yields the shown output.
