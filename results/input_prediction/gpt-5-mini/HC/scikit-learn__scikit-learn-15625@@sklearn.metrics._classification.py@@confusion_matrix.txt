[THOUGHT]
The output is a 2x2 confusion matrix with zeros off-diagonal and diagonal entries 9 and 11. This indicates two labels and perfect predictions (y_pred equals y_true), with total weight/counts 9 for the first label and 11 for the second.

unique_labels will determine the label ordering (for numeric labels it will be [0, 1]), and if sample_weight is None the function uses an array of ones so the counts are simply the number of occurrences of each label.

Therefore choose y_true to contain nine 0's and eleven 1's, y_pred identical to y_true, and sample_weight set to null (None) so the counts are the raw occurrence counts producing the matrix [[9, 0], [0, 11]].
