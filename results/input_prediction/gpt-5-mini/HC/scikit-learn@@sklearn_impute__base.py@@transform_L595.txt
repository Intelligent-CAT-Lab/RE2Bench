We need to infer the inputs to SimpleImputer.transform that produced the given imputed output.

1. Inspect the output array column-wise to find values that look like repeated imputation constants (the per-feature statistics). The repeated unusual floats are:
   - column 0: 5.80707965 (appears multiple times)
   - column 1: 3.07211538 (appears multiple times)
   - column 2: 3.75545455 (appears multiple times)
   - column 3: 1.19722222 (appears multiple times)

   Therefore statistics_ is very likely [5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222].

2. transform fills missing entries (mask based on self.missing_values) with the corresponding entry from statistics_. So any output cell equal to the statistic for its column was likely an imputed value that in the input X was missing (np.nan).

3. Construct the input X by taking the output and replacing any cell that equals its column statistic with null (to represent np.nan in the JSON-style structure). All other cells remain the same.

4. Set SimpleImputer attributes consistent with this operation:
   - missing_values: np.nan (represented as null in the JSON-like structure)
   - add_indicator: false (no extra indicator columns are present in the output)
   - keep_empty_features: false
   - strategy: "mean"
   - fill_value: null
   - copy: true
   - n_features_in_: 4
   - _fit_dtype and _fill_dtype: "float64" (dtype seen during fit / fill)
   - indicator_: null (not used because add_indicator is false)
   - statistics_: [5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222)

5. The input X is the same shape as the output (30 rows × 4 columns) with nulls where the output equals the per-column statistic.

Below is the reconstructed input structure.
