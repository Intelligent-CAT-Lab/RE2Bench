[THOUGHT]
We need parse_email to return raw={"download_url": "VaLuE"} and unparsed={}.

- The packaging metadata mapping maps the header name "download-url" (case-insensitive) to the raw field name "download_url".
- If the input is a str, the parser uses email.parser.Parser with compat32. Supplying a simple ASCII header "Download-URL: VaLuE" will produce headers list ["VaLuE"] for the name "download-url".
- download_url is a string field in the mapping, and since there's exactly one value, raw["download_url"] will be set to "VaLuE".
- To keep unparsed empty, avoid any headers that are unmapped or with invalid encoding, and ensure the message body (payload) is empty (or empty string), so no "description" is added.
- Therefore, an appropriate input is the string with that single header and a blank line separating headers and body: "Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n".

I'll provide the function input with data set to that string.
