[THOUGHT]
1. The output keys are 4-tuples (e.g. "(2, 0, 0, 0)"), so m must be 4 (the tuples have length m).
2. Each tuple sums to 2 (2+0+0+0 = 2, 1+1+0+0 = 2, etc.), so n must be 2.
3. With m=4 and n=2, the number of weak compositions is C(2+4-1,4-1)=C(5,3)=10, matching the 10 entries in the output.
4. In the code, for m >= 2*n and n > 1 (here 4 >= 4 and 2 > 1), multinomial_coefficients returns dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(m, n)), which enumerates all 4-part tuples summing to 2 and yields the multinomial coefficients 2!/(t0! t1! t2! t3!), producing the given values (1 or 2) exactly.

Therefore the input is m = 4, n = 2.
