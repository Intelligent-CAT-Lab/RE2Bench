[THOUGHT]
We need to produce inputs such that calling _MultimetricScorer.__call__ returns {"score": -Infinity}.

1. The method builds routed_params from kwargs. The provided structure shows kwargs is {} so routed_params will be a Bunch with routed_params.score.score == {} (i.e., an empty dict of extra kwargs for the "score" scorer).
2. For each scorer in self._scorers it does:
   - if isinstance(scorer, _BaseScorer): call scorer._score(...)
   - else: call scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)
   To get a numeric -Infinity result without exceptions, simplest is to make the "score" entry a callable that returns -float('inf') regardless of its inputs.
3. No exception should be raised, so _raise_exc can be True (or False), but True is fine.
4. estimator and extra positional args are irrelevant for a scorer that ignores inputs; use simple placeholders (an empty object and empty list).

So set:
- self._scorers["score"] to a callable-like placeholder that returns -Infinity (represented in JSON as a descriptive object).
- _raise_exc: true
- estimator: an empty object placeholder
- args: empty list

This matches the code path that yields scores["score"] = -Infinity and returns {"score": -Infinity}.
