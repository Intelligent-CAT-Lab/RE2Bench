[THOUGHT]
1. The function first checks if key is a tuple. If it is, it attempts to return self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j)). So the simplest way to get "cos(phi)" as the final output is to take the tuple-key branch and have self._rep.getitem_sympy(...) produce cos(phi).
2. To keep indices valid, choose a small matrix shape such as rows = 1, cols = 1 and use key = (0, 0).
3. Represent the _rep object so that its getitem_sympy method returns the desired value "cos(phi)". In JSON I represent that by providing an object with a getitem_sympy entry whose value is the string "cos(phi)".
4. kwargs is empty.

This leads to the following input: the matrix has shape 1x1, key is the tuple (0, 0), and _rep.getitem_sympy returns "cos(phi)".
