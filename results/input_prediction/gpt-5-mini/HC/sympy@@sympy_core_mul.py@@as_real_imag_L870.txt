[THOUGHT]
1. We need an expression whose as_real_imag() returns (2*pi, 0).
2. For a Mul expression combining two real factors 2 and pi, Mul.as_real_imag will collect real parts into coeffr, get reco = Mul(*coeffr) = 2*pi, and since there are no imaginary parts it will return (reco, 0).
3. Therefore using self equal to the product 2*pi and calling as_real_imag with deep=True yields ("2*pi", "0").
4. So set "self" to the expression "2*pi" and "deep" to true.
