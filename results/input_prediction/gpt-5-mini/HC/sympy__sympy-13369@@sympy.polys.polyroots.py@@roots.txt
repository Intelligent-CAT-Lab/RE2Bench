[THOUGHT]
We need an input to roots(...) that yields the output {"0": 1} (a mapping from the root 0 to multiplicity 1).

The simplest case is the polynomial x: roots(x) should return {0: 1}.
- The function will call Poly(f, *gens, **flags). If f is the symbol x (SymPy Symbol), Poly(x) produces a degree-1 polynomial in x.
- terms_gcd on that Poly will produce k = 1, so zeros is initialized to {S(0): 1}.
- For a linear polynomial, the code path sets the single root 0 with multiplicity 1, and after merging with zeros the final result is {0: 1}.

Therefore the input is a single positional argument f equal to the symbol "x" (i.e., SymPy's x).
