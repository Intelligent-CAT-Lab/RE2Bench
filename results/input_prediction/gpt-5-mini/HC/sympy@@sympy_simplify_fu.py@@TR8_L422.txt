[THOUGHT]
We need an input expression that TR8 will transform to cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2.

- The identity cos^2(phi) = (cos(2*phi) + 1) / 2 matches the output.
- TR8 specifically handles Pow nodes whose base is cos or sin with integer exponents. For rv = cos(phi)**2, the function will:
  - At the top-level call (first=True) split numerator/denominator and recurse with first=False.
  - In the second-stage (first=False) treat the Pow with integer exponent > 0 as two cos(phi) factors, then combine them using the cos*cos product-to-sum identity to produce (cos(2*phi)+1)/2.
- Therefore the input rv should be cos(phi)**2 and first should be true.

So the predicted input is rv = "cos(phi)**2", first = true.
