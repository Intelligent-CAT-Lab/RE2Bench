[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that produce an array of five timestamps:
['1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000']

decode_cf_datetime does:
- if calendar is None, sets calendar = 'standard' and tries _decode_datetime_with_pandas
- _decode_datetime_with_pandas unpacks units with regex "(.+) since (.+)" into (delta_units, ref_date)
- delta_units is mapped to numpy time unit (e.g., 'hours' -> 'h'), and pd.Timestamp(ref_date) constructs the reference time
- flat_num_dates * ns_per_unit -> timedelta added to ref_date

To get the five times spaced by 1 hour starting at 1681-05-27T12:00:00.5, a natural choice is:
- num_dates = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- units = "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.5"
- calendar left as None (so default 'standard' is used)

Those inputs produce pd.Timestamp('1681-05-27 12:00:00.500000000') plus 0..4 hours, yielding the given output array.
