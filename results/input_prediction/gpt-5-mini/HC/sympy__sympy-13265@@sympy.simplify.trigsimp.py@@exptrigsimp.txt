[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows a single attribute "nargs" whose internal "_elements" is "frozenset({1})". In SymPy, a function class like sin has nargs equal to FiniteSet(1), whose internal storage is _elements = frozenset({1}).
2. exptrigsimp returns a SymPy expression (possibly unchanged). If the returned value is the sine function class itself, its representation would include nargs = FiniteSet(1) (i.e. _elements frozenset({1})).
3. The simplest input that would produce that output is the sin function object itself (not sin(x)). Passing sin through the bottom_up/rewrite machinery leaves the function class, so the resulting object's nargs matches the observed output.
4. Therefore set expr to the sin function.
