[THOUGHT]
We need an input expr that nsimplify will convert to the complex expression 1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2.

Key points from the function:
- It first tries sympify(as_int(expr)), which will fail for non-integer expressions.
- Then it does expr = sympify(expr) and evaluates exprval = expr.evalf(prec,...), then separates real and imaginary parts and runs mpmath.identify to find a closed-form expression.
- A natural source of 1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2 is exp(-I*pi/3) because exp(-i*pi/3) = cos(pi/3) - i sin(pi/3) = 1/2 - i*(sqrt(3)/2).

So a simple plausible input is the string "exp(-I*pi/3)". sympify will parse that into the corresponding SymPy expression; nsimplify should identify it as 1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2.

I'll therefore set expr's nargs._elements to contain the single expression "exp(-I*pi/3)". Other parts remain empty as in the structure.
