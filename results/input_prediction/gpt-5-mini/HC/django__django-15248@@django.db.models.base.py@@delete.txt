[THOUGHT]
1. Model.delete first checks self.pk is not None. pk is derived from the primary key attribute (commonly "id"). So id must be non-null (e.g., 1) to avoid the ValueError.
2. router.db_for_write will prefer instance._state.db if present. That is not required to produce the deletion counts, but it's safe to give a DB alias like "default".
3. The returned value is the tuple/list [1, {"signals.Person": 1}], meaning one object of model signals.Person was deleted. That matches deleting a Person instance with a real primary key.
4. Other attributes (first_name, last_name) can be any strings and _state.adding should be False to indicate this is an existing (not new) instance.
5. Therefore set _state.db to "default", _state.adding to false, id to 1, and give example names for first_name/last_name.
