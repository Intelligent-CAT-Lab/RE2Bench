[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that make collect(...) return a sympy Dummy object whose printed name is "_Dummy_373".

Simplest path: if expr is a symbol (or Dummy) X and syms is the same symbol X, with evaluate=True, collect will match the symbol pattern and return X unchanged. So to get the printed name "_Dummy_373" we use a sympy Dummy with that name as both expr and syms.

We therefore set:
- expr = "_Dummy_373" (representing the Dummy symbol _Dummy_373),
- syms = "_Dummy_373" (the same symbol),
- func = null,
- evaluate = true,
- exact = false,
- distribute_order_term = true.

With these inputs, collect will parse the single-term expression, match the single symbol pattern, produce collected = { _Dummy_373: 1 }, and return Add(_Dummy_373*1) which is just the Dummy _Dummy_373, matching the given output.
