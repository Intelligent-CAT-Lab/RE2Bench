[THOUGHT]
1. The add_hash method appends a generated script to self._script_snippets and returns self.
2. The observed output is "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>", which is the printed/repr form of the returned self. That means the call returned the same _ClassBuilder instance (with its _cls named "A"), but add_hash itself doesn't change the "identity" string format.
3. None of the three provided input fields (auto_attribs, these, has_custom_setattr) affect the fact that add_hash returns self, so reasonable default values suffice. The important point is that add_hash returns the builder instance, so the output matches the instance repr.
4. Provide simple, typical constructor parameter values: auto_attribs = false, these = [] (no attributes), has_custom_setattr = false. args and kwargs are empty.
