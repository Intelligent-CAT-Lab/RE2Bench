[THOUGHT]
1. The function switch_backend returns None on normal completion. The provided output shows {"output": null}, so the function completed without raising an exception.
2. Many backend names would allow successful completion (e.g., 'agg', 'tkagg', 'qt5agg', etc.). To choose a robust, minimal, non-interactive backend that is typically always available and does not require a GUI framework, 'agg' is the safest choice.
3. 'agg' will let load_backend_module import the backend module, set rcParams['backend'], update globals and try install_repl_displayhook. In typical environments install_repl_displayhook either no-ops or sets up hooks; it usually does not raise NotImplementedError, so the function returns None.
4. Therefore the input newbackend that matches the observed successful (null) output is "agg".
