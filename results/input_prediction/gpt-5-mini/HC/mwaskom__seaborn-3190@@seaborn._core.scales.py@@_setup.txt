[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that, when _setup runs, produce the shown attributes on the returned "new" Scale object.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The function begins with new = copy(self). If new._tick_params is None, it would call new = new.tick() to populate tick params; but the output shows _tick_params as a dict of keys all null (not None). So the input self must already have _tick_params set to that dict (so no call to tick()).
2. Similarly, the output shows _label_params as a dict with keys all null, so the input self must have _label_params already set to that dict (so no call to label()).
3. The output shows trans is "log", and values and norm are null. So set self.trans = "log", self.values = null, self.norm = null.
4. The code calls new._get_transform() and new._get_scale(str(data.name), forward, inverse). The output contains a _matplotlib_scale with an inner _transform structure; we don't need to model the exact transform functions — it's enough that a scale object is created. The creation path uses str(data.name), so data must have a name; put data._name = "values".
5. The output shows _pipeline is null. In the function, new._pipeline is set to [axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new,data)]. For _pipeline to be effectively null in the reported output, assume prop.get_mapping returns null and prop.normed is false so normalize is None; set prop.variable to contain normed: false, get_mapping: null, and legend: false (so _legend remains null).
6. The output shows _spacer as {} (a callable in runtime, but represented here as an object). We don't need to model that; having inputs above will cause _spacer to be set to that function.
7. Put simple, consistent placeholders for data internals: _is_copy null, _mgr.axes and _mgr.blocks null, empty caches/attrs, flags with _allows_duplicate_labels false.

Given the structure we were asked to keep, fill in the XXXs accordingly to match the final shown attributes.
