[THOUGHT]
We need an input that makes Expr.__int__ produce no return value (JSON null). In this harness, null indicates the method raised an exception rather than returning an int.

Looking at __int__:
1. It first checks if not self.is_number: if so, it raises TypeError("Cannot convert symbols to int").
2. Only if is_number is True does it continue; subsequent checks can also raise TypeError for non-comparable, complex, infinities, or inability to compute accurately.

The simplest way to cause the function to raise immediately (and thus result in null) is to pass a non-numeric expression so that self.is_number is False. A representative non-numeric SymPy expression is a symbol, e.g. Symbol('x'). So set self to "Symbol('x')" (string representation of such an expression). args and kwargs are empty.

Therefore the input is self = "Symbol('x')", args = {}, kwargs = {}.

    "self": "Symbol('x')",
