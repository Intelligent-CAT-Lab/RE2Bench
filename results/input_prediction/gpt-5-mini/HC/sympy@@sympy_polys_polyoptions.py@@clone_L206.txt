[THOUGHT]
The clone method does:
- create a new dict-like object,
- copy every (option, value) from self into it,
- then for every (option, value) in updates, set obj[option] = value (overwriting or adding).

The observed output contains "gens": ["cos(phi)"], so that must come from the updates argument (or already in self, but since clone overwrites with updates, providing updates.gens = ["cos(phi)"] is sufficient to ensure the result has that value). The output also contains "fraction": true which would have been present in self; we are not asked to fill self (only placeholders), so we only need to supply updates.gens.

Thus set updates.gens to the list ["cos(phi)"].
