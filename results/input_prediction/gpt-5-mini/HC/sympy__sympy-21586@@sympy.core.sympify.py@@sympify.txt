[THOUGHT]
We need an input that causes sympify(a, strict=...) to produce the SymPy expression that, when converted to string, is "2500/pi".

Simplest and most direct path in the function is the string parsing branch:
- If a is not marked strict and is a string, the function falls through to the parse_expr call at the end.
- parse_expr("2500/pi", ...) will produce the SymPy expression 2500/pi.

The function's signature sets strict=False by default, so use strict: false.

Therefore choose a = "2500/pi" and strict = false.
