[THOUGHT]
We need inputs such that vpack executes without raising and returns None (null). vpack returns early iff x == 0 after computing x = h - x. Starting values: w,d,x initialized to 0.0; with an empty children list the loop is skipped, so x remains 0.0 and d stays 0.0; then if m == 'additional', h += x leaves h unchanged. self.height is set to h and then x = h - x gives x == h. To get x == 0 and take the early return, set h = 0.0.

To avoid any type/comparison errors, use an empty children list so no Node-type checks run. Set l to a large finite number (e.g. 1e308) so d > l is false (d == 0.0). Other self attributes can be neutral defaults: numeric zeros and glue_set null.

Thus choose:
- self.children = []
- self.size = 0, width/height/depth = 0.0, shift_amount = 0.0
- glue_set = null, glue_sign = 0, glue_order = 0
- args: h = 0.0, m = "additional", l = 1e308

With these values vpack will set width = 0.0, height = 0.0, see x == 0 and set glue_sign/glue_order/glue_ratio to zeros and return None (null).
