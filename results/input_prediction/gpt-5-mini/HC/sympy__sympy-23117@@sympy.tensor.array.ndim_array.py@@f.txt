[THOUGHT]
We need the input "pointer" such that the inner function f (from _scan_iterable_shape) produces the JSON output [null, []].

Looking at f(pointer):

- If pointer is not an Iterable, f returns ([pointer], ()) — a 2-tuple whose first element is a list containing pointer, second is an empty tuple.
- If pointer is None (which is not an Iterable), f(None) returns ([None], ()).

When serialized to JSON, Python None becomes null and an empty tuple becomes an empty list. So ([None], ()) corresponds to the JSON representation [null, []].

Therefore pointer must be None.

{
    "self": {},

        "pointer": null
