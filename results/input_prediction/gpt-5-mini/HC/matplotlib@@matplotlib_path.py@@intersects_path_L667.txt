intersects_path(self, other, filled) simply returns _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled). To make the result True, choose self and other Path-like objects whose vertex sets overlap. Use simple, intersecting shapes: self a unit square [(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)] and other a triangle that overlaps the square, e.g. [(0.5,0.5),(1.5,0.5),(0.5,1.5)]. Set codes to null (None) for both, interpolation steps to 1, simplify_threshold to a small float and should_simplify False, readonly False. Use filled=True (the default) so the filled area intersection is true. These inputs will make _path.path_intersects_path return True.
