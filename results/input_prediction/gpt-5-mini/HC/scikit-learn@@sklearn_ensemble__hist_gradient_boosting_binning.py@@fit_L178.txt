[THOUGHT]
1. The output string "_BinMapper(n_bins=11, random_state=42)" identifies the estimator's important attributes after construction / fitting: n_bins is 11 and random_state is 42. So in the input self.n_bins must be 11 and self.random_state must be 42.

2. Other constructor defaults from the provided class:
   - subsample = int(200000.0) → 200000
   - is_categorical = None
   - known_categories = None
   - n_threads = None

   I'll use these defaults for the missing self fields.

3. Execution of fit does input validation via check_array(..., ensure_all_finite=False). X must be a 2D array with at least one feature and at least one sample. The code also later iterates over features and expects to compute binning thresholds for non-categorical features. With is_categorical None the code sets is_categorical_ to zeros for each feature, so numeric features are fine.

4. To satisfy all checks, provide a small numeric 2D array X, e.g. [[0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0]] (shape (2,2)). This yields n_features=2, triggers computation of thresholds for both features and does not violate any checks. y can be None.

5. kwargs is empty.

Thus the input fields are filled accordingly.
