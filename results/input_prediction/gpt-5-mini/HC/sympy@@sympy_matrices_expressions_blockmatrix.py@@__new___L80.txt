1. The output is the string representation of a BlockMatrix converted to a (Immutable) Dense Matrix of blocks:
   Matrix([
     [Matrix([[4,2],[2,3],[7,5]]), Matrix([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])],
     [Matrix([[1,0],[0,1]]),    Matrix([[1,2,3],[3,5,4]])]
   ])
2. In BlockMatrix.__new__, after validation it constructs mat = ImmutableDenseMatrix(rows, evaluate=False) where rows is a 2×2 nested sequence whose entries are Matrix objects with the listed numeric entries.
3. Basic.__new__ is then called with cls (the BlockMatrix class) and a single positional argument mat. So the input to Basic.__new__ is:
   - cls = BlockMatrix
   - args = (mat,) where mat can be represented by the nested 2×2 list-of-matrices structure.
4. I will represent the mat as a nested list structure of the numeric matrices (each inner matrix given by its list-of-rows). That matches the printed output content.
