[THOUGHT]
We need the input for restify that produces the string ":py:obj:`None`".

Looking at the function:
- The first condition is "if cls is None or cls is NoneType: return ':py:obj:`None`'".
- So if cls is either the Python value None or the NoneType (type(None)), the function returns the given output.

In JSON input representation, the Python None is encoded as null. Representing the actual NoneType object is not practical in JSON. Therefore the simplest correct input is to set "cls" to null (Python None), which will trigger the first branch and return ":py:obj:`None`".

    "self": {},
