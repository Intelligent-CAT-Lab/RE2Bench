[THOUGHT]
We need to find the state and arguments that would produce the given Authorization header string from build_digest_header.

1. The output header shows username="user" and uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", so username must be "user" and the URL path must be "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass". The password seen in the URI is "pass", so password should be "pass".

2. The header includes realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899", opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904", algorithm="MD5", and qop="auth". These values come from self.chal, so chal must contain:
   - realm: "me@kennethreitz.com"
   - nonce: "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
   - opaque: "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"
   - algorithm: "MD5"
   - qop: "auth"
   - stale: (not used in output — set to None)

3. The header shows nc=00000001, so nonce_count must be set to 1 by build_digest_header. The code sets nonce_count to 1 when the current nonce differs from self.last_nonce. Therefore set last_nonce to a different value (empty string) so nonce_count becomes 1 in the method. The starting nonce_count value in the object can be anything (e.g., 0), but the method will set it to 1.

4. The header contains cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"; cnonce is generated inside the function from nonce_count, nonce, current time and os.urandom. We don't need to reproduce those internals here — we only need to supply the object state that was used to produce the observed header. So we provide the chal and other fields as above and leave pos None and num_401_calls at its default (1).

5. The method used to build the A2 hash is included implicitly via HA2. Typical use is method "GET". Any method consistent with the observed header (which does not display method) is acceptable; "GET" is the conventional choice.

6. For URL supply a full URL whose path is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", e.g. "http://example.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

Putting that together yields the input structure below.
