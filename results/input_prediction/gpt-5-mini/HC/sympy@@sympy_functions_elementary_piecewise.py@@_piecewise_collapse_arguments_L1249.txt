[THOUGHT]
We need _piecewise_collapse_arguments to return two ExprCondPair entries printed as "(1, x < 0)" and "(3, True)".

Step through the function:

- On the first input pair, to get "(1, x < 0)" we can simply have the first tuple be (1, x < 0). It will be added to newargs and x < 0 will be added to current_cond.

- For the second input pair to collapse to condition True, the code has a branch:
    elif isinstance(cond, Relational):
        if cond.negated.canonical in current_cond:
            cond = S.true

  So if the second condition is the negation of the first (in canonical form), the second cond becomes True. The negation of "x < 0" is "x >= 0" (Ge). For cond = x >= 0, cond.negated is x < 0, so cond.negated.canonical is x < 0 which is already in current_cond. Thus the second pair (3, x >= 0) will be turned into (3, True).

Therefore the simplest input that yields the shown output is:
_args = [(1, x < 0), (3, x >= 0)]
(The self and kwargs are empty as required by the structure.)
