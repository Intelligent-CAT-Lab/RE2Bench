[THOUGHT]
1. The function looks for '(' characters to identify unnamed groups. The returned output "^a/?$" contains no '('.
2. With no unnamed groups found, group_start_end_indices will be empty, so the function returns the original pattern unchanged.
3. Therefore the input pattern must have been "^a/?$".
