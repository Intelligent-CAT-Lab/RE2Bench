[THOUGHT]
1. The as_terms implementation iterates over Add.make_args(self) and processes each term.
2. The output shows four terms in order: "y**2", "z**2", "-w**2", "-x**2". So Add.make_args(self) must have produced those terms.
3. The gens list is ["w", "x", "y", "z"] and the monomial vectors correspond to exponents in that order:
   - y**2 -> [0,0,2,0] (exponent 2 at index of y)
   - z**2 -> [0,0,0,2]
   - -w**2 -> [2,0,0,0]
   - -x**2 -> [0,2,0,0]
4. Therefore the expression is y**2 + z**2 - w**2 - x**2 (an Add of those four terms). Using that as self will produce the shown output.
