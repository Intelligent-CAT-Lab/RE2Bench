[THOUGHT]
We need args_cnc to return a list whose first element is a set containing the element 2 (serialized as "{'2'}") and whose second element is null. The function behavior:

- If self.is_Mul is false, args becomes [self].
- The loop searches for the first non-commutative argument; with a single commutative numeric self (Integer(2)) there is none, so c = [self] and nc = [].
- The split_1 special-case doesn't apply for positive Integer(2).
- If cset is True, c is converted to a set: set([Integer(2)]) -> {Integer(2)}, which will be serialized as "{'2'}" (the output's first element).
- nc is the empty list; in the provided serialization it appears as null.

Therefore we must call args_cnc with cset = true. The structure requires only filling the XXX for cset.

So the input kwargs should set "cset": true.
