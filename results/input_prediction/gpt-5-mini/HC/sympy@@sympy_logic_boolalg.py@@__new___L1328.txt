[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to Equivalent.__new__ that produce the printed object Equivalent(Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)).

1. __new__ receives cls and a variable list of arguments. The output shows two arguments: Q.even(X*Z) and (Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)). So the *args passed to __new__ should be those two expressions.
2. evaluate can be left True (or None to use global_parameters.evaluate). Using evaluate=True will allow normal construction and return the Equivalent object with the given args.
3. Nothing in the Equivalent.__new__ code performs further simplification for these predicate expressions, so passing these two expressions as-is results in the shown output.

Therefore set:
- cls to "Equivalent"
- evaluate to true
- args to the list ["Q.even(X*Z)", "Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)"]

Keep self and kwargs empty as required by the structure.

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "cls": "Equivalent",
        "evaluate": true,
        "args": [
            "Q.even(X*Z)",
            "Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)"
        ]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
