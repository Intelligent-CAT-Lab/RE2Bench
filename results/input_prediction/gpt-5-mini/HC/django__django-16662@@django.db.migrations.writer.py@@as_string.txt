[THOUGHT]
1. as_string builds the migration file text from the MigrationWriter.migration attributes.
2. To get only "from django.db import migrations" at the top and empty dependencies/operations blocks, there must be:
   - No operations (migration.operations == []) so items['operations'] becomes ''.
   - No dependencies (migration.dependencies is empty). The structure doesn't require setting dependencies explicitly; using a minimal migration object with empty operations is consistent.
3. include_header must be False; otherwise a timestamp/header line would appear.
4. needs_manual_porting can be False; it's only mutated if imports contain migration import entries.
5. The code always ensures an import line is added when imports is empty: it adds 'from django.db import migrations'. That matches the output's first line.
6. migration.__module__ and __doc__ can be the minimal values (module string and None).
7. Therefore the simplest input consistent with the output:
   - migration.operations = []
   - migration.__module__ = "django.db.migrations"
   - migration.__doc__ = null
   - include_header = False
   - needs_manual_porting = False
8. args and kwargs are empty.
