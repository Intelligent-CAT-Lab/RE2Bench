[THOUGHT]
get_masked_triangles returns self.triangles[~self.mask] if mask is not None, otherwise it returns self.triangles.

The provided output is the full triangles array (32 triangles, indices up to 24). The simplest consistent internal state is:
- mask is None so get_masked_triangles returns triangles unchanged.
- triangles must equal the listed array.
- x and y must be arrays with length > max(triangles) (max index is 24), so at least length 25. I'll use 0..24 for x and y.
- other internal attributes can be None or reasonable defaults.

I'll set:
- x and y to lists of 25 numbers (0 through 24),
- mask to null,
- _edges, _neighbors, _cpp_triangulation, _trifinder to null,
- is_delaunay to false,
- triangles to the given list of 32 triplets.

This state will make get_masked_triangles return exactly the output shown.
