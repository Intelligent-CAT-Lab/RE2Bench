[THOUGHT]
We need the inputs to the inner function doit(p, q) so that its return value is 0 (printed as "0").

Looking at doit:
- The earliest direct return of zero is in:
    if p == S.Zero or p == q or p == -q or (p.is_integer and q == 1):
        return S.Zero
- So the simplest way to get a zero result is to make p equal to S.Zero (i.e., p == 0). q must not be zero (that would raise ZeroDivisionError earlier), so pick any nonzero q.

Therefore choose p = 0 and q = 5 (nonzero). This makes the branch p == S.Zero true and doit returns S.Zero, which corresponds to the output "0".
