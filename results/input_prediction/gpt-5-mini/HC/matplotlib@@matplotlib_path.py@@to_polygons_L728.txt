[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a single polygon with two points: [[80., 330.], [576., 330.]]. The to_polygons implementation returns [vertices] directly only when:
   - self.codes is None, and
   - (width == 0 or height == 0), and
   - transform is None (so no transform is applied).
2. If closed_only is True and len(vertices) < 3, to_polygons returns [] — but our output is not empty. Therefore closed_only must be False so that a 2-vertex polygon is allowed.
3. So the simplest input that produces the given output is:
   - self._vertices equals [[80., 330.], [576., 330.]]
   - self._codes is null (None)
   - width == 0 (or height == 0); choose both 0
   - transform is null (None)
   - closed_only is False
4. Other internal flags (_interpolation_steps, _simplify_threshold, _should_simplify, _readonly) do not affect this branch; set reasonable values.

Thus the filled input uses those values.
