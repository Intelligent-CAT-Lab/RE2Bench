[THOUGHT]
The register method returns the nested function "_" (the decorator) without calling it. So any call of the form dispatcher.register(...) will return "<function Dispatcher.register.<locals>>". To produce that output, "self" must be a Dispatcher instance (or a structure representing it), and "types" can be any tuple of types (or an empty tuple). I'll supply a plausible Dispatcher state and a typical types tuple (("int", "str")) as the arguments. The kwargs are empty.
