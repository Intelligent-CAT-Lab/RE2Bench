We need to produce self such that _get_kernel_params returns {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}.

Looking at the code:
- params = self.kernel_params; if None -> params = {}
- The branch that fills params runs when kernel is not callable and kernel != 'precomputed'.
- It iterates over KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]; for each param, if getattr(self, param) is not None, it sets params[param] = getattr(self, param).
- The else (which would raise ValueError) only triggers when kernel is callable or 'precomputed' and any of gamma/coef0/degree is not None.

So to get only coef0 and degree in the result:
- Choose a string kernel whose KERNEL_PARAMS list contains 'gamma', 'coef0', 'degree' (e.g., "poly").
- Set self.gamma = None so 'gamma' is not added.
- Set self.coef0 = 0.1 and self.degree = 3.1 so those two get added.
- Set self.kernel_params = None so we start from an empty dict.
- Ensure kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed' (string "poly" satisfies that).

Other attributes can be null/defaults.

Thus the input self fields are set accordingly, with args and kwargs empty.
