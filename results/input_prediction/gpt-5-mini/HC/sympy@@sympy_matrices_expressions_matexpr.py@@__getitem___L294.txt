[THOUGHT]
We need a key that makes MatrixExpr.__getitem__ return an object whose string is "X[1, 2]".

Looking at __getitem__:
- If key is a tuple of length 2 and neither element is a slice, it does:
    i, j = key
    i, j = (_sympify(i), _sympify(j))
    if self.valid_index(i, j) != False:
        return self._entry(i, j)
    else: raise IndexError

For many MatrixExpr subclasses (and the generic matexpr._entry) the returned object is a MatrixElement(self, i, j), whose string form is "X[1, 2]" when self is named X and i=1, j=2.

Therefore the simplest input that produces the requested output is a 2-tuple of integers (1, 2). Represented in JSON as an array [1, 2].

So the input key should be the tuple (1, 2).
