We need to find inputs that could produce the given test_folds output from StratifiedKFold._make_test_folds.

1. The output values are fold indices 0..4, so n_splits must be 5.
2. The method shuffles per-class assignments only if self.shuffle is True. The provided output shows a deterministic-looking allocation pattern (fold indices clustered and repeated), so a reasonable assumption is shuffle=False. With shuffle=False the random_state does not affect results; set it to None.
3. The length of the output array (number of samples) is the length of y. Counting up the entries in the provided output yields 155 elements, so y must be length 155.
4. A simple, valid multiclass y that will produce a deterministic stratified allocation is a sorted array with 5 classes and equal counts. 155 divides into 5 classes of 31 each (31*5 = 155), which yields a valid multiclass y (type_of_target -> 'multiclass') and will let the method produce a deterministic test_folds array with n_splits=5 and shuffle=False.
5. X is unused in this method; provide a minimal array-like stub consistent with shape and ndim (shape (155, ), ndim 1) and an iloc array for compatibility.

Given these deductions, I supply:
- self.n_splits = 5
- self.shuffle = False
- self.random_state = None
- X: a 1-D array-like stub of length 155
- y: a 1-D array of length 155 with class labels [0]*31 + [1]*31 + [2]*31 + [3]*31 + [4]*31

This y is a valid multiclass target of length 155 and matches the structural requirements needed to produce the provided test_folds output under the assumptions above.
