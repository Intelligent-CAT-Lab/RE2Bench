[THOUGHT]
We need _eval_real_imag to return True.

Look at the code:
- zero starts as False, t_not_re_im is None.
- The for-loop iterates over self.args. If self.args is empty, the loop body is skipped.
- After the loop, since t_not_re_im is falsy and zero is False, the function returns real.

Therefore, the simplest way to get True is:
- set self.args to an empty tuple/list (so the loop is skipped),
- pass real = True.

So the input should have self with an empty args and real set to true.
