We need _route_params to return a Bunch/res that contains both keys "sample_weight" and "metadata" with the given values. Looking at the code:

- args = {k: v for k, v in params.items() if v is not None}
- For each prop, alias in self._requests:
  - If alias is False or alias == WARN: skipped (won't appear)
  - If alias is True and prop in args: res[prop] = args[prop] (direct inclusion)
  - If alias is None and prop in args: unrequested[prop] = args[prop] (would cause an exception later)
  - elif alias in args: res[prop] = args[alias] (alias treated as a parameter name)

To obtain res with both "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a" and avoid raising UnsetMetadataPassedError, both properties must be handled (not skipped and not left as unrequested). The simplest is to set both aliases to True so they are directly copied into res.

Thus set self._requests = {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True} and pass params = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}. parent and caller can be arbitrary (they are unused when no unrequested). owner and method can be arbitrary strings as well.

Here is the input filling the placeholders accordingly.
