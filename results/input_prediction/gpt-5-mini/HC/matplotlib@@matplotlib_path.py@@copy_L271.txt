[THOUGHT]
The copy method does a shallow copy (return copy.copy(self)), so the returned object will have the same _vertices and _codes as the original. The output string "Path([[0., 0.],1., 1.]], [1, 2])" is missing a bracket but clearly corresponds to vertices [[0., 0.], [1., 1.]] and codes [1, 2] (MOVETO=1, LINETO=2).

copy does not modify other attributes, so provide values consistent with a small Path of two vertices:
- _vertices: [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]
- _codes: [1, 2]
- _interpolation_steps: 1 (default-like)
- _simplify_threshold: 0.0 (could be any number; set 0.0 so _should_simplify is False)
- _should_simplify: False (with only 2 vertices it's False)
- _readonly: False

No args or kwargs.

These inputs produce a shallow-copied Path that would print as the shown output.
