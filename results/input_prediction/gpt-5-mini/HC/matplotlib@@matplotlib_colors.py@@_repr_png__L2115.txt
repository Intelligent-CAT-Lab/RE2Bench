[THOUGHT]
We need to reconstruct a plausible BivarColormap instance state that would produce the given PNG when calling _repr_png_.

Key observations from the PNG bytes:
- The embedded tEXt Title is "BiCone BivarColormap". _repr_png_ builds the Title as self.name + ' BivarColormap', so self.name must be "BiCone".
- The PNG IHDR shows width and height 256x256 (IHDR fields \x00\x00\x01\x00), so the produced image is 256×256. The class uses self.N (and in _init sets self._lut shape to (self.N, self.N, 4)), so N must be 256 (and M can be 256 as well).
- _repr_png_ calls self.lut, which will call self._init() if self._isinit is False. The provided structure does not include self._lut, so a realistic input sets _isinit to False and provides a small "patch" array so _init() can construct _lut from it. _init expects self.patch to be an array-like with shape s = (s0, s1, 3) (RGB). I'll provide a simple 2×2 RGB patch (list of lists of RGB triplets) that _init can resample into a 256×256 LUT.
- The shape property should be one of 'square', 'circle', 'ignore', 'circleignore'. The PNG doesn't obviously have a circular alpha mask (and Title doesn't imply one), so choose 'square' to avoid masking.
- Keep other attributes at their defaults used in the class: _rgba_bad and _rgba_outside as the default tuples, n_variates = 2, and origin (0,0).

Putting that together yields plausible input values:
- patch: a 2×2 list of RGB floats
- name: "BiCone"
- N: 256, M: 256
- _shape: "square"
- _rgba_bad: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
- _rgba_outside: [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
- _isinit: false (so _init will be invoked)
- n_variates: 2
- _origin: [0.0, 0.0]

These inputs are consistent with creation of a 256×256 PNG with Title "BiCone BivarColormap".
