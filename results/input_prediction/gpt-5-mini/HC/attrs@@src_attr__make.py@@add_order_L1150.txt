[THOUGHT]
1. add_order returns self and the observed output "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>" is the string representation of the returned _ClassBuilder instance, indicating its internal _cls was the class A. The representation does not require me to supply _cls in the provided structure — only the given fields must be filled.
2. add_order uses self._attrs (computed during __init__ from the original 'these') to generate ordering methods. If 'these' yields no attributes with order, _make_order will still produce the four ordering functions (they operate on an empty attrs list) and add them to the class dict; that's a valid, simple scenario.
3. The simplest consistent inputs are: auto_attribs = False, these = [] (no attributes to transform), has_custom_setattr = False. args and kwargs are empty.
4. These values match the minimal necessary state to call add_order and obtain the returned object whose repr shows cls=A in the output.
