1. The method world_to_pixel_values(self, *world_arrays) can be called with no args. In that case world_arrays == (), and the function builds world_arrays_new from sliced_out_world_coords for any iworld not in self._world_keep.

2. sliced_out_world_coords is produced by calling self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep)). To keep things simple and produce a near-zero pixel output (the given small numbers), it is sufficient that _pixel_to_world_values_all is invoked with zeros (e.g. pixel (0,0)) and that the WCS round-trip of those world coordinates back to pixel coordinates returns values very close to zero (small numerical noise).

3. To ensure the code paths are straightforward:
   - Make the WCS a 2D WCS: naxis = 2, _naxis = 2.
   - Use slices that are integers (fixed pixel positions) so _pixel_to_world_values_all will pass constant integers (0, 0) to the underlying WCS pixel_to_world_values. So set _slices_pixel = [0, 0].
   - Keep two pixels in the output: _pixel_keep = [0, 1].
   - Keep no world axes from the caller (caller provides no args), so _world_keep = [].
   - Other WCS init kwargs and pixel bounds can be null/None.

4. With these values, world_to_pixel_values() (called without args) will:
   - compute sliced_out_world_coords from pixel (0,0),
   - then call self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*sliced_out_world_coords),
   - which returns pixel coordinates very close to zero (matching the provided tiny numbers).
   This matches the observed output of two very small numbers.

5. Therefore the input structure fields (the XXX placeholders) can be filled as follows (using null for None and simple lists for slices and keeps).
