[THOUGHT]
1. The function returns a list of three 1D arrays (represented in the output as three lists of 5 floats). That matches the code path for a non-numpy iterable of iterables: the function will set is_1d=False and return result, where result contains each xi converted to a 1D numpy array via np.asanyarray(xi) and xi.reshape(-1).

2. Another possible path is passing a numpy array: if X were an ndarray, the function would transpose it and then return a list of rows. That would also produce three arrays of length 5, but the simplest input consistent with the output is passing X as a list of three iterables (lists) each containing the five floats shown.

3. The name argument is unused except in error messages, so any string is valid. I'll use "data".

4. Therefore the input X should be the list of the three lists exactly as in the output (fixing the stray quote in the provided output), and name set to "data".
