[THOUGHT]
1. The method _eval_expand_mul returns early in two places: if expr after fraction(...) is not a Mul it returns expr; otherwise, if there is nothing to rewrite (no additive factors), it returns expr as-is. The desired output "-sin(phi)**2" can be either a plain (non-Mul) expression or a Mul representing -1 * sin(phi)**2. Both would print as "-sin(phi)**2".
2. The simplest input Mul that yields that printed result is a product -1 * sin(phi)**2, i.e. Mul(-1, sin(phi)**2). fraction(Mul(-1, sin(phi)**2)) will give numerator representing that product and denominator 1; no Add factors will be found, so the function will return the Mul as-is, which prints "-sin(phi)**2".
3. The kwargs are hints passed through; they are not needed to get this output, so they can be left as null.
4. Therefore set self to represent Mul(-1, sin(phi)**2), leave args empty, and set all hint keys to null.
