[THOUGHT]
1. Inspect Basic.__eq__: the very first check is "if self is other: return True".
2. The simplest way to make __eq__ return True is to pass the exact same object as other (identity equality).
3. Therefore set "other" to the same value as "self". In the given structure "self" is an empty object {}, so set "other" to {} as well (representing the same object for this input).
