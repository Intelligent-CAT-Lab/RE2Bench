[THOUGHT]
We need a GridSpec with a single cell so that subplots() returns a single Axes (squeeze=True and axarr.size == 1 -> return axarr.item()).

1. For axarr.size == 1 we must have _nrows * _ncols == 1. The simplest choice is _nrows = 1 and _ncols = 1.
2. figure must be non-None so the code does not raise ("if figure is None: raise ValueError"). We can use a placeholder object (e.g. an empty dict) to represent the figure in this static prediction; the example solution used a dict for a callable placeholder.
3. sharex/sharey can be False (the code converts non-str booleans to 'none'/'all' and check_in_list accepts 'none'), squeeze must be True to trigger the single-item return, and subplot_kw can be None (the code replaces None with {} internally).
4. Other attributes (left, bottom, right, top, wspace, hspace, ratio lists) are not used in subplots() for this branch; provide typical numeric defaults and lists of length 1 for the ratios.

Given that, the input that would lead to returning a single Axes ("<Axes: >") is as below.
