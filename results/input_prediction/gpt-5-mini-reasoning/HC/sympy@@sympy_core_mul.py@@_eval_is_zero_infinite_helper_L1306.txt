[THOUGHT]
1. The function starts with seen_zero = seen_infinite = False.
2. To return (False, False) unchanged, no loop iteration may change either variable to True or None.
3. For each argument a:
   - If a.is_zero is truthy -> would set seen_zero = True. So a.is_zero must not be truthy.
   - If a.is_infinite is truthy -> would set seen_infinite = True. So a.is_infinite must not be truthy.
   - If neither truthy, the else branch checks for a.is_zero is None (would set seen_zero = None) and a.is_infinite is None (would set seen_infinite = None). To avoid setting to None, a.is_zero and a.is_infinite must be explicitly False (not None).
4. Therefore each argument must have is_zero == False and is_infinite == False. A single such argument suffices.
5. So provide self with args containing one object with those boolean properties; args and kwargs are empty per structure.
