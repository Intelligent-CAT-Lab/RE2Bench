[THOUGHT]
We need exprs that, after sympify and the parallel-polynomial conversion, produce:
- gens = [cos(phi)]
- domain = ZZ
- two polynomials: Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ') and Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')

Step-by-step reasoning through the function:
1. The function short-circuits only if both inputs are already Poly instances; to reach the later construction path, inputs should be SymPy expressions (Basic), not Poly objects.
2. sympify("2") -> Integer 2 (Basic). sympify("-2*cos(phi)") -> -2*cos(phi) (Basic with cos(phi) present).
3. Both are Basic and not is_Poly, so they are processed by _parallel_dict_from_expr, which will detect cos(phi) as the generator.
4. The representations (reps) produced will be:
   - for 2: constant term 2 (monomial degree 0)
   - for -2*cos(phi): monomial cos(phi)^1 with coefficient -2
5. construct_domain on the coefficient lists [2, -2] yields domain ZZ and integer coefficients.
6. Poly._from_dict then constructs Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ') and Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ').
This matches the given output.

Therefore the input exprs should be ["2", "-2*cos(phi)"], opt can be given as an empty dict as in the structure.
