[THOUGHT]
We need an input eq such that _mask_nc(eq) returns an expression whose string form is:
  sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)")) + 1
and the second/third returned values are empty mapping and null respectively (as shown in the output).

The routine returns (expr, {v: k for k, v in rep} or None, nc_syms). The simplest way to get the returned expr to look like sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1 is to supply eq that is exactly that expression: sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1. That matches the printed first element.

So the predicted input is the sympy expression representing sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1. Representing it as a string in the JSON input is consistent with prior examples.

Therefore set eq to "sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1".
