[THOUGHT]
The output "X[1, 2]" corresponds to a MatrixElement created by MatrixExpr.__getitem__ when indexing with two integer indices. In __getitem__, a non-slice 2-tuple key is sympified and passed to _entry, which (for a matexpr) returns a MatrixElement(self, i, j). Its string form is "X[1, 2]". Therefore the key must be the pair of indices (1, 2). In JSON I'll represent that as an array [1, 2].
