We must infer the inputs X, y and the instance attributes passed into BayesianRidge.fit that produced the given output.

1. The output shows X_offset_ = [2.88235294, 4.11764706]. Those are exact rationals:
   - 2.88235294 = 49/17
   - 4.11764706 = 70/17
   So n_samples = 17 and the sums of the two columns are 49 and 70 respectively.

2. A simple integer decomposition that matches those column sums with 17 rows is:
   - For column 0: fifteen 3's and two 2's => 15*3 + 2*2 = 49
   - For column 1: fifteen 4's and two 5's => 15*4 + 2*5 = 70
   Thus X can be 15 rows of [3, 4] and 2 rows of [2, 5]. This yields the exact X_offset_ shown, and X_scale_ = [1., 1.] when normalize=False.

3. From coef_ and intercept_ in the output we computed
   y_offset = intercept_ + dot(coef_, X_offset_) ≈ 2.576302957347 + 0.011933 ≈ 2.588235294117647 = 44/17.
   So the mean of y should be 44/17. A simple integer vector with mean 44/17 is ten 3's and seven 2's: 10*3 + 7*2 = 30 + 14 = 44.

4. The instance attributes in the output match the constructor defaults except compute_score=True, so set those accordingly. alpha_init and lambda_init are null.

5. sample_weight is not provided in the output, so set it to null.

Putting this together yields:
- self attributes: n_iter=300, tol=0.001, alpha_1=1e-06, alpha_2=1e-06, lambda_1=1e-06, lambda_2=1e-06, alpha_init=null, lambda_init=null, compute_score=true, fit_intercept=true, normalize=false, copy_X=true, verbose=false
- X: 17x2 array with fifteen [3,4] rows and two [2,5] rows
- y: list of 17 values: ten 3's and seven 2's
- kwargs.sample_weight: null

This input yields the given offsets and mean; it is a plausible reconstruction of the data that produced the reported attributes.
