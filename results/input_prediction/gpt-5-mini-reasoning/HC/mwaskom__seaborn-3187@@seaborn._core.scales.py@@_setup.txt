[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that would lead _setup to produce the shown attributes on the returned Scale (represented in the output).

- _setup begins with new = copy(self), so any fields in the returned object that are unchanged should be set on the input self. The output shows values: null, norm: null, trans: "log", so set those on self.
- The code only calls new.tick() if new._tick_params is None. The output shows a populated _tick_params dict (keys present with null values), so the input self must already have _tick_params set (not None) with those keys to avoid calling tick().
- Similarly, _label_params is present in the output; to avoid calling label() in _setup, have self._label_params already non-None with the shown keys (formatter, like, base, unit). The output's base is an empty object — mirror that.
- _legend in output is null, so set self._legend to null.
- _setup constructs a matplotlib scale and assigns it to new._matplotlib_scale; we don't need to reconstruct that fully in input because _matplotlib_scale is produced by the method. The input only needs to match fields the method would read: data.name (used as str(data.name) when calling _get_scale) and axis.update_units(data) — but the structure requires various Series internals. Provide minimal, neutral values (nulls/empty dicts) for these series internals.
- prop is expected by the method to expose attributes like normed, legend and method get_mapping. The provided structure only asks for prop.variable; to keep things neutral, set prop.variable to null.

These choices are the minimal, consistent values to result in the output shown (copying self, no tick/label modifications, trans preserved as "log", legend null, and neutral Series/prop placeholders).
