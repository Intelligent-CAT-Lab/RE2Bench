[THOUGHT]
1. euclidean_distances returns pairwise Euclidean distances between rows of X and Y. The output "[[1.1649954]]" is a 1x1 matrix, so X and Y must each have shape (1, n_features) with the same number of features.
2. check_pairwise_arrays and check_array require 2D arrays (ensure_2d=True), so use 1x1 arrays (shape (1,1)) for simplicity.
3. For 1x1 inputs, the distance is sqrt((x - y)^2) = |x - y|. To get 1.1649954, pick x = 1.1649954 and y = 0.0 (or any pair differing by 1.1649954). Use squared=False (the default) so the returned value is the square root, matching the output.
4. Therefore set X = [[1.1649954]], Y = [[0.0]], and squared = false.
