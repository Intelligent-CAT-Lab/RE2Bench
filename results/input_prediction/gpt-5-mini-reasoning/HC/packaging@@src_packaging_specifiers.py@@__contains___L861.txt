[THOUGHT]
1. __contains__ simply calls contains(item).
2. contains calls _coerce_version(item). To get True, _coerce_version(item) must return a valid Version (not None). Using a normal version string like "1.2.3" satisfies that.
3. With no specifiers (empty _specs) and _prereleases = None, filter(...) will:
   - see prereleases is None and self.prereleases is None, so prereleases stays None,
   - because self._specs is empty, go to the branch that, for prereleases None, collects non-prerelease versions into filtered and returns them (or prereleases if only prereleases found).
   - since "1.2.3" is not a prerelease, filtered will be non-empty, so filter yields the version and contains returns True.
4. Therefore set self._specs to empty, self._prereleases to null, and item to "1.2.3".
