We need inputs so polytope_integrate(...) returns "1/8".

Looking at the implementation, when poly is a Polygon the code computes hyperplane_parameters(poly) and facets = poly.sides, then calls main_integrate(expr, facets, hp_params). So we want to choose a simple polygon and polynomial expr whose double integral over that polygon equals 1/8.

Take the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (1,1). Its area is 1/2. In this triangle y ranges from 0 to x for x in [0,1]. Integrate expr = x*y over that triangle:

∫_{x=0..1} ∫_{y=0..x} x*y dy dx
= ∫_0^1 x * (x^2/2) dx
= 1/2 * ∫_0^1 x^3 dx
= 1/2 * (1/4) = 1/8

So expr "x*y" and a polygon corresponding to points (0,0),(1,0),(1,1) produce 1/8. The function has a clockwise flag; ordering doesn't affect the integral for this choice — set clockwise to false.

The provided structure only requires filling placeholders XXX for "expr" and "clockwise". (The "poly" field is left as {} per the structure template.)
