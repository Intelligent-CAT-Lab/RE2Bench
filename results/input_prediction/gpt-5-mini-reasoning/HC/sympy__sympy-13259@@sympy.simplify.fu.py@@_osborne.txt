[THOUGHT]
We need to find an input expression e such that bottom_up with f (which maps hyperbolic functions to trig ones) produces:
-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x) + I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)

Look at mapping in f:
- sinh(a) -> I*sin(a)
- cosh(a) -> cos(a)
- tanh(a) -> I*tan(a)
- a is replaced by a*d (or each term multiplied by d if a is an Add)

The output has two terms:
1) -I*sin(_Dummy_196*x) — this would come from -sinh(a) with a*d == _Dummy_196*x.
2) I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x) — this matches cosh(a)*tanh(a) transformed: cos(a) * I*tan(a) = I*cos(a)*tan(a), again with a*d == _Dummy_196*x.

The simplest choice is d = 1 so a == _Dummy_196*x. Therefore e should be:
 -sinh(_Dummy_196*x) + cosh(_Dummy_196*x)*tanh(_Dummy_196*x)

So the predicted input sets e to that expression.
