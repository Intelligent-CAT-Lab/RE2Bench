[THOUGHT]
We need to infer the inputs to make_blobs that produced the given (X, y).

1. Output shows two arrays: a 2D array with two columns and a 1D label array containing values 0,1,2. Counting the labels shows 50 entries, so n_samples was 50. The X array has 2 columns, so n_features = 2.

2. Labels use three cluster indices (0,1,2), so n_centers = 3. The numeric values in X are tightly grouped around coordinates near (0,0), (1,1), and around (0,~1.1) — that suggests that centers were explicitly provided near those points rather than randomly drawn from the default large center_box. A common choice that matches this pattern is centers = [[0,0], [1,1], [0,1]].

3. The spread of points around each center is fairly small but not tiny (some points deviate by ~0.2–0.3), so a cluster_std in the ~0.2–0.3 range is plausible. A typical example value is 0.2.

4. For reproducible output, a small integer seed is used; 0 is a common choice and would produce deterministic data. So random_state = 0.

Putting this together yields:
- random_state: 0
- n_samples: 50
- n_features: 2
- centers: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]
- cluster_std: 0.2

These inputs are consistent with the shown output (50 two-dimensional samples assigned to three clusters with small spread).
