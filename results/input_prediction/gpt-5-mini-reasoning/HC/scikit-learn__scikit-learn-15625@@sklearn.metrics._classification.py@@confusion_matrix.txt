[THOUGHT]
We need inputs y_true, y_pred, and sample_weight such that confusion_matrix returns a 2x2 matrix [[9,0],[0,11]].

1. The matrix [[9,0],[0,11]] is a perfect classification with 9 samples of class 0 correctly predicted and 11 samples of class 1 correctly predicted, and zero off-diagonal counts. So y_true must contain nine 0s and eleven 1s, and y_pred must be identical to y_true to produce zero off-diagonals.

2. If sample_weight is None, the function uses an array of ones (counts each sample equally). That yields integer counts as shown. So set sample_weight to null.

3. Using integer labels 0 and 1 is consistent with unique_labels sorting to [0,1] and yields the cm shape and values shown.

Therefore provide y_true and y_pred as lists with nine 0s followed by eleven 1s, and sample_weight as null.
