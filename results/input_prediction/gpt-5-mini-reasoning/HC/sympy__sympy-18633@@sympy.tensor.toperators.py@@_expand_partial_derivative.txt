[THOUGHT]
The method _expand_partial_derivative sets obj._indices, obj._free, obj._dum to the values returned by _contract_indices_for_derivative. The observed output has those three attributes as null (JSON null -> Python None). The simplest consistent input is that the PartialDerivative instance already has _indices, _free, and _dum set to None (and no args/kwargs). Therefore the input self should have those three fields as null.
