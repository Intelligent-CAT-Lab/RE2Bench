[THOUGHT]
We need to determine what arguments were passed to _preprocess_data given that its return (the "output") is the function shown as:
"function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs"

Looking at _preprocess_data:
- It is a decorator factory that, when given a real func, creates an inner() wrapper and applies functools.wraps(func), so the returned wrapper function will have the same __name__ and qualname as the original func.
- Therefore the returned function's name/qualname will be func.__name__ and func.__qualname__. The output indicates func.__name__ == "func_kwargs" and its qualname shows it was defined inside test_compiletime_checks (hence "test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs").
- The other two parameters, replace_names and label_namer, only affect validation assertions. To avoid triggering assertions, the simplest choice is to pass replace_names=None and label_namer=None. That satisfies the assertions (replace_names or [] check is bypassed when None; label_namer being None is allowed).
- Thus the input must supply func as the function object named "test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs" (represented here by the string "function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs"), and both replace_names and label_namer set to null.

So the filled structure is:
- func: "function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs"
- replace_names: null
- label_namer: null
