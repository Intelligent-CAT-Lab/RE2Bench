[THOUGHT]
We need an input expr such that radsimp(...) returns exactly "1/(a - b)". The simplest way is to pass the same rational expression 1/(a - b). Walking through radsimp:

- coeff, expr = expr.as_coeff_Add() will yield coeff 0 and expr equal to 1/(a - b) for expr = 1/(a - b).
- old = fraction(expr) gives (1, a - b).
- handle(expr) will process the denominator but since it's already a simple linear difference it will return unchanged, so n, d == (1, a - b).
- old == (n, d) so the function returns coeff + _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d), which evaluates to 1/(a - b).

Therefore choose expr = 1/(a - b), and keep symbolic and max_terms at their default values (True and 4) that are present in the function signature.
