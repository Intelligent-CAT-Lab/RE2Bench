We need extract to return an SDM whose internal dict is:
{0: {0: 1}, 1: {0: 1}, 2: {0: 1}}.

Looking at extract:
- The output keys 0,1,2 are the new row indices i2 (0..len(rows)-1), so len(rows) must be 3 and the rows argument should be [0,1,2] (or equivalent).
- The output has a single column index 0 in each row, so len(cols) must be 1 and cols should be [0].
- For each output row i2 to be filled, rowset & sdm1.keys() must include the corresponding original row i1. The simplest way is for the original SDM (self) to have nonzero entries at rows 0,1,2 and column 0, all with value 1: self == {0:{0:1}, 1:{0:1}, 2:{0:1}}.
- The bounds checks require shape = (m,n) with m > max(rows) and n > max(cols). Using shape (3,1) satisfies rows [0,1,2] and cols [0].
- Domain is unused in extract; any domain will do (use "QQ" as a conventional domain identifier).

Therefore pick:
- self.shape = [3, 1], self.rows = 3, self.cols = 1, self.domain = "QQ"
- args rows = [0,1,2], cols = [0]
- kwargs = {}

This input will produce the shown output.
