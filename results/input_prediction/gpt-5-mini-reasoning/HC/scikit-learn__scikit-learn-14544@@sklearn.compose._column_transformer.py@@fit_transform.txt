We need to produce inputs that would make ColumnTransformer.fit_transform return the 3x2 array [[0 2], [1 4], [2 6]].

- The result has two columns: first column [0,1,2], second column [2,4,6].
- A simple way to obtain this is to start from a single-column input X with values [1,2,3] and use two transformers applied to the same column:
  - transformer 1: subtract 1 → [0,1,2]
  - transformer 2: multiply by 2 → [2,4,6]
- The ColumnTransformer will apply both transformers to the same input column and horizontally stack their outputs to produce [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]].

Filling the provided structure:
- self.transformers: two transformer specs selecting column 0. I'll represent the first and second transformers as simple descriptive placeholders (one "minus1" and one "times2") since we only need to provide input values, not runnable objects.
- remainder: 'drop', sparse_threshold, n_jobs, transformer_weights, verbose set to common defaults.
- _columns: [[0], [0]] (both transformers use column 0).
- _n_features: 1 (single column).
- _remainder: ('remainder', 'drop', None).
- sparse_output_ False and empty transformers_ (not yet fitted).
- X: put the actual data values in the provided _attrs dictionary as values = [[1], [2], [3]] so it's clear what column data is being transformed.
- y: null.

This setup corresponds to the described computation that yields the given output.
