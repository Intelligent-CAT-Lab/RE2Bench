[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a (10 x 20) distance matrix, so n_samples_X = 10 and n_samples_Y = 20. Thus X must have shape (10, n_features) and Y shape (20, n_features).
2. The function signature allows XX and YY to be None; when they are None the function computes row norms internally. The simplest, valid input to reproduce the given output shape is to provide X with 10 rows and Y with 20 rows, and set XX and YY to null.
3. There are many possible X and Y that could produce the exact numeric matrix; the problem asks to fill the placeholders XXX in the structure — primarily the shapes and reasonable values. I'll supply concrete numeric arrays with shapes (10, 2) and (20, 2) (two features each) and set XX and YY to null. These inputs are consistent with the function's requirements and the observed output shape.
