[THOUGHT]
1. delete_parameter(since, name, func=None, **kwargs) will return a decorator if func is None; otherwise it processes func and returns the wrapper function (functools.wraps preserves the original function's name).
2. The observed output is "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>", i.e. the returned object is a function named "func2" defined in the local scope of a test function. That matches the wrapper returned by delete_parameter when given a real function object named func2 (wraps keeps the name "func2").
3. To produce that result we must call delete_parameter with func set to such a function (represented here by its stringified form), and provide some values for since and name. The exact since string and the parameter name don't affect the printed representation of the returned function object, so reasonable choices are used (e.g. since "3.1" and name "b").
4. Therefore the input has since "3.1", name "b", and func being the function object named "func2" (represented as "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2>").
