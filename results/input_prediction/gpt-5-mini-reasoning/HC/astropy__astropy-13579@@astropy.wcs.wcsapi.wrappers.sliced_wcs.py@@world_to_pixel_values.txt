[THOUGHT]
We need to find plausible values of the SlicedLowLevelWCS instance state that would produce a 2-element pixel result (two very small numbers near zero) when world_to_pixel_values is called with no positional arguments (args empty).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The call site shows no provided world_arrays (args is empty). Inside world_to_pixel_values, the code expects len(world_arrays) to equal the number of kept world axes (the count of indices in self._world_keep). Since no world_arrays were provided, self._world_keep must be empty (so all world coordinates are filled from sliced_out_world_coords).
2. The returned output contains two values, so the resulting pixel tuple must contain two elements. That implies that the WCS pixel dimensionality self._wcs.pixel_n_dim is 2 and that self._pixel_keep selects two pixel axes (e.g. [0, 1]).
3. sliced_out_world_coords is produced by calling _pixel_to_world_values_all with zeros of length len(self._pixel_keep). To have two output pixel coordinates, set _pixel_keep = [0, 1] and _slices_pixel to non-integer slice placeholders (so the function will use the provided zero arrays and .start is None), producing world_arrays_new entirely from sliced_out_world_coords.
4. The specific small numeric values in the output are consistent with a WCS that maps near-zero world values to near-zero pixel values; we don't need to reproduce exact WCS internals here, only provide consistent state: a 2D WCS (naxis = 2), no special _pixel_bounds, and empty keysel/colsel in _init_kwargs.

I therefore fill the XXX placeholders with consistent, simple choices:
- _wcs._init_kwargs.keysel and colsel: null
- _wcs.naxis and _naxis: 2
- _wcs._pixel_bounds: null
- _slices_array and _slices_pixel: two slice placeholders
- _pixel_keep: [0, 1]
- _world_keep: [] (empty, since no world args given)

These values are consistent with generating a 2-element pixel tuple (the two tiny numbers shown).
