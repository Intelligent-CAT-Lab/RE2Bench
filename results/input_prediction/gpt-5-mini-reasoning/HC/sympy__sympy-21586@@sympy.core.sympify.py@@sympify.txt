[THOUGHT]
We need sympify to return the expression whose printed form is "2500/pi". The code parses strings using sympy.parse_expr near the end, so the simplest input that yields that output is the string "2500/pi".

Important detail: for string inputs the function will raise SympifyError if strict is True (there is an explicit "if strict: raise SympifyError(a)" before the parsing step for strings). Therefore strict must be False to allow parsing.

So choose a = "2500/pi" and strict = False.
