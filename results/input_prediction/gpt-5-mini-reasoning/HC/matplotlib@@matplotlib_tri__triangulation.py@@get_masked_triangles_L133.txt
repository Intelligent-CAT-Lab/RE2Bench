We need to find the state of self such that get_masked_triangles() returns the given array of triangles.

The method returns:
- self.triangles[~self.mask] if self.mask is not None
- otherwise self.triangles

The output is a full list of triangle triplets (integers from 0 up to 24). The simplest explanation is that mask is None and triangles equals that exact array. For consistency, x and y must be 1D arrays of equal length at least max(triangles)+1. The largest index in the triangles is 24, so x and y must have length >= 25. We can use simple sequences 0..24 for x and y. Other attributes (_edges, _neighbors, _cpp_triangulation, _trifinder) can be None. is_delaunay is False because triangles were explicitly provided.

So set:
- x: [0, 1, ..., 24]
- y: [0, 1, ..., 24]
- mask: null
- _edges: null
- _neighbors: null
- is_delaunay: false
- triangles: the provided list-of-lists
- _cpp_triangulation: null
- _trifinder: null

No args or kwargs.
