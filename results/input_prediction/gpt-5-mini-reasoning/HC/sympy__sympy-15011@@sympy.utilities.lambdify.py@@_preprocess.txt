[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that produce the returned tuple (argstrs, expr) == (null, "sin(x)**2") shown in the output.

Looking at _preprocess:
- It starts with dummify = self._dummify; if not dummify, it sets dummify = any(isinstance(arg, Dummy) for arg in flatten(args)).
- It builds argstrs = [] and iterates over args, appending representations. If args is empty, the loop does nothing and argstrs remains [].
- It returns (argstrs, expr). So with an empty args sequence we get argstrs == [] and expr unchanged.

The output shows the second element "sin(x)**2", so expr must already be that SymPy expression (or its string representation). The first element is null in the provided output; that corresponds to the empty list returned for argstrs in this context.

Therefore the simplest input that matches the output is:
- self._dummify = False (so dummify is computed from args, but args is empty so dummify stays False)
- self._exprrepr = {} and self._argrepr = {} (empty dicts as in the structure)
- args.args is an empty list (no arguments)
- args.expr is the expression sin(x)**2

No kwargs are needed.

So the predicted input fills the XXX placeholders accordingly.
