[THOUGHT]
1. create_method(name, method) returns a wrapper manager_method decorated with @wraps(method). The wraps decorator sets the __wrapped__ attribute on the returned function to the original method.
2. The observed output shows {"__wrapped__": {}} — that indicates the returned function had a __wrapped__ attribute whose value is the original "method" object (represented here as {}).
3. The exact value of the "name" argument does not affect the presence of __wrapped__; it can be any valid method name from the queryset. I'll choose a common queryset method name ("filter") as the input for "name".
4. Keep "method" as {} (as represented in the output) and other fields empty dicts as in the structure.
