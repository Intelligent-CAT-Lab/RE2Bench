[THOUGHT]
The simplify function begins by sympifying the input. The observed output is "n + n**(-n)". This is the canonical SymPy print form for n + 1/n**n (SymPy represents 1/n**n as n**(-n)). If the input was "n + 1/n**n", sympify will yield an expression that simplify() will print as "n + n**(-n)". Therefore a plausible input is the string "n + 1/n**n" so that simplify returns the shown output.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "expr": "n + 1/n**n"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
