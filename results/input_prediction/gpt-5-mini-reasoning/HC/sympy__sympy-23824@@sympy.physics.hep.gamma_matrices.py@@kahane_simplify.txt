[THOUGHT]
We need an input expression for kahane_simplify that is consistent with the reported output object. The output shows a TensMul-like object whose main non-null numeric fields are:
- _rank: 2
- _ext_rank: 2
- _index_structure._ext_rank: 2
- _coeff: "1" (string in the output)
- _free_indices: "set()"
- _is_canon_bp: false

The simplest way to match that is to provide an input TensMul-like object whose index-related containers are empty or None (so they can be printed as null), with rank and ext_rank set to 2, an empty set of free indices, coefficient 1 and is_canon_bp False. This mirrors the returned structure and is the minimal/consistent input that could lead to the shown output after kahane_simplify processes it.

So in the input JSON we set the various index containers to null (None), _rank and _ext_rank to 2, _coeff to "1" (to match the output style), _free_indices to "set()", and _is_canon_bp to false. All other fields are null.
