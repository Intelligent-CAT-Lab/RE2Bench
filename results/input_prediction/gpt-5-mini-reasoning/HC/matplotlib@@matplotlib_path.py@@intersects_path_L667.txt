[THOUGHT]
intersects_path simply calls _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled) and returns its boolean result. To get True, choose two simple paths that clearly intersect:

- Self: a horizontal segment from (0,0) to (1,0). Codes: MOVETO (1) then LINETO (2).
- Other: a vertical segment from (0.5,-1) to (0.5,1). Codes: MOVETO (1) then LINETO (2).

These two segments cross at (0.5, 0) so path_intersects_path should return True. Fill the other fields with reasonable defaults: _interpolation_steps = 1, _simplify_threshold = 0.0, _should_simplify = false, _readonly = false. Set filled to true (the default).

Return the input JSON with self fields and other represented as a similar dict.
