[THOUGHT]
1. The output keys are tuples of length 4, e.g. (2,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0), ..., so m must be 4 (the multinomial tuples have length m).
2. Each tuple sums to 2 (e.g. 2+0+0+0 = 2, 1+1+0+0 = 2), so n must be 2.
3. For n=2, multinomial coefficients are 2!/(k1!...km!), so (2,0,0,0) -> 1 and (1,1,0,0) -> 2, matching the values in the output.
4. The number of entries should be C(n+m-1, m-1) = C(5,3) = 10, which matches the 10 entries shown.

Therefore the function was called with m = 4 and n = 2.
