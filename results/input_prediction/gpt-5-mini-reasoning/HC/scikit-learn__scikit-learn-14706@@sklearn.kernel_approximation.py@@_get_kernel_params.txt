We need _get_kernel_params to return {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}.

The method's logic:
- starts with params = self.kernel_params or {}
- if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':
    for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:
        if getattr(self, param) is not None:
            params[param] = getattr(self, param)
- else (if kernel callable or 'precomputed') and any of gamma/coef0/degree is not None -> raise ValueError

To produce exactly the two keys coef0 and degree:
- self.kernel must be a non-callable string that is not 'precomputed' and for which KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel] includes 'coef0' and 'degree' (e.g. "poly").
- self.coef0 must be 0.1 and self.degree must be 3.1.
- self.gamma must be None (so gamma is not added).
- self.kernel_params must be None (so params starts as {}), otherwise extra keys from kernel_params would appear in output.

Other fields can be None or arbitrary; they are not used by _get_kernel_params.

So choose kernel = "poly", gamma = None, coef0 = 0.1, degree = 3.1, kernel_params = None. Provide remaining attributes as nulls or defaults.
