We need to reconstruct the inputs to _fit_full so that its returned tuple matches the provided output.

Mapping the output to the return of _fit_full:
- _fit_full returns (U, S, Vt, X, x_is_centered, xp)
- The provided "output" list is:
  1) null -> U is None (this matches the covariance_eigh branch, which sets U = None)
  2) [31.71597905, 31.52929865] -> S (singular values)
  3) [[0.70710678, 0.70710678], [0.70710678, -0.70710678]] -> Vt
  4) a 6x2 array -> this is the original X that _fit_full returns
  5) false -> x_is_centered is False (covariance_eigh branch sets x_is_centered = False)
  6) the module string -> xp is the sklearn.externals.array_api_compat.numpy module

From the covariance_eigh branch in the function:
- _fit_svd_solver must be 'covariance_eigh' so that U is None and that branch is taken.
- The returned X shows shape (6, 2) so n_samples = 6, n_features = 2.
- To produce the provided outputs, n_components passed into the function should be an integer equal to 2 (so that singular values length is 2 and components cover both features). It's consistent to have both the instance attribute and the argument n_components be 2.

Other PCA instance attributes can be set to their typical defaults:
- copy: True
- whiten: False
- svd_solver: 'covariance_eigh' (consistent with _fit_svd_solver)
- tol: 0.0
- iterated_power: 'auto'
- n_oversamples: 10
- power_iteration_normalizer: 'auto'
- random_state: None
- n_features_in_: 2
- _fit_svd_solver: 'covariance_eigh'

Args:
- X is the 6x2 array exactly as shown in the output (the 4th element).
- n_components: 2
- xp: the module string shown as the 6th element of output
- is_array_api_compliant: False

Using these values reproduces the observed return tuple.
