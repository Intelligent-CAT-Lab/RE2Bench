[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (term, limits) for Product._eval_product that lead to the function returning NaN (printed as "nan").

Looking at the function start:
- limits is (k, a, n).
- First branch: if k not in term.free_symbols:
    - if (term - 1).is_zero: return S.One
    - else: return term ** (n - a + 1)

So an easy way to get NaN is to make term be NaN. For a NaN term:
- term.free_symbols is empty, so k not in term.free_symbols is True.
- (term - 1).is_zero is not true.
- The function then returns term ** (n - a + 1), i.e. NaN ** something, which evaluates to NaN.

Therefore choose term = NaN and simple integer limits so (n - a + 1) is defined, e.g. limits = ("k", 0, 0). That yields exponent = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1 and so NaN**1 -> NaN, matching the output.

        "term": "nan",
        "limits": [
            "k",
            0,
            0
        ]
    },
