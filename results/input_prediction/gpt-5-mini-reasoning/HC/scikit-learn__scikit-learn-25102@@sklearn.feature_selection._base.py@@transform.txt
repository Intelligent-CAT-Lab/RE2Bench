[THOUGHT]
1. transform calls _get_output_config and then _validate_data; nothing here forces pandas handling, so X will be converted to a numpy 2D array by check_array.
2. _transform uses mask = self.get_support() which delegates to self._get_support_mask(). For common univariate selectors (e.g. SelectPercentile/GenericUnivariateSelect) the mask is computed from percentile and scores_. To get both features selected, set percentile so that k = int(n_features * percentile/100) equals 2. With n_features_in_ = 2, percentile = 100 selects both features.
3. If mask is [True, True] and X is a 1x2 array [[0, 1]], then _safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1) returns [[0 1]], which matches the provided output.
4. Therefore choose percentile = 100, n_features_in_ = 2, scores_ = [1, 2] (so ranking selects both), pvalues_ = null, and X = [[0, 1]].
