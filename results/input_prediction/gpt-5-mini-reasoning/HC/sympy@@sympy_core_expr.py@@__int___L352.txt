[THOUGHT]
1. The __int__ implementation accesses self._mpf_. If self has no _mpf_ attribute, attribute access will raise AttributeError and the function will not return a value (observed output null).
2. To produce that behavior, provide a self object that does not have an _mpf_ attribute. A simple choice is an empty dict (which will raise AttributeError when attribute access is attempted).
3. args and kwargs are empty per the structure.

Thus set "self" to {}.
