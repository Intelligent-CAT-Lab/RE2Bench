We need inputs (positional args) such that delete_masked_points returns three items:
1) array [0.00, 0.05, ..., 0.45] (10 values)
2) array [0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95] (10 values)
3) null

delete_masked_points works by:
- taking nrecs = len(args[0])
- marking seqlist entries for args that are iterable and length == nrecs
- building masks from any masked arrays (~getmaskarray) and from np.isfinite(xd) for numeric arrays
- computing mask = logical_and.reduce(masks)
- igood = indices where mask is True; if len(igood) < nrecs, it slices all seqlist args with igood

So a straightforward way to produce the two returned 10-element arrays is:
- Provide two sequence arguments of equal length nrecs = 20.
- Make the boolean mask True for the first 10 indices and False for the last 10; then igood = [0..9] and both sequences get sliced to their first 10 entries.
- The third argument should be None so it is non-iterable and thus returned unchanged (null in JSON).

One simple construction:
- First argument: length-20 sequence whose first 10 entries are the desired first returned array (0.00..0.45) and whose last 10 entries are non-finite (NaN) so that np.isfinite is False there.
- Second argument: length-20 sequence whose first 10 entries are the desired second returned array (0.5..0.95). The last 10 entries can be anything (e.g., NaN) because those indices will be filtered out by the mask coming from the first argument.
- Third argument: None (null).

Representing NaN as null in the JSON input (so the interpreter producing these inputs would use np.nan for those positions) yields the intended behavior: the finite-mask coming from the first array is True for the first 10 entries and False for the last 10; both sequences are sliced to those first 10 entries and returned, and the third arg remains null.

Thus the positional args become:
- args[0]: [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
- args[1]: [0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
- args[2]: null

This input will produce the output shown.
