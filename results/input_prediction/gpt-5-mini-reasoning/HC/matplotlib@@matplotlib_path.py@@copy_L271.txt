[THOUGHT]
The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the Path instance, so the printed output must reflect the original object's attributes.

The output string is "Path([[0., 0.],1., 1.]], [1, 2])". This appears to be a slightly malformed representation but clearly intends vertices = [[0., 0.], [1., 1.]] and codes = [1, 2].

From the class:
- _interpolation_steps defaults to 1 (common default used in constructor).
- _update_values sets _simplify_threshold from mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'], and _should_simplify depends on that threshold and vertex count. With only 2 vertices (len(vertices) = 2 < 128), _should_simplify must be False regardless of threshold value > 0. To be safe and consistent we can use 0.0 for _simplify_threshold so that _should_simplify is False.
- _readonly is False by default unless readonly=True was passed to constructor.

So the original object's attributes that would produce the shown representation are:
- _vertices: [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]
- _codes: [1, 2]
- _interpolation_steps: 1
- _simplify_threshold: 0.0
- _should_simplify: False
- _readonly: False

These values are used in the input below.
