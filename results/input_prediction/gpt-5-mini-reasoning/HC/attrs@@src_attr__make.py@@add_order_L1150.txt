[THOUGHT]
We need an input for add_order that leads to the returned object being represented as "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>".

Looking at add_order:
- It does cd = self._cls_dict and then sets cd['__lt__'], '__le__', '__gt__', '__ge__' by applying self._add_method_dunders to each function returned from _make_order(self._cls, self._attrs).
- _make_order will always return four functions (it doesn't require any attrs to be present; it filters attrs by a.order but still defines and returns the comparison functions).
- The generator expression applies self._add_method_dunders to each function and assigns them; no error will occur if there are zero attrs with order=True.
- Finally add_order returns self; the observed output "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>" is the string representation of the returned builder object (showing that the builder's _cls is class A). The structure we must fill only exposes three constructor-related fields (auto_attribs, these, has_custom_setattr) — none of these need to cause an error for add_order to succeed.

Thus a minimal safe input is:
- auto_attribs: false
- these: [] (no attributes)
- has_custom_setattr: false

With these, add_order will successfully create and attach the four ordering methods and return self, which is shown as "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>".
