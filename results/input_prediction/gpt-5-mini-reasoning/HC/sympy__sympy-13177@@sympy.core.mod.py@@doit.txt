[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs to the inner function doit(p, q) that produce the output nan.

Looking at doit(p, q):
- The very first check is:
    if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
        return nan

So doit returns nan as soon as either p or q is nan, or either is infinite. The simplest way to guarantee a nan return is to set q to nan (or p to nan, or either to an infinite value). The provided file already imports nan from sympy.core.numbers, and the output given is "nan", so the most direct input producing that output is q = nan.

Therefore the predicted input sets q to nan.

{
    "self": {},

        "q": "nan"
