[THOUGHT]
The function args_cnc returns [c, nc]. When called with cset=True it converts c to a set and returns [set(c), nc]. The observed output's first element is "{'2'}", i.e. a set containing an element whose string form is "2". The second element is null (None), which corresponds to the nc value being an empty/absent value in the serialized output.

Therefore the call must have used cset = True so that the first returned value is a set containing the single argument (whose printed form is "2"). The structure only requires filling the XXX for cset.
