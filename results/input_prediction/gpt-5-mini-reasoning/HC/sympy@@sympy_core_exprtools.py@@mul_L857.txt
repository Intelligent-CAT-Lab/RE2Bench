[THOUGHT]
We need Term.mul to return Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})). mul computes:
- coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff
- numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)
- denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)
- then numer, denom = numer.normal(denom)
- return Term(coeff, numer, denom)

To get coeff == 1, choose self.coeff * other.coeff == 1. The simplest choice is self.coeff == 1 and other.coeff == 1.

To get numer and denom both empty Factors after multiplication and normalization, the simplest is to have both self.numer and other.numer be empty Factors, and both self.denom and other.denom be empty Factors. Their mul will be empty Factors, and normal will keep them empty.

So use two Term objects with coeff = 1 and empty Factors for numer and denom. In JSON we represent empty Factors as empty objects ({}).
