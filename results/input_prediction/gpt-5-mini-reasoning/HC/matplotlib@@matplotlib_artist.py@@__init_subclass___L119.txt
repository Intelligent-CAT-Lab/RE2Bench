[THOUGHT]
We need an input for __init_subclass__(cls) that, when the method runs, produces no output (None) and does not raise.

Looking at the method:

1. It first checks if cls.draw has attribute '_supports_rasterization'. If not, it replaces cls.draw with _prevent_rasterization(cls.draw). This requires cls to have a callable attribute draw (inherited from Artist is fine).

2. It then checks if cls.set has attribute '_autogenerated_signature'. If that attribute is missing, the method returns early. That also yields None (no output) and avoids any further changes.

Thus a simple subclass of Artist that inherits the default draw and set methods will satisfy both checks: it has draw and set attributes; draw will lack '_supports_rasterization' (so it gets wrapped) and set will lack '_autogenerated_signature' (causing the early return). Therefore providing such a subclass as cls is sufficient.

I'll represent the input class as a subclass named "SubArtist" (i.e., a subclass of Artist that didn't override draw or set), which is exactly the kind of object __init_subclass__ expects.
