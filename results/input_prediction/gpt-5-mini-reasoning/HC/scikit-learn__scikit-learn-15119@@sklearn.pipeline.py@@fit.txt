[THOUGHT]
We need inputs such that after calling fit the object's public attributes (transformer_list, n_jobs, transformer_weights, verbose) match the given output JSON:
{
    "transformer_list": null,
    "n_jobs": null,
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "verbose": false
}

The simplest way to produce that output is to call fit on a FeatureUnion instance whose attributes already have those values. The fit method returns self (early return if no transformers were processed), so the returned object's attributes remain as they were. Therefore set the input self attributes to the shown values.

The call's X and y are not constrained by the output, so set them to null. The kwargs field in the structure is a single key "a" — set it to null as well.

(Note: some combinations (e.g., transformer_list = null) would be invalid in real execution because _validate_transformers expects an iterable; here we simply match the observed output by setting the attributes to the shown values.)
