[THOUGHT]
We need an input expr that, after running exptrigsimp, results in an object whose serialized form shows a field "nargs" whose internal "_elements" is "frozenset({1})". That structure matches SymPy's FiniteSet(1) representation (FiniteSet stores its elements in a frozenset under _elements). A SymPy FunctionClass for unary functions (like sin, cos, exp) has nargs equal to FiniteSet(1). Therefore the final returned value must be the function class itself (e.g. sin), so its "nargs" attribute is FiniteSet(1) with _elements frozenset({1}).

Supplying expr = sin to exptrigsimp is consistent: bottom_up will apply the exp_trig function, but sin as a function class remains unchanged, and the returned object is the sin FunctionClass whose nargs is FiniteSet(1). That matches the given output showing nargs._elements = frozenset({1}).

So set expr to the sympy sin function (represented here as the name "sin").
