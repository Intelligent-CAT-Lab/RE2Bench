[THOUGHT]
We need which `_eval_evalf(self, prec)` was called to produce the output string "-0.e-1".

- The listed functions include sympy's numbers._eval_evalf which simply returns self unchanged.
- For the function to output the string "-0.e-1" the returned object must be a Float representing negative zero. SymPy formats a Float(-0.0) with a small precision as "-0.e-1".
- Therefore calling _eval_evalf on a numeric object that is negative zero will return that same object, and converting it to string (with prec=1) yields "-0.e-1".
- So the plausible input is self equal to a Float representing -0.0, and prec equal to 1.

I'll represent the Float as the string "-0.0" in the JSON structure and set prec to 1.

    "self": "-0.0",
