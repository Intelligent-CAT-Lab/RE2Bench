We need to find what input to StandardScaler.partial_fit would produce the given final attributes.

1. Look at partial_fit: for dense input it checks whether self has attribute 'n_samples_seen_'. If not, it initializes
   - mean_ = 0.0
   - n_samples_seen_ = 0
   - var_ = 0.0 (when with_std is True)
   and then calls _incremental_mean_and_var(X, self.mean_, self.var_, self.n_samples_seen_). Thus, the final mean_, var_ and n_samples_seen_ are just the mean, variance and number of samples of the provided X when starting from an empty state.

2. The provided output shows:
   - n_samples_seen_ = 179, so X must have 179 rows (samples).
   - mean_ and var_ are arrays of length 30, so X must have 30 columns (features).
   - scale_ is sqrt(var_) (consistent with code), so var_ values match the squared scale_ values.

3. Therefore a minimal input that produces the output is:
   - a StandardScaler instance with with_mean=True, with_std=True, copy=True, and no previously seen samples (so mean_, var_, n_samples_seen_, scale_ are not set / null).
   - X being a 2D array with shape (179, 30) whose column-wise means equal the given mean_ vector and whose column-wise variances equal the given var_ vector.

We cannot (and need not) enumerate all 5370 elements of X; it's sufficient to indicate that X is an array of shape (179, 30) with those column statistics. The initial scaler attributes must be absent (null) so partial_fit will compute the provided final values from X.

So the filled input JSON sets the scaler booleans, leaves the running stats null, and supplies X described as "array-like of shape (179, 30) with the given column means and variances".
