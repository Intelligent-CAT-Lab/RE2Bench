[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that make Mul._eval_pos_neg return None (JSON null).

Look at method logic:
- It loops over self.args. If the loop never returns/sets a definitive True/False, the final checks may return True (if sign == 1 and no NON/NOT flags) or False (if sign < 0). Otherwise the method falls off and returns None.
- The simplest way to get None is to have no arguments (self.args == ()), so the loop does nothing, and choose a sign value that is neither 1 nor negative (e.g., 0). Then:
  - saw_NON and saw_NOT remain False,
  - sign == 1 is false, sign < 0 is false,
  - so no return is triggered and the function returns None.

Thus choose self with empty args and sign = 0.
