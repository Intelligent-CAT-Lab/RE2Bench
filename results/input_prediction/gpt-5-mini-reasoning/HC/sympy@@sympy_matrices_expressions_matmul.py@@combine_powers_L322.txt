[THOUGHT]
We need an input 'mul' such that combine_powers returns a MatMul that prints as "X*Z".

- combine_powers calls factor, args = mul.as_coeff_matrices(). For a plain product X*Z, as_coeff_matrices() would return coeff = 1 and matrices = [X, Z].
- new_args starts as [args[0]] i.e. [X]. The loop then examines B = Z and, since there is nothing to combine or invert with X, it appends Z.
- newmul(1, X, Z) becomes MatMul(X, Z) and stringifies as "X*Z".

Therefore the simplest input representing the MatMul product is X*Z (or a MatMul object built from X and Z). I'll provide the input mul as the expression "X*Z".
