[THOUGHT]
We need to find the state of the HTTPDigestAuth instance and the method/url arguments that would produce the given Authorization header string from build_digest_header.

Given output:
Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460", opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The header starts with username="user" so self.username must be "user".
2. The realm, nonce, opaque, qop and algorithm values come from self.chal. So set:
   - chal['realm'] = "me@kennethreitz.com"
   - chal['nonce'] = "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
   - chal['opaque'] = "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"
   - chal['qop'] = "auth"
   - chal['algorithm'] = "MD5"
   (stale can be left null/None)
3. The code sets _algorithm = algorithm.upper() if algorithm provided; because the final header contains algorithm="MD5" and the code only appends algorithm when the original algorithm variable is truthy, we must supply algorithm = "MD5" (not None).
4. The uri in the header is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" so the URL passed to build_digest_header must have that path. Any scheme/host is acceptable; use "http://example.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".
5. The response and cnonce values are produced by the MD5 computations and cnonce generation in the function. For qop='auth' the code sets nonce_count to 1 when the current nonce is different from last_nonce. The header shows nc=00000001, so nonce_count must be set to 1 during the call. To achieve that, last_nonce must be different from the nonce provided in chal. The instance's last_nonce can be the empty string (default) so the code will set self.nonce_count = 1. We can set the instance's nonce_count initially to 0 (or any value not equal to what's required after the call); the function will set it to 1 internally. Provide nonce_count as 0 in the input state.
6. password must match what's used to compute the supplied response. The path includes "user/pass" and the typical example uses password "pass". So set self.password = "pass".
7. pos and num_401_calls are not used in build_digest_header; set pos to None and num_401_calls to 1.

Thus the inputs that correspond to the header are:
- self.username = "user"
- self.password = "pass"
- self.last_nonce = "" (so nonce != last_nonce -> nonce_count becomes 1)
- self.nonce_count = 0 (initial; function will set to 1)
- self.chal as above (realm, nonce, qop, opaque, algorithm)
- pos = None, num_401_calls = 1
- method = "GET" (common for such examples; A2 in header corresponds to GET)
- url = "http://example.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (path becomes /digest-auth/auth/user/pass)

These inputs match the header fields shown in the output.
