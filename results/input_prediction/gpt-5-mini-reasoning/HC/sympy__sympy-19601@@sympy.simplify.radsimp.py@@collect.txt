[THOUGHT]
1. The observed output is the string "_Dummy_373", which corresponds to a SymPy Dummy/symbol object with that name being returned by collect.
2. The simplest way for collect to return that object is for the input expression to already be that symbol (so after sympify the function just returns it).
3. Use default behavior for the other parameters: no func, evaluate True (so collect returns an expression rather than a dict), exact False, and distribute_order_term True. Pass an empty syms list.
4. Therefore set expr to "_Dummy_373", syms to an empty list, func to null, evaluate to true, exact to false, and distribute_order_term to true.
