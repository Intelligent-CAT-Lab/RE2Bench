[THOUGHT]
We need an input that causes the function to return a masked array with data [1., 2.], mask False, and fill_value 1e+20.

Walk through the function:
- If data is an instance of np.ndarray (MaskedArray is a subclass), the function will check structured dtype and complex dtypes; for a plain masked array of floats none of those branches apply, so execution continues.
- Then the function checks "if n_components == 1: return data". Thus, to return the masked array unchanged we should supply a masked array and set n_components to 1.

Therefore the input is a numpy masked array containing [1.0, 2.0] (no mask), and n_components equal to 1. I'll represent the masked array as "np.ma.array([1.0, 2.0])" in the JSON input.

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "data": "np.ma.array([1.0, 2.0])",
        "n_components": 1
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
