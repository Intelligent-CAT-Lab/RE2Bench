We need inputs to ContinuousBase._setup that would lead to the shown output snapshot of the returned "new" Scale object.

Key observations from the output:
- new.values is null, new.norm is null, new.trans is "log".
- new._tick_params and new._label_params are present as dicts with null entries (so these were not None when copied; they existed already).
- new._matplotlib_scale is set (it contains a nested _transform entry). This comes from new._get_scale(...) and assignment new._matplotlib_scale = mpl_scale.
- new._pipeline is present in code as a list of callables but not serializable to JSON; in the provided output it's null (consistent with being a non-serializable callable list).
- new._spacer is a function in the code; in output it's shown as {} (function object representation).
- prop.normed must be False (so normalize = None and vmin/vmax remain None), and prop.legend must be False (so the legend block is skipped and new._legend stays null).
- data.name is used when getting the scale; it can be any string — choose "values".

Therefore choose input where:
- self has values: null, norm: null, trans: "log"
- self._tick_params and self._label_params are dicts with the same null entries as in output (so new.tick()/label() do not need to be called)
- self._legend is null
- data is a minimal Series-like dict with _name "values" and other minimal fields
- prop.variable encodes the needed booleans normed: false and legend: false

This set of inputs is consistent with the code path producing the observed output structure (matplotlib scale created, pipeline set to a list of callables that serialize to null, spacer set to a function, and legend left null).
