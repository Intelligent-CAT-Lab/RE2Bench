[THOUGHT]
1. _mapping_repr starts by creating summary = [f'{title}:'], so title must be "Attributes" to get "Attributes:" as the first line.
2. With one mapping entry ("foo": value), and expansion enabled, the function will append the summarizer output for that single item as the next line.
3. _calculate_col_width(mapping) with a single key "foo" computes:
   - max_name_length = len("foo") = 3
   - col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 13
4. summarize_attr builds k_str = "    foo:" (four spaces, "foo", colon) length 8. pretty_print pads it to col_width (13), adding 5 spaces -> "    foo:     ".
   Then a single space is added before v_str, so total spaces between ":" and the value become 5 + 1 = 6.
5. To produce the line "    foo:      bar" the value must be "bar".
6. expand_option_name must cause expansion to be True; using the common option name "display_expand_attrs" will do that in normal configuration.

Therefore the inputs are: mapping {"foo": "bar"}, title "Attributes", summarizer left as {} (per structure), expand_option_name "display_expand_attrs".
