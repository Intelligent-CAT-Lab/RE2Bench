1. The final output of score_samples is [-0.79370053, -0.79370053]. Inside IsolationForest._score_samples the method returns -self._compute_chunked_score_samples(X). Therefore the computed (positive) scores from _compute_chunked_score_samples must be [0.79370053, 0.79370053].

2. The scoring formula in _compute_score_samples is:
   scores = 2 ** (- depths / denominator)
   So we need 2 ** (-depths/denominator) = 0.79370053. Recognizing 0.79370053 = 2^{-1/3}, we get depths/denominator = 1/3.

3. The simplest integer choice is depths = 1 for each sample and denominator = 3. denominator is computed as len(self.estimators_) * average_path_length_max_samples. The average path length for max_samples = 2 is 1 (c(2) = 1), so to get denominator = 3 we choose len(self.estimators_) = 3.

4. The output array length is 2, so X must have n_samples = 2. To make subsample_features False (so features passed as None in the tree-depth computations) we set _max_features equal to X.shape[1] = 1. So X can be a 2x1 array (e.g., [[0.0],[0.0]]).

5. Summarizing choices to be consistent with the internal attributes used by the code:
   - _max_samples = 2 (gives average_path_length_max_samples = 1)
   - estimators_ is a list of length 3
   - depths will end up as [1,1] (producing the desired score)
   - _max_features = 1 and n_features_in_ = 1
   - n_samples = 2 (X has 2 rows)

6. Fill the remaining attributes with sensible placeholders (None/null for estimator-like objects, simple ints/lists for seeds, etc.) so that the structure is complete and consistent.

These values will produce the reported output when the method's computations are carried out as described above.
