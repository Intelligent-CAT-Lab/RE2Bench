[THOUGHT]
We need an expr such that handle(expr) returns the SymPy expression 1/(a - b).

Walk through handle when expr = 1/(a - b):
- fraction(expr) yields n = 1, d = a - b (d is an Add).
- expr.is_Atom is False; (d.is_Atom and n.is_Atom) is False because d is Add, so it doesn't return early.
- n is S.One, so branches for non-1 numerator are skipped.
- d is not a Mul; symbolic defaults to True so symbolic/d.free_symbols checks don't short-circuit.
- d.is_Add is True, so the routine proceeds to the loop that collects square-root-like terms and may transform numerator/denominator, but with a simple denominator a - b the loop will quickly find n and d unchanged.
- At the end handle returns _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d), i.e. 1/(a - b).

Therefore the simplest input that produces the given output is expr = 1/(a - b).
