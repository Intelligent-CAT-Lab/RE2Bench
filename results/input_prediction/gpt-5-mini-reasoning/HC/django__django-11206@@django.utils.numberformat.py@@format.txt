[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that cause format(...) to return the given big negative integer string.

Look at the function:
- If number is an int, and not use_grouping, and decimal_pos is not set, it returns mark_safe(number) immediately. That will yield the string representation of the integer (wrapped as a SafeString), matching the output form (a plain integer string with a leading '-').

- use_grouping depends on settings.USE_L10N and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR and on grouping/force_grouping. With use_l10n omitted (None) and default Django settings (USE_L10N False, USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR False), use_grouping will be False. Also we are not passing decimal_pos (it's None). So the early int branch applies.

Therefore the simplest input is to pass the large negative integer (as a Python int) exactly equal to the output string, and any decimal_sep (unused) such as ".". kwargs is empty and self is an empty object as required by the structure.

So set:
- number = -3595386... (the full integer from the output)
- decimal_sep = "."

No other parameters are needed.
