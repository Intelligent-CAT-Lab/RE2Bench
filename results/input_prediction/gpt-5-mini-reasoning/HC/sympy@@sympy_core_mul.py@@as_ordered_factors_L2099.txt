[THOUGHT]
1. as_ordered_factors calls self.args_cnc() to get (cpart, ncpart).
2. It then sorts cpart using each expr.sort_key(order=order) and returns cpart + ncpart.
3. The final returned list is ["w", "z"]. That means the concatenation cpart + ncpart produced two expressions whose string forms are "w" and "z", and ncpart must be empty (otherwise there would be more items).
4. Therefore cpart after sorting is ["w", "z"]. We can represent the Mul-like self as having those argument symbols available (here represented simply as args = ["w", "z"]).
5. The order argument was not required to be anything special to produce this output, so set order to null.
6. Fill the structure with self containing the args (["w","z"]), order null, and empty kwargs.
