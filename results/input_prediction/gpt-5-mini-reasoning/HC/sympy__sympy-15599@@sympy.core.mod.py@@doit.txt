[THOUGHT]
We need arguments to the inner doit(p, q) that make it return S.Zero, whose printed representation is "0".

Looking at doit:
- It first raises on q == S.Zero (not desired).
- It returns nan in some infinite/nan cases (avoid).
- It immediately returns S.Zero if p == S.Zero or p == q or p == -q or (p.is_integer and q == 1).

The simplest and most robust choice is to make p equal to zero. That triggers the p == S.Zero branch and returns S.Zero regardless of q (as long as q isn't S.Zero or nan/infinite). So choose p = 0 and pick a normal nonzero integer for q, e.g. 3.

Thus:
p = 0
q = 3
