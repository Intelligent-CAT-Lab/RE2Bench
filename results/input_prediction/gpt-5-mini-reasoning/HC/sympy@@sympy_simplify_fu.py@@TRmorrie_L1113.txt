[THOUGHT]
1. bottom_up(rv, f) applies f to every subexpression bottom-up.
2. f only changes expressions where rv.is_Mul is True; otherwise it returns the node unchanged.
3. For rv = cos(phi): bottom_up will recurse into the argument phi (which is unchanged), then call f on cos(phi). Since cos(phi).is_Mul is False, f returns cos(phi).
4. Therefore the simplest input that yields the output "cos(phi)" is rv = cos(phi) itself.
