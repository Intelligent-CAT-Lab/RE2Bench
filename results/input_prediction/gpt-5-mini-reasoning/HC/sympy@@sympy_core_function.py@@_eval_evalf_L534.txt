[THOUGHT]
We need to pick values for self.nargs and prec (the single argument to _eval_evalf) so that the method returns a numeric result whose string form matches "1.5430806".

Reading the method:
- It takes a precision argument "prec".
- If _eval_mpmath is not defined, it looks up a function in the mpmath module by name and uses self.args as arguments.
- It converts the arguments to mpmath numbers with extra 5 bits of precision, calls the mpmath function inside mpmath.workprec(prec), and then returns Expr._from_mpmath(v, prec) which creates a sympy Float with the given binary precision. The printed decimal form of that Float will reflect the requested precision.
- The output "1.5430806" has 8 significant characters (1 digit before decimal + 7 after the decimal point), which is consistent with calling _eval_evalf with prec = 7 (often testcases use small integer prec values like 7).

nargs only needs to reflect the number of arguments the Function instance would have; one argument is the common simple case.

Therefore the minimal plausible input is:
- self.nargs = 1
- prec = 7
- kwargs is empty

This is the simplest assignment consistent with producing a Float that prints as "1.5430806".
