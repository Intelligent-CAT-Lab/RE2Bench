The printed Matrix is a 2x2 block matrix whose entries are themselves Matrix objects. Reading the output:

- Top-left block is Matrix([[4, 2],
                           [2, 3],
                           [7, 5]]) — a 3x2 matrix.
- Top-right block is Matrix([[1, 1, 1],
                            [1, 1, 1],
                            [1, 1, 1]]) — a 3x3 matrix.
- Bottom-left block is Matrix([[1, 0],
                              [0, 1]]) — a 2x2 matrix (identity).
- Bottom-right block is Matrix([[1, 2, 3],
                               [3, 5, 4]]) — a 2x3 matrix.

BlockMatrix.__new__ receives cls and a single argument: a sequence of rows, where each row is a sequence of Matrix objects. Thus the input args should be a single-item tuple/list containing the 2-row list of block matrices:

[
  [
    [ [4,2],[2,3],[7,5] ],    [ [1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1] ]
  ],
  [
    [ [1,0],[0,1] ],          [ [1,2,3],[3,5,4] ]
  ]
]

So set "cls" to "BlockMatrix", "args" to a list with that rows structure, and kwargs empty.
