[THOUGHT]
We need an input such that simple_tag returns {} (the provided output). In the code, simple_tag behaves like this:
- If func is None: returns the decorator function dec (a callable), not an empty dict.
- If func is callable: returns dec(func) which registers the tag and returns the original func.
- Otherwise: raises ValueError.

The only way the function returns the given value is when func is a callable and simple_tag returns that callable. In the JSON representation used in the examples, a callable is represented as {}. So the input must be a Library instance with empty filters and tags, and a callable passed as func (represented here as {}), and no kwargs.

Therefore the input is the Library with empty dicts for filters/tags, func as a callable (represented as {}), and empty kwargs.
