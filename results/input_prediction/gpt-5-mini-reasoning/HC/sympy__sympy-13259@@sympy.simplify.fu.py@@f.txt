[THOUGHT]
1. The nested function f returns its argument unchanged if it is not an instance of TrigonometricFunction:
   if not isinstance(rv, TrigonometricFunction):
       return rv
2. The observed output is the expression "_Dummy_163*x". That matches the form of a SymPy Mul (Dummy_163 * x).
3. Therefore f must have been called with rv equal to that expression, so rv == _Dummy_163*x.
4. In the JSON input structure we represent that SymPy expression as the string "_Dummy_163*x".
