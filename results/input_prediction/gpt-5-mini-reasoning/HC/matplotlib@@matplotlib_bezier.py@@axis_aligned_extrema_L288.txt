[THOUGHT]
We need the input (the BezierSegment instance state) that leads axis_aligned_extrema() to return (array([],), array([])).

Look at axis_aligned_extrema:
- It computes n = self.degree, where degree = self._N - 1.
- If n <= 1 it immediately returns (np.array([]), np.array([])).

So the simplest way to get the given output is to make degree <= 1, i.e. set _N <= 2. I'll pick _N = 2 (two control points) which makes degree = 1, triggering the early return.

The object's other fields should be consistent with a 2x2 control points array:
- _cpoints: a (2, d) array; choose d = 2 for a 2D curve, e.g. [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]].
- _N = 2
- _d = 2
- _orders = np.arange(_N) -> [0, 1]
- _px: computed as (cpoints.T * coeff).T; for _N=2, coeff = [1, 1], so _px equals _cpoints. I'll set _px = same as _cpoints.

args and kwargs are empty for axis_aligned_extrema().

This state will make axis_aligned_extrema return two empty arrays as required.
