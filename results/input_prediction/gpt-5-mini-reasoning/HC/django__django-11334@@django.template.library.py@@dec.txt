[THOUGHT]
1. The decorator factory simple_tag returns dec when called without a func argument. dec is later called with the user function being decorated.
2. The provided output shows the decorated function's attributes. Those map directly to the input func object's metadata:
   - __module__ is "template_tests.test_library".
   - __name__ is "func".
   - __qualname__ indicates the test and nested scope: 'SimpleTagRegistrationTests.test_simple_tag_wrapped."<locals>".func'.
   - __doc__ is null (no docstring).
   - __annotations__ is an empty mapping.
   - __wrapped__ is an empty mapping in this observed state.
3. Therefore the dec input function must have those exact attribute values; self and kwargs are empty in this call.

Based on that, fill the structure accordingly.
