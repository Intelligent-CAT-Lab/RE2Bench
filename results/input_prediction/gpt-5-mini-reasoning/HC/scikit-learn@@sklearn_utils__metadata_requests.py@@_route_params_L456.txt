We need inputs to MethodMetadataRequest._route_params that produce a returned Bunch (res) with keys "sample_weight" -> [1] and "metadata" -> "a".

Step-by-step through the function:
1. _route_params calls self._check_warnings(params=params). To avoid complications from WARN aliases, ensure neither request maps to WARN.
2. params is filtered to args = {k: v for k, v in params.items() if v is not None}. To get both keys in the result, params must include "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a" (not None).
3. For each prop, alias in self._requests:
   - If alias is False or alias == WARN: the prop is skipped (not desired).
   - If alias is True and prop in args: res[prop] = args[prop] (this will put the required key/value into res).
   - If alias is None and prop in args: prop would be considered unrequested and an exception would be raised (not desired).
   - If alias is a string and that alias is a key present in args: res[prop] = args[alias] (also would populate res).
4. The simplest way to ensure res contains both keys and no exception is to have both request aliases be True (or aliases that map to existing keys). So set self._requests = {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}.
5. owner and method can be any values (strings suffice) because no error/warning path is triggered.
6. Set parent and caller to any strings (used only if error constructed).

Thus the input params should include sample_weight: [1], metadata: "a", and the request mapping should mark both as requested (True). kwargs is empty.

This yields the returned res containing the two required entries.
