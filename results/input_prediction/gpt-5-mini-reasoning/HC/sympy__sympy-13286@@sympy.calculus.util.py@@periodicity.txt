[THOUGHT]
1. The function periodicity returns 2*pi when it determines the period of a trigonometric function whose inner argument is exactly the symbol of periodicity. In TrigonometricFunction._period, if the inner argument f == symbol it returns the general_period (which for trig functions is 2*pi).
2. If we pass f = sin(x) and use symbol = x (the code can infer symbol from free_symbols if symbol is not explicitly provided), periodicity will call f.period(symbol) and that will return 2*pi.
3. Therefore the input f that yields the output "2*pi" is sin(x). I'll supply f as the expression "sin(x)".
