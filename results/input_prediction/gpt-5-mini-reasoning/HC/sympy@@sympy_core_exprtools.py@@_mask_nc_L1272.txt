[THOUGHT]
1. The function sets expr = eq and immediately checks if expr.is_commutative. If that is True, it returns (eq, {}, []).

2. The given output is ["2 - 2*cos(phi)", {}, []], so the function must have taken eq equal to the expression that prints as "2 - 2*cos(phi)" and found it commutative, causing the early return and producing an empty mapping and empty nc_syms list.

3. The name argument is irrelevant because the early return occurs before any use of the name (the defaulting to 'mask' or the numbered-name generator isn't needed).

4. Therefore the input eq should be the expression "2 - 2*cos(phi)" and name can be null (omitted/default).

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "eq": "2 - 2*cos(phi)",
        "name": null
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
