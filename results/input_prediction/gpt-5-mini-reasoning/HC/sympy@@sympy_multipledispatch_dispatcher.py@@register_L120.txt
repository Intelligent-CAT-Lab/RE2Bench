[THOUGHT]
- The register method returns the inner function "_" defined inside it (a decorator). The observed output "<function Dispatcher.register.<locals>>" is exactly that inner function object being returned.
- That return value does not reveal what types were passed to register — register always returns the inner function regardless of the *types arguments. Therefore the types could be anything (including none).
- The simplest and most likely minimal call is register called with no types. I'll represent that as an empty list for the variadic types.
- `self` must be an instance of Dispatcher. I'll represent it as a dict containing the Dispatcher attributes (__name__/name, funcs, ordering, _cache, doc) with typical initial values.
