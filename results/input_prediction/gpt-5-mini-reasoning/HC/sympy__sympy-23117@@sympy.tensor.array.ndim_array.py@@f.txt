[THOUGHT]
We need the input "pointer" for the nested function f(pointer) defined in _scan_iterable_shape.

In the code f(pointer) does:
- if not isinstance(pointer, Iterable):
    return ([pointer], ())
- if len(pointer) == 0:
    return ([], (0,))
- otherwise it recurses over elements.

To produce the observed output (first element serialised as null, second as an empty list/tuple), choose a non-iterable pointer whose Python value is None. For pointer = None, f returns ([None], ()), i.e. a list containing None and an empty tuple. Serialized to JSON this corresponds to null for the contained value and an empty array for the empty tuple, matching the provided output structure.

Thus pointer should be None.
