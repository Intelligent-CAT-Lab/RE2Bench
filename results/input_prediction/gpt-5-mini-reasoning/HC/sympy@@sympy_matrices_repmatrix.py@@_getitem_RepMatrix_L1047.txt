[THOUGHT]
We need _getitem_RepMatrix to return cos(phi). The function first checks if key is a tuple; if so it calls self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j)) and returns that result unless a TypeError/IndexError occurs. The simplest way to get "cos(phi)" is:

- Use a tuple key (0, 0) so the tuple branch is taken and index_(0) -> 0.
- Ensure self._rep has a getitem_sympy that (when called with (0,0)) yields cos(phi).
- rows and cols must be positive (so indices are valid) but they are not consulted when the try succeeds.

So set rows and cols to 1, set _rep to an object representation that indicates getitem_sympy returns "cos(phi)", and set key to [0, 0] (JSON array representing the tuple of indices). kwargs is empty.
