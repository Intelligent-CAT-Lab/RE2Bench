[THOUGHT]
We need to find the input such that Set._complement(other) produced an object whose _elements is frozenset({1}).

Looking at the _complement implementation, the FiniteSet branch does:
- define ternary_sift(el) returning self.contains(el) if that is True/False else None
- compute sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
- return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)

The final result containing _elements frozenset({1}) corresponds to a FiniteSet with single element 1. That would come from sifted[False] == [1] and sifted[None] empty, so the Union simplifies to just FiniteSet(1). For sifted[False] to contain 1, ternary_sift(1) must have returned False, i.e. self.contains(1) evaluated to False (meaning 1 is not in self). Therefore "other" must be a FiniteSet whose _elements are frozenset({1}).

The minimal inputs consistent with this are:
- self: an unspecified Set instance (empty in the structure)
- other: a FiniteSet with _elements = frozenset({1})
- kwargs: empty

So the input fills XXX with frozenset({1}).
