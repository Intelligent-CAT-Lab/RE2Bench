[THOUGHT]
We need an _args list of (expr, cond) pairs that the function will collapse into two ExprCondPair entries:
  (1, x < 0)
  (3, True)

The function iterates over the provided _args in order. For simple relational conditions (x < 0) and boolean True, nothing in the code forces them to be removed or merged (no duplicates, no And-processing needed). Therefore the simplest input that yields the given output is just two pairs:
  (1, x < 0) and (3, True)

So we provide _args as a list with those two pairs. The surrounding self and kwargs are empty as requested by the structure.
