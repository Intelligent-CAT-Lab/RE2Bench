We need to reconstruct the input X that, after SimpleImputer.transform, produced the given output.

1. The transform method uses self.statistics_ to fill missing values (default strategy 'mean'), and the final output has 4 columns, so statistics_ must be a length-4 array of imputed values that appear in the output:
   - Observed imputed values in the output are 5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222.
   - So statistics_ = [5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222].

2. Any entry in the output that equals statistics_[col] was originally missing (np.nan) in the input and was replaced with the corresponding statistic during transform. Thus we can reconstruct X by taking the output and replacing occurrences of those statistic values with missing markers (I will use null to represent np.nan in JSON).

3. Other SimpleImputer attributes: default missing_values is np.nan, strategy is 'mean', add_indicator is False (because the transform output had only the original 4 columns and no extra indicator columns), keep_empty_features is False (default), fill_value is None, copy True, n_features_in_ is 4, _fit_dtype and _fill_dtype are float64. indicator_ can be null because add_indicator is False and it's not used.

4. Build X: for each cell in the output, if the cell equals the column statistic, replace it with null; otherwise keep the value. This yields the input X below.

(Representation choices: use "np.nan" as the missing_values marker name, and use null in X to represent np.nan positions.)
