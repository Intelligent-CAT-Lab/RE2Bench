[THOUGHT]
1. The returned "output" is a 3-item list: [mat, pivot_cols, swaps]. pivot_cols is [0,1,2] and swaps is []. That indicates three pivots found in columns 0,1,2 with no row swaps. So pivots were found at successive pivot rows 0,1,2.
2. The mat in the output is a flat list of 9 entries, so rows*cols = 9. With three pivot columns, the most natural choice is rows=3, cols=3.
3. The final flattened matrix entries correspond (row-major) to:
   row0: -9, -17, -19
   row1: 0, -8, -37
   row2: 0, 0, -243
   Because no swaps occurred and the pivot positions are the diagonal entries, it's consistent that the input matrix was already upper-triangular and no elimination changed it.
4. Note: normalization at the end of the function (normalize_last and normalize) would set the pivot entries to `one`. The returned matrix still has pivot values -9, -8, -243, so final normalization was not applied. That matches normalize_last = True (default) but normalize = False (so the final pass is skipped). Also we do not need row-normalization during pivot selection, so leaving normalize False ensures the pivot entries remain as in the input.
5. iszerofunc and simpfunc are the functions used by the routine; based on the implementation they are typically _iszero and _simplify (or equivalents). We provide their names as identifiers (string) consistent with the context.
6. "one" can be 1 (the multiplicative identity used if normalization were to occur).

Based on these deductions, the input parameters are:
- mat: [-9, -17, -19, 0, -8, -37, 0, 0, -243]
- rows: 3
- cols: 3
- one: 1
- iszerofunc: "_iszero"
- simpfunc: "_simplify"
- normalize_last: true
- normalize: false
- zero_above: true
