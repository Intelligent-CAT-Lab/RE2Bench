[THOUGHT]
We need build_class to return the original class A so the printed output is "<class '__main__.A'>". Looking at build_class:

- It first calls _eval_snippets (harmless if there are no snippets).
- Then it checks `if self._slots is True:`. If True, it would create a new slotted class; otherwise it calls _patch_original_class() which applies methods to and returns self._cls (the original class).
- To get "<class '__main__.A'>", we want the non-slotted path so the original class object (self._cls, which is class A in __main__) is returned.

Thus we need a builder state representing a typical non-slotted attrs builder. The provided structure only requires filling auto_attribs, these and has_custom_setattr. Reasonable values for a non-slotted builder are:
- auto_attribs: false
- these: an empty list
- has_custom_setattr: false

With those settings the builder will not be slotted and will return the original class object, matching the observed output.
