[THOUGHT]
1. add_attrs_init returns self (see end of method: "return self").
2. The provided output is the string representation of the returned _ClassBuilder instance: "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>". That means the builder's _cls has name "A" (this is set earlier during initialization).
3. The STRUCTURE asks only for the three fields on self: auto_attribs, these, has_custom_setattr. Any reasonable values that allow add_attrs_init to run (it will call _make_init_script internally) are acceptable; minimal/safe choices are:
   - auto_attribs: false
   - these: [] (empty list of attributes)
   - has_custom_setattr: false
4. With those inputs, add_attrs_init will generate the init script for zero attrs, append the snippet, and return self whose repr matches "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>" (cls was provided earlier as A by the test harness).
5. Therefore fill the XXX placeholders with these values.
