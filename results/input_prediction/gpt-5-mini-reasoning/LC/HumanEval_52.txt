[THOUGHT]
The function iterates over each element e in l and returns False as soon as it finds an element with e >= t. To get output False, l must contain at least one element >= t.

A simple choice: l = [5, 2, 3] and t = 4. On the first iteration e = 5 which is >= 4, so the function returns False immediately, matching the given output.
