[THOUGHT]
1. The setup(app) function always executes the same sequence: it calls app.add_transform five times (with PreserveTranslatableMessages, Locale, TranslationProgressTotaliser, AddTranslationClasses, RemoveTranslatableInline) and then returns the constant metadata dict {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}.
2. The returned output shown matches that constant return value and does not depend on the specific app instance, other than the app having an add_transform method so the calls succeed.
3. Therefore any Sphinx-like app object with an add_transform method would be a valid input. I'll represent the app as a minimal Sphinx-like object describing that it has an add_transform callable.
4. Fill the XXX in the provided structure with such a minimal app representation.
