We need to find inputs so that _polynomial_integrate returns -1/8.

From the function:
- dims = (x,y) -> dim_length = 2.
- It loops over polynomials; for degree deg it computes poly_contribute = sum_over_hp( integration_reduction(...) * (hp[1] / norm(hp[0])) ), then divides poly_contribute by (dim_length + deg), and adds to integral_value.

So to get integral_value = -1/8 with a single degree (deg = 2), we need:
poly_contribute / (2 + 2) = -1/8  =>  poly_contribute / 4 = -1/8  =>  poly_contribute = -1/2.

If we use a single hp in hp_params, we need:
value_over_boundary * (hp[1] / norm(hp[0])) = -1/2.

A convenient choice is hp[1]/norm(hp[0]) = 1, so value_over_boundary must be -1/2.
Take hp[0] = (1,0) and hp[1] = 1 (norm((1,0)) = 1).

Now we must make integration_reduction(...) return -1/2 for the top-level call with degree=2.
Consider a simple facet configuration: two segments sharing a vertex at (1,0):
- facet 0: points [(0,0),(1,0)]
- facet 1: points [(1,0),(1,1)]
For index=0, left_integral2D will find the shared vertex (1,0), compute distance_origin = norm((1,0)-(0,0)) = 1, and add expr.subs({x:1,y:0}) * distance_origin = expr(1,0).

integration_reduction does:
value = left_integral2D(...) (if inner_product term is zero).
Then returns value / (len(dims) + degree - 1) = value / (2 + degree - 1) = value / (degree + 1).

So for degree=2 it returns expr_at_point / 3. To get value_over_boundary = -1/2 we set expr_at_point = -3/2 (a constant polynomial -3/2). Then integration_reduction returns (-3/2) / 3 = -1/2.

With hp ratio =1, poly_contribute = -1/2, then dividing by (2+2)=4 yields -1/8 as desired.

Therefore:
- polynomials with key "2" -> constant -3/2
- facets -> two segments sharing vertex (1,0) as above
- hp_params -> [((1,0), 1)]

I present these inputs in the required structure.
