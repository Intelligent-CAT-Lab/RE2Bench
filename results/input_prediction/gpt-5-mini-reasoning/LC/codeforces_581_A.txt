[THOUGHT]
The code reads a single line, splits into tokens, converts them to ints, sets a = first number, b = second number.
It prints min(x) first, then prints abs(a-b)//2 if abs(a-b) >= 2, otherwise prints 0.

Given output "1 0":
- The printed min(x) is 1, so at least one of the two numbers is 1 and neither is less than 1.
- The second printed value is 0, which happens when abs(a-b) < 2 (i.e., difference 0 or 1).

Combining these: the two numbers must be (1,1), (1,2), or (2,1). Any of these produce "1 0". Choose the simplest: "1 1".
