[THOUGHT]
1. The function immediately returns None if sys.platform != 'win32'. The provided output is null, which matches that early return.
2. Therefore any handle value would produce the same output on a non-Windows platform; the simplest is to use the default/None.
3. So set "handle" to null in the input structure.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "handle": null
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
