[THOUGHT]
The function appends its last element to the list and returns it.
The observed output is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
Therefore the input list before append must have been the same list without the final appended element: [-70, 20, 9, 1].
Confirm: calling f([-70, 20, 9, 1]) will append num[-1] (which is 1) producing [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1], matching the output.
