[THOUGHT]
The function returns a list comprehension filtering elements > 0 and preserving order. To produce the output [4, 5, 6], the input list must contain those numbers (in that order); it may also contain non-positive numbers that would be filtered out. The simplest satisfying input is exactly [4, 5, 6].
