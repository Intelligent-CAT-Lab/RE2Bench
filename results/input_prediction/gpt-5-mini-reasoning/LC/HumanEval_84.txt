[THOUGHT]
The function converts N to a string, sums its decimal digits, then returns the binary representation (without the '0b' prefix) of that sum.

The output "1100" is the binary for decimal 12. So the sum of the digits of N must be 12.

A simple N whose digits sum to 12 is 39 (3 + 9 = 12). For N = 39, sum = 12 -> bin(12) = '0b1100' -> return '1100'.
