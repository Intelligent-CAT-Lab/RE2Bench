[THOUGHT]
The load_image method does not return anything (no return statement), so its return value is None — matching the observed output null.

From the class __init__, self.image is initialized to None before calling load_image, so the input object's "image" field is None.

The image_path argument can be any string path; the output doesn't reveal which one was used. I'll provide a plausible example path such as "example.png".

Therefore:
- self.image: null
- args.image_path: "example.png"
- kwargs: {}
