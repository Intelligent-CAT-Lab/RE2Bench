[THOUGHT]
The method update_product_quantity returns None (no explicit return), which matches the observed output null. The method checks if product_id is in self.inventory; if so it increments self.inventory[product_id]['quantity'] by the given quantity.

To be consistent with the provided structure (inventory has a key "1"), choose product_id = "1" so the condition is true and the quantity will be updated. Pick a plausible product name like "Widget" and an initial quantity 10, and choose quantity to add as 5. After the call the stored quantity would become 15, but the function still returns None, matching the output.

So:
- self.inventory contains key "1" with name "Widget" and quantity 10
- product_id argument is "1"
- quantity argument is 5
- kwargs is empty
