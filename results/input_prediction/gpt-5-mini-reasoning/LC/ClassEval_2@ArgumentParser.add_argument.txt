The method add_argument returns None (no explicit return), so the observed output null gives no information about which branch ran. Any valid call is consistent.

I'll choose a simple, common call: adding a "name" argument with default arg_type str and required False. That will leave required empty and set types["name"] = str (which could already have been str). I'll represent the types as "str"/"int" in the JSON and the required set as an empty list (JSON-friendly).

So:
- self.required is an empty set -> [] in JSON
- self.types contains entries for "name" and "age": "name" -> "str", "age" -> "int"
- args: arg = "name"
- kwargs: required = false, arg_type = "str"

This call returns None, matching the given output.
