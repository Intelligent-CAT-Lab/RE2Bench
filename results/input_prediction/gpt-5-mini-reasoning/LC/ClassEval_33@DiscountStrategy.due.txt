We need to find inputs to DiscountStrategy.due() that produce output 139.5.

Looking at due():
- If promotion is None, discount = 0 and due() returns self.__total.
- If promotion is not None, discount = promotion(self) and due() returns self.__total - discount.

The simplest way to get 139.5 is to have promotion be None and set the stored total (__total) to 139.5. In that case due() returns 139.5 directly.

So set:
- promotion: None
- _DiscountStrategy__total: 139.5
- customer and cart can be any reasonable values; choose a typical customer and an empty cart.

This yields the observed output 139.5.
