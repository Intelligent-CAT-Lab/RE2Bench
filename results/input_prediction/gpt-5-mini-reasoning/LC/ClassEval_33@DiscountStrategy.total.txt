[THOUGHT]
The total() method sums item['quantity'] * item['price'] for each item in self.cart and returns that sum.

We need a cart whose items multiply and sum to 250.0. For example:
- Item 1: quantity 2, price 50.0 -> 2 * 50.0 = 100.0
- Item 2: quantity 3, price 50.0 -> 3 * 50.0 = 150.0
Total = 100.0 + 150.0 = 250.0

So choose self.customer with a name and fidelity (e.g., "Alice", 120), cart as above, and promotion as null.
