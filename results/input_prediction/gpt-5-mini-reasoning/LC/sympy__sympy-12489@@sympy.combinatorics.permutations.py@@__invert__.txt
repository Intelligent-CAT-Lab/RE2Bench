[THOUGHT]
The __invert__ method returns self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form)).
To produce a returned Permutation with "_array_form": null and "_size": 5, the simplest consistent input is:
- self._array_form is null so that _af_invert(self._array_form) yields null (or an argument that causes the new object to have _array_form null).
- self._size is 5 so the resulting object's _size is 5.

There are no args or kwargs for __invert__, so they stay empty.

Therefore the input "self" should have "_array_form": null and "_size": 5.
