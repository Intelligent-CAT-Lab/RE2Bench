[THOUGHT]
The function creates an empty dict d and then loops "for key in dic". If dic is empty, the loop body never executes and d (still {}) is returned. popitem(last=False) is never called, so no error occurs even though a plain dict wouldn't accept that keyword if called. Therefore dic must be an empty mapping ({}).
