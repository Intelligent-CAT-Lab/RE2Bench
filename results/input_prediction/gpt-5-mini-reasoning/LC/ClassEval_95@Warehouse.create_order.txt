We need create_order to return None (JSON null). Looking at the function, it explicitly returns False when there's not enough stock; otherwise it updates inventory, creates an order entry, and has no return statement — so it implicitly returns None. Therefore we must pick inputs so the if condition is true: self.get_product_quantity(product_id) >= quantity.

get_product_quantity checks if product_id is in self.inventory (dictionary key match matters), and returns the numeric quantity. The structure uses string keys "1" for inventory, so product_id should be the string "1" to match.

Choose inventory["1"]["quantity"] = 10 and request quantity 5 (10 >= 5) so the condition is satisfied. Set product name to "Widget". The existing orders entry can be left as some existing order (it won't prevent creating a new one). Use order_id "2" for the new order (so it doesn't overwrite the existing "1", though overwriting would also be valid).

With these values, create_order will update inventory quantity to 5, insert the new order into self.orders, and implicitly return None (null).
