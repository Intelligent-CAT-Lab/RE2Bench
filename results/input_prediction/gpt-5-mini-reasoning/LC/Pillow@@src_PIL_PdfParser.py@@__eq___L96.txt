[THOUGHT]
The __eq__ implementation returns the conjunction of three tests:
1) other.__class__ is self.__class__
2) other.object_id == self.object_id
3) other.generation == self.generation

To make the overall result False it's sufficient to make any one of these tests false. The simplest is to make the class identity check fail by giving other a different __class__ value than self.__class__. Therefore I'll set other.__class__ to a different class marker (e.g. "NotIndirectReference") and include object_id and generation fields (their values don't matter once the first check fails). The provided "self" is left empty as in the structure.
