[THOUGHT]
The method withdraw_resume simply calls self.resumes.remove(resume) and returns None (no explicit return). For the output to be null (i.e., the operation completed without raising an exception), the provided resume must be present in self.resumes. The simplest construction is to have self.resumes contain the same resume dictionary that is passed in args. job_listings can be any list (empty is fine). kwargs is empty.

So set self.resumes to a list containing a resume object (e.g., name "Alice", skills ["Python","SQL"], experience 5) and pass that same object as the resume argument. The remove call will find and remove it and the function will return None.
