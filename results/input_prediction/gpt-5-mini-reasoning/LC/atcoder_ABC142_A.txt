[THOUGHT]
The program reads an integer N and prints:
- 0.5 if N is even
- (N + 1) / N / 2 if N is odd

Since the output 0.5050505050505051 is greater than 0.5, N must be odd. Compute for odd N:
printed = 0.5 + 1/(2N)

Set 0.5 + 1/(2N) = 0.5050505050505051
=> 1/(2N) = 0.005050505050505051
=> 2N = 1 / 0.005050505050505051 = 198
=> N = 99

99 is odd, so it matches. The input string provided to input() should be "99".
