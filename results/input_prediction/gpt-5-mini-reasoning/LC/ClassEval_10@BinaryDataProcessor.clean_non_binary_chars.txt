[THOUGHT]
The BinaryDataProcessor.clean_non_binary_chars method:
- reads self.binary_string,
- filters out any characters not in '01' and assigns the result back to self.binary_string,
- does not have a return statement, so it returns None (null in JSON).

The observed output {"output": null} only tells us the method returned None, which is true for any initial self.binary_string. The exact original string cannot be uniquely determined from the output alone. I'll provide a plausible input that demonstrates the cleaning behavior: an initial binary_string containing some non-binary characters, e.g. "10a01b2". (After cleaning this would become "1001".)

So the input state when clean_non_binary_chars is called is self.binary_string = "10a01b2", with no args or kwargs.
