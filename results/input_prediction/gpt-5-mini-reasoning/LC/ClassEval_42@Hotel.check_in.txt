[THOUGHT]
We need check_in to produce None (null). The function returns False in two cases:
1) if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()
2) if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type] and room_number > self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]

To get None, we must avoid both returns. Given booked_rooms is {"single": {}}, choose room_type "single" so the first if is false. Also ensure name is NOT in booked_rooms["single"] (the dict is empty), so the second if is false and the function reaches the end without returning anything (i.e., returns None). room_number can be any integer (it won't be used since name isn't present).

I'll set self.name to "Grand Hotel", available_rooms single: 10, double: 5, booked_rooms single: {} (as required), and call check_in with room_type "single", room_number 2, name "Alice" (not present).
