[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single input string and prints input().replace(',', ' ').
To get the output "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" the replace must have turned commas into spaces.
Therefore the original input must have been "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc" (commas between the three tokens).
No other characters are modified, so this is the simplest matching input.
