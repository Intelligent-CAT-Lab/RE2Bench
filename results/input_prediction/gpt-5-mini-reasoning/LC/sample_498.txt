[THOUGHT]
The function inserts the single element `added` at position `idx` into the list `nums` (nums[idx:idx] = (added,)). Given the final list [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], the original list must be this final list with the inserted element removed at index `idx`; the inserted element equals the value at that index in the final list.

Choose idx = 5:
- final[5] is 3, so added = 3.
- Removing element at index 5 from the final list yields the original nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3].

Simulate: inserting 3 at index 5 in [2, 2, 3, 2, 3] (i.e., appending 3) gives [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], which matches the given output.
