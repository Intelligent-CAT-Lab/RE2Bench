[THOUGHT]
We need the function to return np.True_, which happens in the final branch where it returns the result of np.isclose(...), which is a numpy boolean (np.bool_) displayed as np.True_. So we must avoid the early returns:
- x must be finite (np.isfinite(x) True).
- x must not equal 0.0 (otherwise it would return Python True, not np.True_).
Thus use a finite, nonzero x such that lx = log(abs(x))/log(base) is exactly an integer. With the default base=10, x = 100.0 gives lx = 2.0, so np.isclose(2.0, 2.0) returns np.True_. Use rtol=None to take the branch that calls np.isclose without an explicit rtol. Therefore choose x = 100.0, base = 10, rtol = null.
