[THOUGHT]
The program computes:
ans = (N // (A + B)) * A + min(N % (A + B), A)

To get output 0 we need that expression to be 0. A simple way is to set A = 0 and ensure A + B != 0 (to avoid division/modulo by zero). If A = 0 then ans = 0 + min(rem, 0) = 0 regardless of N, as long as B != 0.

Choose small values: N = 0, A = 0, B = 1. Then A + B = 1, N // 1 = 0, rem = 0, so ans = 0.

Input line (N A B): "0 0 1"
