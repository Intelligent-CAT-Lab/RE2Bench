re.split inserts captured groups into the result. The output list has 4 elements: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].

That structure corresponds to a single match with two capturing groups and nothing before or after the match:
- segment before match = "" (empty)
- group1 captured = " abiguygusu "
- group2 captured = " kjgufwycs "
- segment after match = "" (empty)

So the pattern must contain two capturing groups that match those exact substrings, and the input text must be the full matched string (group1 + group2 concatenated). Concatenating the groups yields " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs " (note the two spaces between because each group includes surrounding spaces).

A suitable pattern is "( abiguygusu )( kjgufwycs )" and the text is " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs ".
