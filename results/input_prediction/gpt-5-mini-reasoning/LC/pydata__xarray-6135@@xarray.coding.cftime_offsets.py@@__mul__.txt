[THOUGHT]
The method returns type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month).
The observed output object has n = -1 and month = 2.

Therefore:
- self.month must be 2 (month is forwarded unchanged).
- other * self.n == -1.

other must not be a float (the method returns NotImplemented for floats), so other should be an int (or another non-float numeric type). The simplest integer solution is other = -1 and self.n = 1 (since -1 * 1 == -1). (Another valid solution would be other = 1 and self.n = -1, but choosing the natural default self.n = 1 is more likely.)

So pick self.n = 1, self.month = 2, other = -1.
