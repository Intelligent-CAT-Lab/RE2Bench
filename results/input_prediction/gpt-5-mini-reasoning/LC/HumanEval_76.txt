[THOUGHT]
We need an (x, n) such that is_simple_power(x, n) returns True.

The function logic:
- If n == 1, it returns x == 1.
- Otherwise, it starts with power = 1 and repeatedly multiplies by n until power >= x, then returns power == x.

Choose a simple case with n > 1 where x is a power of n.
For example, x = 8 and n = 2:
- n != 1, so proceed.
- power starts at 1.
- Loop: 1 < 8 -> power = 1*2 = 2
         2 < 8 -> power = 2*2 = 4
         4 < 8 -> power = 4*2 = 8
         8 < 8 is false, exit loop.
- Return power == x -> 8 == 8 -> True.

So (x=8, n=2) yields True.
