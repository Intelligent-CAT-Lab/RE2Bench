[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of integers into tuple ABC. It prints "YES" only if ABC.count(5) == 2 and sum(ABC) == 17. Therefore the input must contain exactly two 5s and the total of all numbers must be 17. The simplest/most likely case is three numbers: two 5s and one 7 (5 + 5 + 7 = 17). So the input line should be "5 5 7".
