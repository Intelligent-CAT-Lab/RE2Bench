[THOUGHT]
The function converts text to a list of characters. If to_remove is found among the characters it removes the first occurrence (the insert/remove with '?' is a no-op unless '?' appears earlier), otherwise it returns the original text unchanged.

To get the output "sjbrfqmw" the simplest input is to pass text exactly "sjbrfqmw" and a to_remove value that does not appear in that text (so the function returns the original unchanged). I'll pick to_remove = "x".
