[THOUGHT]
1. _consumes_sample_weight checks _routing_enabled(). The default of get_config().get("enable_metadata_routing", False) is False, so routing is disabled and the else branch runs.
2. In the else branch it calls has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight'), which returns True only if the estimator has a fit attribute and 'sample_weight' is a named parameter in signature(estimator.fit).
3. To produce output false, has_fit_parameter must return False. The simplest way is to pass an object that does not have a fit attribute at all.
4. Representing that in JSON, an empty object {} (a dict in Python) has no fit attribute, so has_fit_parameter({}, 'sample_weight') -> False, matching the observed output.
