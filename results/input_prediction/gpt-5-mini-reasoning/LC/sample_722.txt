[THOUGHT]
The function flips the case of each alphabetic character; non-letters remain the same (since .upper()/.lower() on punctuation yields the same char). To recover the input, swap the case of each letter in the output and keep non-letters unchanged.

Output: ",WpZpPPDL/"

Transform each character:
0: ',' -> ','
1: 'W' (upper) -> 'w'
2: 'p' (lower) -> 'P'
3: 'Z' (upper) -> 'z'
4: 'p' (lower) -> 'P'
5: 'P' (upper) -> 'p'
6: 'P' (upper) -> 'p'
7: 'D' (upper) -> 'd'
8: 'L' (upper) -> 'l'
9: '/' -> '/'

Reconstructed input string: ",wPzPppdl/"
