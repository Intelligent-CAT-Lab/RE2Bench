[THOUGHT]
1. The function builds three regexes and returns the concatenation of their findall results: charset_re.findall(content) + pragma_re.findall(content) + xml_re.findall(content).
2. To get output ["UTF-8"], exactly one of the regexes must find "UTF-8" and the others must find nothing.
3. The simplest match is the first regex (charset_re) which matches a meta tag with a charset attribute, e.g. <meta charset='UTF-8'>. This yields ["UTF-8"] and does not trigger pragma_re (looks for content=...;charset=...) nor xml_re (looks for an XML prolog at the start).
4. Therefore the content input can be "<meta charset='UTF-8'>", which will produce the required output.
