[THOUGHT]
The function filters the input string keeping only characters where str.isnumeric is True, then joins them in order. The output "123314" is the concatenation of the numeric characters in the input in that order: '1','2','3','3','1','4'. The simplest input that yields that is the string "123314" (other inputs with these digits interspersed with non-numeric characters would also work, but the minimal matching input is "123314").
