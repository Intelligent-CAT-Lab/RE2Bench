[THOUGHT]
The function copies the dict and then calls popitem(), which removes and returns the last inserted key/value pair (insertion order of the dict literal). The structure lists keys in order "l", "t", "x:", so popitem() will remove "x:" and the returned dict will contain the remaining keys "l" and "t" with their original values.

The output shows {"l": 1, "t": 2}, so the input must have had "l": 1 and "t": 2. The removed "x:" can have any value; I'll pick 3.
