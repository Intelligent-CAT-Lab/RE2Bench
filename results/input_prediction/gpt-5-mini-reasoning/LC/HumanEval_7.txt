[THOUGHT]
The function returns all strings that contain the given substring. The output is ["grunt", "prune"].

Both "grunt" and "prune" contain the substring "run" (they both have the contiguous sequence "run"). While other substrings like "ru" or "r" would also match, "run" is the most specific choice that explains both returned items.

I need an input list where only "grunt" and "prune" contain "run", and their order is preserved. A simple list satisfying that is ["apple", "grunt", "banana", "prune", "stone"] — only "grunt" and "prune" include "run", so the filtered result is ["grunt", "prune"].
