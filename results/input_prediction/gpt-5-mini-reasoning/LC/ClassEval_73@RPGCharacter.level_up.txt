[THOUGHT]
The method increases level by 1 and adds fixed amounts to hp, attack_power, and defense:
- level_after = level_before + 1 = 4 → level_before = 3
- hp_after = hp_before + 20 = 160 → hp_before = 140
- attack_power_after = attack_power_before + 5 = 35 → attack_power_before = 30
- defense_after = defense_before + 5 = 25 → defense_before = 20

exp is reset to 0 by level_up, but its prior value doesn't affect the returned tuple; I'll provide a plausible nonzero prior exp (e.g., 50). Name can be any string; I'll use "Hero".
