[THOUGHT]
The method is_alive returns self.hp > 0. The observed output true means hp must be a positive number. Other fields don't affect is_alive, so pick reasonable placeholder values consistent with the class (level default 1, exp initialized to 0). I'll choose a positive hp (e.g., 42) and fill in name and other stats.
