[THOUGHT]
The select method builds "SELECT {fields} FROM {table_name}" and appends " WHERE {condition}" if condition is not None, then adds a trailing semicolon.

Given output "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;":
- fields must have been None so it became '*'.
- table_name must be "table1".
- condition must be the string "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

Thus the input object has self.table_name = "table1", no positional args, and kwargs.condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".
