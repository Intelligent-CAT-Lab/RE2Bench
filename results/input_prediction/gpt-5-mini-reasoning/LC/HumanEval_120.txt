[THOUGHT]
The function sorts arr and returns the last k elements (or [] if k == 0).
The output is [-4, 4], so k must be 2 and the two largest elements of the sorted array must be [-4, 4] in that order.
This means the array must contain 4 and -4, with no element greater than 4, and -4 must be the second-largest element (all other elements, if any, must be <= -4).
The simplest such input is arr = [4, -4] and k = 2 (sorting yields [-4, 4], and the last 2 elements are [-4, 4]).
