[THOUGHT]
1. getmodetype(mode) returns ImageMode.getmode(mode).basetype.
2. We need the basetype to be "L".
3. The simplest mode string whose basetype is "L" is "L" itself (grayscale 8-bit). Modes like "LA" also have basetype "L", but "L" is minimal and direct.
4. Therefore set mode to "L". No kwargs needed and self is empty.
