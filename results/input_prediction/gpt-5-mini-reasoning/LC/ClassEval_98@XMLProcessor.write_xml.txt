[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that cause write_xml to return False. The method does:
- tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root)
- tree.write(file_name)
and returns False if any exception is raised.

If self.root is None (null), ElementTree may construct an empty tree but tree.write(...) will fail because there's no root element to serialize, raising an exception. That triggers the except and returns False.

So a plausible input is an XMLProcessor instance whose file_name is some string and whose root is null, and write_xml is called with some target file_name string. This will cause an exception and make the method return False.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "file_name": "input.xml",
        "root": null
    },
    "args": {
        "file_name": "output.xml"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
