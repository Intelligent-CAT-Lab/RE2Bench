[THOUGHT]
The function first sets extra_chars = chars and removes all occurrences of chars from text, then sets extra_chars = chars + chars (chars repeated twice) and removes those from the already-modified text.

So if I pick chars = "a" and an original text that is the desired output with some "a" characters added, the first pass will remove all "a" and produce the required result. For example, text = "azbzquiuqnmfkxa":

- First iteration: extra_chars = "a", text.replace("a", "") turns "azbzquiuqnmfkxa" into "zbzquiuqnmfkx".
- Second iteration: extra_chars = "aa", text.replace("aa", "") does nothing because there are no "a" characters left.

Thus the final returned value is "zbzquiuqnmfkx" as given.
