1. dup_l1_norm returns K.zero if f is empty; otherwise it returns K.sum(dup_abs(f, K)).
2. dup_abs(f, K) returns a list of K.abs(coeff) for each coeff in f — effectively the absolute values of the coefficients.
3. K.sum(...) calls Python's sum with start=K.zero, so the result is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.
4. The observed output is 3, so we need sum(abs(coeff) for coeff in f) == 3 and f must be non-empty.
5. The simplest choices: f = [1, 2] (abs values sum to 3) and K can be a minimal Domain-like object placeholder with zero = 0.
6. Therefore the predicted inputs are f = [1, 2] and K = {"zero": 0}.
