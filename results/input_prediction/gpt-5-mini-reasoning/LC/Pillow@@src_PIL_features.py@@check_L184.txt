[THOUGHT]
We need a feature string that makes check(...) return the boolean True.

The function logic:
- If feature is a key in modules -> check_module(feature) is called and returns True if the mapped module can be imported.
- Else if feature is a key in codecs -> check_codec(feature) is called and returns (codec + "_encoder") in dir(Image.core) (a boolean).
- Else if feature is a key in features -> check_feature(feature) is called and may return True/False/None depending on an attribute, but it may also return a non-boolean (e.g., a version string).
- Otherwise a warning is emitted and False is returned.

To get the boolean True reliably, the codecs branch is a good candidate because check_codec returns a boolean explicitly. A common codec key in Pillow is "jpeg", and the Image.core extension typically exposes "jpeg_encoder" when JPEG support is present. So:
- check("jpeg") -> feature in codecs -> check_codec("jpeg") -> checks "jpeg_encoder" in dir(Image.core) -> True (if JPEG support exists) -> check returns True.

Thus the input is feature = "jpeg".

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "feature": "jpeg"
    },
