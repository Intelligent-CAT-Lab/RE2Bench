[THOUGHT]
The function returns False for n < 2. It then tests divisibility for k in range(2, n-1). If no divisor is found it returns True.

For n = 2:
- n < 2 is False, so it proceeds.
- range(2, n-1) == range(2, 1) is empty, so the loop body never runs.
- The function reaches the final return True.

Therefore n = 2 produces output True.
