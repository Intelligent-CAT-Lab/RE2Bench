[THOUGHT]
We need integers x,y,a,b such that lcm = LCM(x,y) and the program prints count = floor(b/L) - floor((a-1)/L) = 57900.

Choose the simplest case L = 1 (x = 1, y = 1). Then the count becomes b - (a - 1) = b - a + 1. To make this equal 57900, pick a = 1 and b = 57900. So input "1 1 1 57900" yields LCM(1,1)=1 and output 57900.
