[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers A and B from one line, computes ans = A - 2 * B, then if ans < 0 sets ans = 0 and prints ans.

We need the printed value to be 0. That happens whenever A - 2*B <= 0.

A simple choice is A = 0, B = 0:
- A - 2*B = 0 - 0 = 0, which is not < 0, so ans remains 0 and the program prints 0.

Thus the input line "0 0" produces the output 0.
