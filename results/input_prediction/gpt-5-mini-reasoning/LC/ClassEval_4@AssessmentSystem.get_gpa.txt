The method get_gpa(name) returns the average of the numeric values in self.students[name]['courses'] if the student exists and has courses.

To produce output 75.0, the chosen student's course average must be 75.0. The simplest choice is to query "Bob" and give Bob a single course "Physics" with grade 75. Then sum = 75, len = 1, average = 75.0.

I'll fill the other students with plausible fields and course grades (they don't affect the result), and set args.name to "Bob".
