[THOUGHT]
The method returns super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial). To get output true both parts must be true:

- (not initial) is true when initial is falsy (e.g. None, False, "", 0).  
- super().use_required_attribute(initial) (the parent Widget implementation) typically returns True only when the widget is required and there is no initial value — i.e. when initial is None.

Choosing initial = None satisfies both: (not initial) is True and the parent implementation will treat "no initial" as True, producing the overall True.
