[THOUGHT]
The function returns the "depth" value extracted from parser.parse(...). The output is 1.0, so parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop) must have returned depth == 1.0.

I choose a minimal, plausible input:
- s: a simple math string like "x" (commonly used example text).
- filename_or_obj: any filename (e.g. "out.png") — savefig will be called but we don't need to simulate its internals for the returned depth.
- prop, dpi, format, color: left as None (null in JSON). The function itself calls parse with dpi=72 regardless of the passed dpi, so passing dpi=None is fine.

Thus the input fields are set to these simple values which are consistent with the function returning depth = 1.0.
