[THOUGHT]
The function starts with names = ['Pete', 'Linda', 'Angela'].
It extends that list with the provided values, then sorts the combined list alphabetically.

The final sorted output is ["Angela", "Dan", "Dusty", "Joe", "Linda", "Pete"].
This contains the original three names (Angela, Linda, Pete) plus three additional names: Dan, Dusty, Joe.

Therefore the values passed to f must be a list containing "Dan", "Dusty", and "Joe" (order doesn't matter because the list is sorted afterwards). I'll use ["Dan", "Dusty", "Joe"].
