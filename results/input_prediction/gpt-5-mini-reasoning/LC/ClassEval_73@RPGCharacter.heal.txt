[THOUGHT]
The heal method increases self.hp by 10 and then caps it at 100 if it exceeds 100:

- New hp = initial_hp + 10
- If new hp > 100, set hp = 100
- The method returns the resulting hp

We observed the output 100. That can occur if:
- initial_hp = 90  -> 90 + 10 = 100 (no cap needed)
- or initial_hp > 90 -> initial + 10 > 100 -> capped to 100

I'll choose a simple valid initial hp that results in 100 after healing, e.g. hp = 95 (95 + 10 = 105 -> capped to 100). Other fields can be plausible placeholders.
