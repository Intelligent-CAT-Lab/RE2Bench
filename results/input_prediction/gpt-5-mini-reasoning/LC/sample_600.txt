[THOUGHT]
The function maps each element of array to 'n' repeated that many times, collects those into just_ns, then appends each to final_output and returns final_output. The output is [] (empty list), which means final_output never received any items — i.e., the loop did not iterate. That happens only if just_ns is empty, which comes from array being empty. Therefore array must be [].
