[THOUGHT]
The method returns 1 on success (no exception raised). That means:
- open(file_name, 'w', newline='') succeeded (valid writable filename),
- csv.writer(...).writerows(data) succeeded (data is an iterable of row iterables).

So a plausible input is a standard list-of-rows structure and a normal filename. I'll provide data as a small list of rows, e.g. [["name","age"],["Alice","30"]], and file_name "output.csv". kwargs is empty and self is an empty object (as specified).
