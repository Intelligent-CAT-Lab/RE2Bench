[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single integer n. It sets i = 1 and j = n*n, then prints pairs "i j" while i < j, incrementing i and decrementing j each loop.

The first printed line is "1 64", so j initially must be 64, hence n*n = 64 => n = 8.

With n = 8, j starts at 64 and the loop prints:
1 64, 2 63, ..., up to 32 33. After printing "32 33", i becomes 33 and j becomes 32, so i < j is false and the loop stops. This exactly matches the provided output.

Therefore the input must be the string "8" (the integer 8).
