[THOUGHT]
The method does:
    arg = self.args[0]
    return arg.is_finite

So for the output to be true, the first argument (self.args[0]) must have an attribute is_finite that is True. I'll represent that by providing a self.nargs object that contains an args list whose first element has "is_finite": true. There are no positional or keyword arguments to the method itself, so top-level "args" is an empty list and "kwargs" is an empty dict.
