[THOUGHT]
We need to infer the inputs to Permutation.__pow__ that could produce a returned Permutation with attributes:
{
    "_array_form": null,
    "_size": 7
}

Looking at the method:
- __pow__ converts n via n = int(n). (They provided sympy Integer.__int__, so n could be a plain int or a SymPy Integer; either way it becomes a Python int.)
- It then calls self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n)).

To end up with a returned Permutation whose _array_form is null and _size is 7, the simplest explanation is:
- self.array_form is None (so _af_pow(None, n) would yield None or an array-form that results in _array_form being None).
- The permutation size attribute is 7 (so self._size should be 7).
- _cyclic_form is not constrained by the output; set it to null.
- n can be any integer; choose a simple integer (1).

Thus the input Permutation should have _array_form = null, _size = 7, _cyclic_form = null, and n = 1.
