[THOUGHT]
We need __lt__ to return False.

Code path:
- __lt__ first calls other = _sympify(other). With other a Python int (e.g. 1), _sympify(strict=True) will convert it to a SymPy Integer, whose is_Integer is True.
- If other.is_Integer is True, the method returns _sympify(self.p < other.p). Here self.p and other.p are the stored integer values; self.p < other.p is a Python bool. To get False, choose values where self.p < other.p is False, e.g., equal values (1 < 1 is False) or self greater than other.
- The simplest choice is self = Integer(1) and other = 1. Then other gets sympified to Integer(1), other.is_Integer is True, self.p < other.p evaluates as 1 < 1 -> False, and _sympify(False) yields False, matching the given output.

So the input is self = Integer(1) and other = 1; no kwargs.
