[THOUGHT]
The method delete_from_database:
- Takes self.database_name (string), table_name (string), and name (string).
- Connects to the SQLite database at self.database_name.
- Executes the SQL DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ? with name as parameter.
- Commits and closes the connection.
- Does not return anything (implicitly returns None), so the observed output null matches any valid input.

Because the function always returns None regardless of specific values, many inputs could produce this output. I'll choose common, sensible example values:
- database_name: "test.db"
- table_name: "users"
- name: "Alice"

These are valid and illustrate typical usage of the method.
