[THOUGHT]
The function returns an empty sequence. bf returns () (an empty tuple) in two situations:
1) invalid input: either planet1 or planet2 not in the known planet_names, or they are equal; or
2) valid adjacent planets (indices differ by 1), because the slice between them is empty.

I'll pick a valid adjacent pair to produce an empty result. Using planet1 = "Earth" (index 2) and planet2 = "Mars" (index 3):
- planet1 and planet2 are in planet_names and not equal, so the early return () for invalid input is not used.
- planet1_index = 2, planet2_index = 3. Since planet1_index < planet2_index, the function returns planet_names[3:3], which is an empty tuple (represented in the output as an empty sequence).

Thus the input should be planet1 "Earth" and planet2 "Mars".
