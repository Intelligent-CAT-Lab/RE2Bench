[THOUGHT]
We need an input array that makes f return an empty list.

The function:
- First, while -1 in array: array.pop(-3). If the array contained -1, this loop would run and pop from index -3 repeatedly; that risks IndexError unless the pops themselves remove all -1 values. To avoid that complexity, choose an input with no -1.
- Next, while 0 in array: array.pop(). This pops the last element repeatedly until there are no 0 values left. If we start with a single 0 (or any array containing at least one 0), popping from the end will remove elements until the array possibly becomes empty.
- Finally, while 1 in array: array.pop(0) removes from the front until no 1 remains.

A minimal safe choice is array = [0]:
- No -1 -> first loop skipped.
- 0 in array -> pop() removes last element (the 0), leaving [].
- Now 0 not in array, 1 not in array; function returns [].

So the input array [0] yields the given output [].
