[THOUGHT]
We need inputs y_true and probas_pred that produce the given precision, recall and thresholds from precision_recall_curve.

1. Observed returned thresholds (final) are [0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1. ], which come from the unique score values (after slicing/reversing). Internally thresholds are in descending order [1.0, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5] at indices corresponding to cumulative groups of sorted scores.

2. Precision returned is [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]. The first four ones are precision at the threshold points; the final 1 is appended by the function. Precision = tps / (tps + fps) being 1 means fps == 0 at each threshold index.

3. Recall returned (before the appended 0) is [1.0, 0.85714286, 0.57142857, 0.28571429]. These are ratios tps / P (P = total positives). The fractions correspond to 1, 6/7, 4/7, 2/7 — so P = 7 and reversed cumulative tps values are [7, 6, 4, 2]. Thus the internal tps array (in descending-score order) is [2, 4, 6, 7].

4. With sample_weight=None, fps = 1 + threshold_idxs - tps. Since fps==0, threshold_idxs = tps - 1 = [1, 3, 5, 6]. This implies total number of samples n = 7 (last index 6), and tps at each threshold indeed come from cumulative counts of positives when all labels are positive.

5. Therefore y_true (after sorting by score) must be all positives of length 7: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. probas_pred (after sorting descending) must have groups that change at indices 1,3,5,6, i.e. group sizes [2,2,2,1] with descending scores [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5]. Using these values (already in descending order) yields the observed thresholds, tps, fps and thus the reported precision/recall.

6. pos_label and sample_weight were not specified in the output; they should be null/None.

Thus the input is:
- y_true: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
- probas_pred: [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5]
- pos_label: null
- sample_weight: null
