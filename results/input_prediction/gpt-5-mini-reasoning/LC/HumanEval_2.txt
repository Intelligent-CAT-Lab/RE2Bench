[THOUGHT]
The function returns number % 1.0, i.e. the fractional part in [0.0, 1.0). The output 0.33000000000000007 can come from many inputs whose fractional part is that value (for example 0.33000000000000007, 1.33000000000000007, or -0.67, since -0.67 % 1.0 == 0.33000000000000007). I'll choose a simple input that demonstrates the modulo wrapping: number = -0.67, because -0.67 % 1.0 evaluates to 0.33000000000000007.
