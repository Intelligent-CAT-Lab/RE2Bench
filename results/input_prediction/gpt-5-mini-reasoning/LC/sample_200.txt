[THOUGHT]
The function prepends each character of text in order to value for len(text) iterations. That means the final result equals text[::-1] + original_value.

We are given final output "tm oajhouse". Split this into text[::-1] and original_value. A natural split is to take original_value = "house", leaving text[::-1] = "tm oaj". Reversing that gives text = "jao mt".

Verify: text[::-1] = "tm oaj"; concatenated with "house" yields "tm oajhouse", which matches the given output.
