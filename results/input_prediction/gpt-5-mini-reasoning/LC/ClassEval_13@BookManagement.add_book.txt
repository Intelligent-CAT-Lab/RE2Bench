[THOUGHT]
The add_book method has no return statement, so it always returns None (null in JSON) regardless of the input. Therefore the observed output null doesn't constrain the inputs. I'll pick a simple, consistent state: inventory has two books with counts 1 and 2, and the call adds a new title "book3". kwargs is empty as specified.
