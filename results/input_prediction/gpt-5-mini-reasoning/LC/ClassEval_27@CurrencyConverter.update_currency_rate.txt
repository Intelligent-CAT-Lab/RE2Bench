[THOUGHT]
The method update_currency_rate returns False if the given currency is not a key in self.rates; otherwise it assigns the new rate to that key and has no explicit return (thus returns None). The observed output is null (None), so the supplied currency must have been present in self.rates. I'll choose an existing key from the rates (e.g., "JPY") and provide an updated numeric rate (e.g., 111.0). The self.rates mapping will include the original default values for the known currencies and a value for "KRW" as required by the structure.
