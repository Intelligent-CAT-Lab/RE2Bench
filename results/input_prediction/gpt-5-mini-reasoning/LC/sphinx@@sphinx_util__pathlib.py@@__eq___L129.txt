[THOUGHT]
We need the input to _StrPath.__eq__ that leads to it returning False.

Look at the implementation:
- If other is a PurePath, it returns super().__eq__(other) — that can be False if the paths differ.
- If other is a str, it warns and returns self.__str__() == other.
- Otherwise it returns NotImplemented.

The observed output is the boolean false, so the method returned False (not NotImplemented). The simplest, most direct way to get False is to pass a string that does not equal self.__str__(). Then the second branch is taken (isinstance(other, str)), it warns and returns the string comparison result False.

Therefore choose other to be a string different from whatever self would stringify to (we don't need to specify self's internal value in this task). I'll set other to "/tmp/strpath" (any string different from self.__str__() would work), which makes the comparison return False.
