[THOUGHT]
We need s, n, c such that f(s, n, c) returns ".".

Function:
- width = len(c) * n
- loop runs width - len(s) times, each iteration does s = c + s
- final result is c repeated (width - len(s)) times, followed by original s (if loop count >= 0)

Simplest way: make the loop run 0 times so the function returns the original s unchanged. That requires width - len(s) == 0, i.e. len(c) * n == len(s).

If we pick s = "." (length 1), choose n = 1 and any c with length 1 (for simplicity c = "."). Then width = len(c) * n = 1 * 1 = 1, width - len(s) = 1 - 1 = 0, so loop does not run and the function returns s which is ".".

Thus:
- s = "."
- n = 1
- c = "."
