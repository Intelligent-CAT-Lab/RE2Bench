[THOUGHT]
The method uses re.match(pattern, text), which attempts to match the pattern at the start of the text. The output is false, so re.match returned None (no match at start).

A simple choice is pattern "a" and text "b": re.match("a", "b") returns None because the first character of "b" is not "a". Therefore the method returns False.
