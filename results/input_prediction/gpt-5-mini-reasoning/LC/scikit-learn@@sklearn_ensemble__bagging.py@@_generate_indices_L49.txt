[THOUGHT]
1. The function returns indices either from random_state.randint(...) when bootstrap is True, or from sample_without_replacement(...) when bootstrap is False.
2. The observed output is a single-element list [0]. The simplest deterministic way to get that is to call sample_without_replacement with n_population=1 and n_samples=1; that always returns [0] regardless of the random_state.
3. Therefore set bootstrap = false, n_population = 1, n_samples = 1, and random_state can be None (or any seed); I'll use null (None).
4. Fill the structure accordingly.
