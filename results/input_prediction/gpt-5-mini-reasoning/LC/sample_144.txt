[THOUGHT]
The function initializes sorted_vecs = [] and only appends inside the for vec in vectors loop. To get an empty list as the return value, the loop must not run at all. That happens when vectors is an empty iterable (e.g., []). The simplest input that produces the output [] is vectors = [].
