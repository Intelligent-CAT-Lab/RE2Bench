[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d and computes the maximum of the four pairwise products a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.

We need to produce four integers such that the maximum product equals 56183721947132200.

A simple choice is to make a*c equal to that target and make the other products smaller (e.g., zero). For example:
- a = 1
- b = 0
- c = 56183721947132200
- d = 0

Then the products are:
- a * c = 1 * 56183721947132200 = 56183721947132200
- a * d = 1 * 0 = 0
- b * c = 0 * 56183721947132200 = 0
- b * d = 0 * 0 = 0

The maximum of these is 56183721947132200, matching the given output. So the input string should be the four integers separated by spaces: "1 0 56183721947132200 0".
