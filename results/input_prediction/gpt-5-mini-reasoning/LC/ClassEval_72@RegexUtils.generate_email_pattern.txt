[THOUGHT]
The method generate_email_pattern(self) does not use any attributes or arguments; it simply returns a hard-coded pattern string. Therefore the input is just a call on a RegexUtils instance with no positional or keyword arguments. Representing the instance as an empty dict (no observable attributes) matches the required structure.
