[THOUGHT]
The function returns sorted(list(set(l))). The output is the sorted list [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]. That means set(l) must be {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}, so the input list must contain at least one occurrence of each of these values (it may contain duplicates and be in any order). I'll choose an input list that includes each required value and some duplicates to show the set operation, for example: [3, 0, 9, 2, 5, 123, 3, 5, 2]. Applying set() gives {0,2,3,5,9,123} and sorting yields [0,2,3,5,9,123], which matches the given output.
