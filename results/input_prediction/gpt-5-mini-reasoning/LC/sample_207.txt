The function f starts with d = {} and iterates over each dict c in commands, doing d.update(c). The final d must be {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}.

A simple way to produce that final mapping is to provide a list of dicts that set each key to its final value in order (no overwrites needed). For example:
- First update with {"brown": 2} -> d becomes {"brown": 2}
- Then update with {"blue": 5} -> d becomes {"brown": 2, "blue": 5}
- Then update with {"bright": 4} -> d becomes {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}

This yields the required output.
