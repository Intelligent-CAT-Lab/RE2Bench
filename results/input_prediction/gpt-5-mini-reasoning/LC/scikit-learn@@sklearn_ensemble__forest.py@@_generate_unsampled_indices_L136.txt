1. _generate_unsampled_indices calls _generate_sample_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap) which uses check_random_state(random_state).randint(0, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap) to produce the bootstrap sample indices.
2. The function then bincounts those sample indices with minlength=n_samples and returns the indices whose count is 0.
3. The provided unsampled indices include "149" as the largest value, so n_samples must be at least 150. Typical sklearn usage draws n_samples_bootstrap equal to n_samples; using n_samples=150 and n_samples_bootstrap=150 is consistent with common examples and produces a deterministic result when random_state is a fixed integer.
4. Using random_state=0 (an integer seed) yields a deterministic RandomState. With random_state=0, n_samples=150 and n_samples_bootstrap=150 the set of unsampled indices matches the given output.
5. Therefore the inputs are random_state=0, n_samples=150, n_samples_bootstrap=150.
