[THOUGHT]
We need an integer input that causes the program to print "NO".

The code:
- Reads n = int(input()).
- While n % 2 == 0: n /= 2 (note: /= produces a float).
- After the loop, if n == 1: print 'YES' else print 'NO'.

To get "NO", n must not end up equal to 1 after repeatedly dividing even factors of 2. The simplest choice is an odd integer not equal to 1 (e.g., 3). Execution with input "3":
- n = 3
- while 3 % 2 == 0? No (3 % 2 == 1), so skip loop.
- n == 1? No (3 != 1), so prints "NO".

Thus input "3" yields the observed output.
