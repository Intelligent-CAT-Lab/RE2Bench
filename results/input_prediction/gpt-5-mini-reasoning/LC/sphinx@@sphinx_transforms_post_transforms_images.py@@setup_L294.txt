[THOUGHT]
1. The setup function is called with a single argument `app`. Inside, it calls `app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader)` and `app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor)` and then returns the metadata dictionary shown in the output.
2. Therefore the input must provide an `app` object that has an `add_post_transform` method. For the purposes of this prediction we only need to represent the `app` argument in the input structure; a simple stub object is sufficient.
3. The structure requires "self" (unused) and "kwargs" empty. I'll supply "app" as a stub object (represented as an empty JSON object) to indicate the Sphinx application instance passed in.
