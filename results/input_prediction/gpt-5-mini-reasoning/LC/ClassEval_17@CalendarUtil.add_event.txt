[THOUGHT]
The add_event method simply appends the provided event to self.events and has no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null). Given the output is null, any valid event object could have been passed. A minimal, plausible input is an instance with an empty events list and a typical event dict (date and times as strings plus a description). I'll use a reasonable example event for the prediction.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "events": []
    },
    "args": {
        "event": {
            "date": "2025-12-24",
            "start_time": "09:00",
            "end_time": "10:00",
            "description": "Team meeting"
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
