[THOUGHT]
The parse function attempts to construct Version(version) and only falls back to LegacyVersion if Version(...) raises InvalidVersion. The observed output is "<Version('1.11.3')>", which indicates Version was successfully constructed with the string "1.11.3". Therefore the input version must be "1.11.3".
