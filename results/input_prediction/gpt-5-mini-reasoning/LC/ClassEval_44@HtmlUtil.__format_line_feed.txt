[THOUGHT]
The method applies re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text), which collapses any run of one or more newline characters into a single '\n'. The output "Some sentence here." contains no newline characters. The only way for the substitution to produce no newlines is that the input also contains no newline characters. Therefore the input text must be exactly "Some sentence here.".

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "text": "Some sentence here."
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
