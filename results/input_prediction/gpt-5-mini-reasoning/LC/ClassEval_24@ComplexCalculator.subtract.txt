[THOUGHT]
The method returns complex(real, imaginary) where real = c1.real - c2.real and imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag. The output is (2-2j), so we need:
  real = 2
  imaginary = -2

Choose simple complex operands:
  Let c1 = 3+1j and c2 = 1+3j
Then:
  real = 3 - 1 = 2
  imag = 1 - 3 = -2
This yields complex(2, -2) which prints as (2-2j).
