[THOUGHT]
The function implements the Euclidean algorithm: while b is nonzero it sets (a, b) = (b, a % b), then returns a.

We need gcd(a, b) == 5. Choose a = 10, b = 5:
- Loop check: b is 5 (truthy), so set a = 5, b = 10 % 5 = 0.
- Next loop: b is 0 (falsy), exit and return a, which is 5.

Thus (a=10, b=5) produces output 5.
