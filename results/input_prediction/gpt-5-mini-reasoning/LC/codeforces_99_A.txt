[THOUGHT]
Let the input be s. The code does:
- num = s.split('.') → num[0] is the part before the dot, num[1] after.
- First branch: if int(num[0][-1]) == 9 → last digit of integer part is 9; then it would print a string not equal to 2. So this must be false.
- Second branch: elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5 → looks at the first digit of the fractional part; if >=5, it prints int(num[0]) + 1.
- Else: prints num[0] as-is.

We need the program to print 2. Two ways:
- If second branch runs and int(num[0]) + 1 == 2 → int(num[0]) == 1. So num[0] = "1" and num[1] must start with a digit >= 5 (e.g., "5"). Example: "1.5" → splits to ["1","5"], first condition false, second true, prints 2.
- Alternatively, else branch could print num[0] = "2" if fractional first digit < 5; but the simpler and unambiguous input is "1.5".

Therefore the input is "1.5".
