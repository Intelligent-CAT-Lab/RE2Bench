[THOUGHT]
1. The code returns ('%s.%s' % (module_name, self.value.__qualname__), {'import %s' % self.value.__module__}) when:
   - self.value is not a bound method of a class (first if fails),
   - self.value.__name__ != '<lambda>',
   - self.value.__module__ is not None,
   - '<' not in self.value.__qualname__.

2. The observed output is:
   - "time.time" for the first element -> module_name == "time" and qualname == "time".
   - "{'import time'}" for the second element -> module == "time".

3. A natural candidate is the built-in function time.time: it has __module__ == "time" and __qualname__ == "time", it's not a lambda, and it's not a bound method. Passing that as self.value will produce the observed output.

4. Therefore set self.value to time.time. args and kwargs are empty as per structure.

(Representing the function reference as the string "time.time" in the JSON-like input to indicate the function object.)
