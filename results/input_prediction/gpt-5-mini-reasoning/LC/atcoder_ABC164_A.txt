[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers S and W from a single input line and prints 'unsafe' if S <= W, otherwise 'safe'. The observed output is "unsafe", so the condition S <= W must be true. A simple valid input that satisfies this is "5 5" (S = 5, W = 5), since 5 <= 5 is true and will produce "unsafe".
