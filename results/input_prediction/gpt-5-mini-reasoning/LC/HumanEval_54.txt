[THOUGHT]
The function returns True when set(s0) == set(s1), i.e., both strings contain exactly the same unique characters (order and multiplicity don't matter).

A simple valid choice is s0 = "abc" and s1 = "cab" because set("abc") == {"a","b","c"} and set("cab") == {"c","a","b"}, so they are equal. This satisfies the output True.
