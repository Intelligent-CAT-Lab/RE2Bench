[THOUGHT]
The function removes letters whose lowercase is in ['a','e','i','o','u'] and keeps all other characters (including newlines).

Given output:
"bcdf\nghjklm"

- The first line "bcdf" must come from an original first line that, after removing vowels, leaves b c d f in that order. A simple candidate is "abcdef": removing 'a' and 'e' yields "bcdf".
- The second line "ghjklm" must come from an original second line that, after removing vowels, leaves g h j k l m in that order. "ghijklm" removes 'i' and yields "ghjklm".

Combining lines with a newline gives the original input "abcdef\nghijklm", which when passed through remove_vowels produces the given output.
