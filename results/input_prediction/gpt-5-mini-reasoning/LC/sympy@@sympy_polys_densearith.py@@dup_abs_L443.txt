[THOUGHT]
The function returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f] and the observed output is [2], i.e. a single-element list with value 2.

Therefore f must be an iterable with exactly one coefficient c, and K.abs(c) must evaluate to 2. The simplest choice is c = -2 and K.abs performing absolute value (so K.abs(-2) == 2). I'll represent K as an object exposing an "abs" operation (the builtin absolute function).
