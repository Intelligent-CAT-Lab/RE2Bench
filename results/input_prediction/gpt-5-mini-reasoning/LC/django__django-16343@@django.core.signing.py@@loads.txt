[THOUGHT]
We need an input s such that loads(s) returns the Python object {"a": "dictionary"}.

Django's signing.loads expects a signed (or at least serialized) payload that unsign_object will deserialize with the JSONSerializer. The JSONSerializer.dumps({"a": "dictionary"}) is the JSON string '{"a":"dictionary"}' (no spaces). Django's signing uses base64 to encode that payload before signing; the base64 of b'{"a":"dictionary"}' is:
  eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9

Therefore a minimal, plausible input for s that represents the serialized object is the base64 payload "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9". When unsign_object processes this payload it will base64-decode and JSON-deserialize it back to {"a": "dictionary"}.

So I provide s = "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9".
