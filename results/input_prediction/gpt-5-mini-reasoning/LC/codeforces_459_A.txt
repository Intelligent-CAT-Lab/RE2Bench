[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers anti, b, c, d.

The final else branch prints: anti, d, c, b (this happens when anti != c, b != d, and l == m where l = |anti-c| and m = |b-d|).

We need printed output "3 8 7 4" to match anti, d, c, b:
- anti = 3
- d = 8
- c = 7
- b = 4

So the input tuple (anti, b, c, d) is (3, 4, 7, 8).

Check conditions:
- l = |3 - 7| = 4
- m = |4 - 8| = 4 => l == m
- anti != c (3 != 7) and b != d (4 != 8)

All conditions satisfied, so the program would output "3 8 7 4".
