[THOUGHT]
The function computes sum of i**2 for each i in lst that satisfies all:
- i > 0 (positive)
- i % 2 != 0 (odd)
- '.' not in str(i) (its string representation does not contain a decimal point)

To get output 0, the comprehension must produce no elements (since any included i > 0 would contribute a positive square). The simplest input is an empty list, which yields an empty comprehension and sum([]) == 0. Other inputs that would also work are lists with only non-positive numbers, only even numbers, only numbers containing a '.' in their string (e.g., floats), or combinations thereof — but the empty list is the minimal clear choice.

So set lst to [].
