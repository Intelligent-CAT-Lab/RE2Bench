[THOUGHT]
The method construct_stop_word_list does not use self, takes no arguments, and always returns the fixed list ['a', 'an', 'the']. Therefore the call is an instance method invocation with no args or kwargs. The exact instance value for self is irrelevant; represent it as an empty object in the given structure.
