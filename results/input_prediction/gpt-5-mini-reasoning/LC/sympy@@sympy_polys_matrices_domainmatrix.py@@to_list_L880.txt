[THOUGHT]
1. DomainMatrix.to_list simply calls self.rep.to_list() and returns its result.
2. The provided SDM.to_list implementation creates an m x n list filled with M.domain.zero, then iterates over M.items() (i.e., rows of the sparse dict-of-dicts) and assigns ddm[i][j] = e for each stored entry.
3. The desired output is a 2x2 list whose elements are the four Matrix(...) values. Therefore:
   - shape must be (2, 2) so SDM.to_list will create a 2x2 ddm.
   - rep must provide entries for rows 0 and 1 and columns 0 and 1, each mapped to the corresponding Matrix value. Since these positions are all provided, M.domain.zero will not be used.
4. For domain we only need to supply something with a "zero" attribute/value; it's not used here, so a simple zero (0) is fine.
5. Set rep as a dict-of-dicts with string keys "0" and "1" mapping to the Matrix string values exactly as in the output.

Thus the input fills the rep entries with the four matrix strings, shape as [2, 2], and domain.zero as 0.
