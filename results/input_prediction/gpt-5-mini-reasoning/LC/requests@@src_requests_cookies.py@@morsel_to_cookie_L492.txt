[THOUGHT]
We need an input morsel that allows morsel_to_cookie to run without raising, and the observed output is null. The function always returns the result of create_cookie(...), which is a cookielib.Cookie object. In the provided test harness JSON output, complex objects that aren't serializable are represented as null. So the goal is to supply a valid morsel that doesn't trigger exceptions in morsel_to_cookie.

Key checks in morsel_to_cookie:
- If morsel['max-age'] is truthy, it tries to convert it to int and add to time.time(). To avoid potential ValueError/TypeError, make 'max-age' falsy (e.g., empty string).
- Else if morsel['expires'] is truthy, it parses a strict time string. To avoid parsing errors, make 'expires' falsy (e.g., empty string).
- Other fields (comment, domain, path, secure, httponly, version) are passed through into create_cookie; use reasonable default/falsy values (empty domain, path "/", comment null, secure false, httponly false, version null).
- The structure includes "samesite" though the function doesn't use it; set it to null.

Using these safe defaults ensures create_cookie is called with sensible kwargs and returns a Cookie object (which the test harness serializes as null). So the input morsel fields are set accordingly.
