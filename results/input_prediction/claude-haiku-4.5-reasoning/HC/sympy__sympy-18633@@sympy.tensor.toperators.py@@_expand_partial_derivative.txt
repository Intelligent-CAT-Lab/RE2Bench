[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_expand_partial_derivative` method to understand what produces the given output where `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are all `null`.

Looking at the method:
```python
def _expand_partial_derivative(self):
    args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
    obj = self.func(*args)
    obj._indices = indices
    obj._free = free
    obj._dum = dum
    result = obj
    if not args[0].free_symbols:
        return S.Zero
    # ... additional processing
    return result
```

Key observations:
1. The method can return `S.Zero` (SymPy's zero singleton) when `not args[0].free_symbols` is true
2. `S.Zero` is a `Number` object, not a `TensExpr`, so it doesn't have `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` as instance attributes
3. When such an object is represented in JSON/output format, these undefined attributes would show as `null`

For the early return `return S.Zero` to execute, we need `args[0].free_symbols` to be empty, which happens when the first argument is a constant expression.

When `_contract_indices_for_derivative` processes a constant expression with no variables:
- The resulting `args[0]` would be a constant (like `0` or `S(0)`)  
- This has empty `free_symbols`
- The condition `not args[0].free_symbols` is True
- The method returns `S.Zero`

Therefore, the input `self` should be a PartialDerivative instance where the attributes are in a minimal/null state, representing the baseline case before full initialization. The returned `S.Zero` object doesn't have these tensor-specific attributes, so they appear as `null`.
