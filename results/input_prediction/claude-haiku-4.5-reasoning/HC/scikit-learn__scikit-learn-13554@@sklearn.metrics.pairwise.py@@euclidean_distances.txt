[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to understand what inputs would produce [[1.1649954]].

The output is a 2D array with shape (1, 1) containing a single distance value: 1.1649954.

For the output to have shape (1, 1), X and Y must each have shape (1, n_features) - one data point each.

The `euclidean_distances` function computes:
1. Calculates row norms: XX = row_norms(X, squared=True), YY = row_norms(Y, squared=True)
2. Computes: distances = -2 * X·Y^T + XX + YY
3. Applies: np.maximum(distances, 0)
4. Returns: sqrt(distances) if squared=False, else distances

Working backwards from output 1.1649954:

If `squared=False` (the default):
- Output = sqrt(squared_distance)
- 1.1649954 = sqrt(squared_distance)
- squared_distance ≈ 1.1649954² ≈ 1.3572

The simplest case is 1D features where the Euclidean distance equals the difference between two points:
- X = [[0.0]] (1 sample, 1 feature)
- Y = [[1.1649954]] (1 sample, 1 feature)

Verification:
- XX = row_norms([[0.0]], squared=True)[numpy.newaxis, :] = [[0.0]]
- YY = row_norms([[1.1649954]], squared=True)[:, numpy.newaxis] = [[1.3572...]]
- distances = -2 * (0.0 * 1.1649954) + 0.0 + 1.3572 = [[1.3572]]
- np.maximum keeps it as [[1.3572]]
- sqrt([[1.3572]]) ≈ [[1.1649954]] ✓

So the distance between point [0.0] and point [1.1649954] is exactly 1.1649954.
