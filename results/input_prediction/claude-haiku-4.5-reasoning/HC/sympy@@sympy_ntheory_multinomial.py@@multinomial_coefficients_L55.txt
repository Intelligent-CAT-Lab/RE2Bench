Looking at the output dictionary, I need to determine what values of m and n would produce these results.

1. **Analyzing the tuple structure**: All keys are tuples with exactly 4 elements. For `multinomial_coefficients(m, n)`, the returned dictionary keys are tuples with m elements, so m = 4.

2. **Analyzing the tuple sums**: Each tuple sums to 2:
   - (2, 0, 0, 0) → sum = 2
   - (1, 1, 0, 0) → sum = 2
   - (0, 2, 0, 0) → sum = 2
   - etc.
   
   In multinomial coefficients, the tuples represent ways to partition n items, so n = 2.

3. **Counting entries**: There are 10 entries in the output. The number of m-tuples that sum to n is C(m+n-1, n) = C(4+2-1, 2) = C(5, 2) = 10. ✓

4. **Verifying coefficients**: For multinomial coefficients, tuple (k₁, k₂, k₃, k₄) has coefficient n!/(k₁!k₂!k₃!k₄!):
   - (2, 0, 0, 0): 2!/(2!·0!·0!·0!) = 1 ✓
   - (1, 1, 0, 0): 2!/(1!·1!·0!·0!) = 2 ✓
   - (0, 2, 0, 0): 2!/(0!·2!·0!·0!) = 1 ✓
   - All values match!

5. **Tracing execution path**: With m=4, n=2:
   - `not m` → False
   - `m == 2` → False
   - `m >= 2*n and n > 1` → 4 ≥ 4 and 2 > 1 → True ✓
   
   This means the function uses `multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2)`, which is consistent with generating these coefficients.
