[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_partial_fit` method to determine what input would produce the output `"GaussianNB()"` (a string representation of a GaussianNB instance).

1. **Initial state**: The method receives a GaussianNB instance with default parameters (priors=None, var_smoothing=1e-09) and training data.

2. **First call check**: 
   - `_check_partial_fit_first_call(self, classes)` is called
   - Since this is the first call, `self.classes_` doesn't exist yet
   - If `classes=None`, the method raises ValueError: "classes must be passed on the first call to partial_fit"
   - Therefore, `classes` must be provided

3. **Data validation**:
   - `validate_data(self, X, y, reset=first_call)` validates the input data
   - Both X and y must be provided as valid arrays
   - They'll be converted to numpy arrays if needed

4. **Processing flow**:
   - Calculate epsilon based on variance
   - Initialize theta_, var_, class_count_, class_prior_ (since first_call=True)
   - Process each class and update statistics
   - Return `self`

5. **Minimal working example**:
   - Need at least one sample per class
   - Need to specify `classes` for first call
   - `_refit=False` (default behavior)
   - `sample_weight=None` (default behavior)
   - Simple example: 2 samples with 1 feature, 2 classes

6. **Output interpretation**:
   - The output `"GaussianNB()"` is the string representation of the returned self object
   - This indicates a successfully trained GaussianNB instance is returned

The minimal valid input would be:
- X: A 2D array with at least 1 sample and 1 feature (e.g., [[0.0], [1.0]])
- y: A 1D array of class labels matching X's samples (e.g., [0, 1])
- classes: An array of unique classes (e.g., [0, 1]) - required for first call
- _refit: False (don't refit)
- sample_weight: None (no sample weights)
- priors: None (default)
- var_smoothing: 1e-09 (default)
