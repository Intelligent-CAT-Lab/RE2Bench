Let me trace through the `__init_subclass__` method to understand what produces a `null` output.

```python
def __init_subclass__(cls):
    if not hasattr(cls.draw, '_supports_rasterization'):
        cls.draw = _prevent_rasterization(cls.draw)
    if not hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature'):
        return
    cls.set = lambda self, **kwargs: Artist.set(self, **kwargs)
    cls.set.__name__ = 'set'
    cls.set.__qualname__ = f'{cls.__qualname__}.set'
    cls._update_set_signature_and_docstring()
```

The output is `{"output": null}`, which means the function returns `None`.

The function returns `None` (early return) in this condition:
```python
if not hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature'):
    return
```

This means for the output to be `null`, the `cls.set` attribute must NOT have the `_autogenerated_signature` attribute.

The function is called when a subclass of `Artist` is created. For the early return to trigger, I need:
- A class where the `set` method/attribute does not have the `_autogenerated_signature` attribute

This would be true for a simple subclass that either:
1. Inherits a plain `set` method without the attribute
2. Defines its own `set` method without the attribute

In JSON representation:
- `cls` is a class object with methods
- `draw` and `set` are methods represented as objects with their attributes
- An empty object `{}` for a method means it exists but lacks the special attributes we're checking

For the output to be `null`, `set` must not have `_autogenerated_signature`, so it should be represented as an object without that attribute (i.e., an empty object `{}`).
