[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the code to understand what input would produce the given output.

The output is: `"RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1)"`

This is the string representation (repr) of an RFE object. From this, I can directly extract the RFE's parameters:

1. **From the output string, I can determine the RFE parameters:**
   - `estimator`: SVC(kernel='linear') - a Support Vector Classifier with linear kernel
   - `n_features_to_select`: 4 - explicitly shown
   - `step`: 0.1 - explicitly shown
   - `importance_getter`: 'auto' (default, not shown in repr)
   - `verbose`: 0 (default, not shown in repr)

2. **Understanding the `_fit` method execution:**
   - It receives X and y which are validated via `validate_data()`
   - The method expects X to have shape (n_samples, n_features) where n_features > n_features_to_select (so > 4)
   - It needs enough features for SVC to work and extract feature importances via `coef_`
   - Since step=0.1 (between 0 and 1), the code calculates: `step = int(max(1, 0.1 * n_features))`
   - The method iteratively eliminates features and returns self

3. **Determining X and y:**
   - Need at least 5+ features (to select 4 from them)
   - Need sufficient samples for SVC to fit
   - Binary classification labels are typical for SVC
   - The output doesn't specify exact data, so reasonable sample data works

4. **step_score parameter:**
   - It's optional with default None
   - The output doesn't show any step_* attributes, suggesting step_score was not used
   - Therefore: step_score = None
