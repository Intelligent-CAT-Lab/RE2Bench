[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `build_digest_header` function backwards from the output to determine the input.

From the output:
```
Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460", opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"
```

I can extract the following values that become attributes of the output:
- username = "user"
- realm = "me@kennethreitz.com" (from self.chal['realm'])
- nonce = "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899" (from self.chal['nonce'])
- uri = "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (the path from url)
- opaque = "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904" (from self.chal['opaque'])
- algorithm = "MD5" (from self.chal['algorithm'])
- qop = "auth" (from self.chal['qop'])
- nc = 00000001, which comes from `'%08x' % self.nonce_count`

Since nc = 00000001, the nonce_count must be 1 at that point.

Looking at the code:
```python
if nonce == self.last_nonce:
    self.nonce_count += 1
else:
    self.nonce_count = 1
```

For nonce_count to become 1, either:
1. They're not equal and it's set to 1 (likely on first call with last_nonce='')
2. They're equal and it was 0 before incrementing

The most logical scenario is the first call where last_nonce is empty string (initial value from __init__), and nonce_count is 0 (initial value). This results in nonce_count being set to 1.

The uri "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" tells us that the `url` parameter must have this path. A reasonable URL would be like "http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

For the method, the URL pattern "/digest-auth/auth/{user}/{password}" and the output suggest GET is the most common method for such test endpoints.

The password can be inferred from the URL format - it appears to be "pass" (matching user in "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass").

The `num_401_calls` attribute is not set in __init__, and while it's used in handle_401, it's not used in build_digest_header itself. I'll set it to 1 as a default value.

The `pos` attribute initializes to None and isn't used in build_digest_header.

The `stale` parameter in chal is optional in digest auth and doesn't appear to be used in this function, so I'll set it to null.
