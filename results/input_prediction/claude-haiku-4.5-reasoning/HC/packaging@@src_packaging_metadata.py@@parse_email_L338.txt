[THOUGHT]
To determine the input for `parse_email` that produces the output `({"download_url": "VaLuE"}, {})`, I need to trace through the function logic:

1. The output is a tuple with:
   - First element: `{"download_url": "VaLuE"}` - a dict with one key-value pair
   - Second element: `{}` - an empty unparsed dict

2. For the first dict to contain `"download_url": "VaLuE"`:
   - The email must have a header that, when lowercased, maps via `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` to `"download_url"`
   - The reasonable mapping would be: email header "Download-URL" (lowercased to "download-url") → maps to "download_url"
   - The value must be treated as a STRING_FIELD and stored as `raw[raw_name] = value[0]`

3. For the second dict (unparsed) to be empty:
   - No other headers should be present, OR any other headers should map to raw fields
   - The email body should be empty or not produce unparsed entries

4. Tracing the execution:
   - Parse email with header "Download-URL: VaLuE"
   - `name_with_case = "Download-URL"` → `name = "download-url"`
   - `headers = parsed.get_all("download-url") = ["VaLuE"]`
   - Since it's a simple string: `value = ["VaLuE"]`
   - `raw_name = _EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING.get("download-url") = "download_url"`
   - "download_url" must be in _STRING_FIELDS, so: `raw["download_url"] = "VaLuE"`
   - No payload or empty payload → unparsed remains empty

5. The minimal email input would be:
```
Download-URL: VaLuE

```

In Python string format: `"Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n"`
