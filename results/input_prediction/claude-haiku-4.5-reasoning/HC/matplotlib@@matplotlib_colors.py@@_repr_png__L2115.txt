[THOUGHT]
To work backward from the PNG output to the input for `_repr_png_`, I need to analyze what the method does and extract information from the output.

From the PNG metadata embedded in the output:
- Title: "BiCone BivarColormap" → `name` = "BiCone"
- PNG dimensions from IHDR chunk: 256x256 → `N` = 256, `M` = 256

Tracing through the `_repr_png_` method:
1. It checks if `_isinit` is False and calls `_init()` if not initialized
2. It accesses `self.lut` (property that depends on `_isinit` and `_lut`)
3. Gets a 256x256x4 array, ensures it's 256x256 in both dimensions
4. Converts to uint8 and saves as PNG with metadata

From the code structure, `_isinit` must be set appropriately. Since the actual `_init` in the class raises `NotImplementedError` but there's a working implementation shown in the functions, the instance must have been properly initialized through a concrete subclass.

The key information from the output:
- `name` = "BiCone" (from PNG title "BiCone BivarColormap")
- `N` = 256 (PNG width)
- `M` = 256 (PNG height)
- `_shape` = "square" (most common default, produces the square output shown)
- `_isinit` should be False initially so `_init()` is called during execution
- Other attributes use defaults from `__init__`

For `patch`: While not directly used in `_repr_png_`, it's needed for `_init()` if called. A BiCone typically uses a small template array that gets resampled to 256x256.
