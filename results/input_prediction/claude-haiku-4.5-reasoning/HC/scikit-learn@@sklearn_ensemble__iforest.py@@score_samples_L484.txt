Let me trace through the `score_samples` method backwards from the output to understand what input would produce `[-0.79370053, -0.79370053]`.

1. **Output interpretation:**
   - The output is an array of 2 identical values: [-0.79370053, -0.79370053]
   - This means `score_samples` was called with X containing 2 samples
   - Both scores are identical, suggesting both samples are treated identically by the model

2. **Understanding the scoring:**
   - `score_samples` returns `-self._compute_chunked_score_samples(X)`
   - So `_compute_chunked_score_samples` returns [0.79370053, 0.79370053]
   - In `_compute_score_samples`, the score formula is: `2 ** (-depths / denominator)`
   - Therefore: `2^(-depths/denominator) = 0.79370053`
   - Solving: `log2(0.79370053) ≈ -0.33333`, so `depths/denominator = 1/3`

3. **Why identical scores?**
   - Both samples produce exactly the same anomaly score
   - This occurs when both samples are identical or equivalent in feature space
   - Simplest case: X contains two identical samples

4. **Input X:**
   - X must be a 2D array with shape (2, n_features)
   - For identical samples, both rows should have identical values
   - A reasonable minimal example: [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]] (2 samples, 2 features)

5. **Model parameters:**
   - Default parameters for IsolationForest would be:
     - n_estimators: 100
     - max_samples: 'auto' (which means min(256, n_samples) = 2 for 2 samples)
     - max_features: 1.0 (default)
     - contamination: 'auto' (default)
   - After fitting on data: n_features_in_ = 2
   - _max_features = 2 (1.0 * number of features)
   - _max_samples = 2 (limited by sample count)

6. **Fitted attributes:**
   - estimators_: contains fitted isolation trees (can't be fully serialized to JSON)
   - Similarly for other internal structures like _decision_path_lengths, _average_path_length_per_tree, etc.
   - These are represented as empty collections in JSON format
