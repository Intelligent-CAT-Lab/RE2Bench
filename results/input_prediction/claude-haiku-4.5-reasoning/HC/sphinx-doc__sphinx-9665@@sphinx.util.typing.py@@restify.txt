Let me trace through the `restify` function to determine what input produces the output `:py:obj:`None``.

1. The function `restify` takes a parameter `cls` of type `Optional[Type]`.

2. Looking at the very first condition in the function:
```python
if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
    return ':py:obj:`None`'
```

3. The output we got is exactly `:py:obj:`None``, which matches the return value of this first condition.

4. This means the input `cls` must satisfy one of these conditions:
   - `cls is None` (i.e., cls is literally None)
   - `cls is NoneType` (i.e., cls is the NoneType, which is defined as `type(None)`)

5. The most straightforward and common input that would produce this output is `cls = None`.

6. No other code path in the function produces this exact string, so this must be the correct branch.

Therefore, the input is `cls = None`, which in JSON format is `null`.
