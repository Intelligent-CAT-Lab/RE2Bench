[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution to determine what input would produce the given output.

1. The `_setup` function starts with `new = copy(self)`, so the returned `new` will share the same attributes as the input `self` (unless explicitly modified).

2. Looking at the code's modifications:
   - Lines check if `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are None, and if so, calls `tick()` and `label()` 
   - Since the output shows `_tick_params` and `_label_params` as dicts with all nulls (not None), the input must already have these dicts (preventing the if conditions)
   - `_matplotlib_scale` is explicitly set by the function
   - `_pipeline` is set by the function (shown as line: `new._pipeline = [...]`)
   - `_spacer` is set by the function as a function object
   - `_legend` is only set if `prop.legend` is True, otherwise remains from input

3. Comparing with output:
   - `trans`: "log" (must be in input, unchanged)
   - `norm`: null (must be in input, unchanged)
   - `values`: null (must be in input, unchanged)
   - `_tick_params`: dict with all nulls (must be in input to avoid tick() call)
   - `_label_params`: dict with all nulls (must be in input to avoid label() call)
   - `_legend`: null (either wasn't set by function, or was null in input)

4. For `data`, I need to provide a Series structure. The code uses `data.name`, `data.min()`, `data.max()`, `data.dropna()`, `data.unique()`. A name of "x" is reasonable.

5. For `prop`, the variable field should be comparable to data's name, so "x" works.

6. The pandas Series internal fields (_mgr.axes, _mgr.blocks, etc.) should have minimal but valid values. Using null for complex structures is reasonable for this serialization.
