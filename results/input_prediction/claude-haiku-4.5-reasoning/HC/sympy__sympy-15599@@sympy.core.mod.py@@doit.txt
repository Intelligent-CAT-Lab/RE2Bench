Let me trace through the `doit` function to determine what inputs would produce an output of `"0"`.

The `doit` function has several paths that can return a result. I need to find what `(p, q)` values would make it return something that stringifies to `"0"`.

Looking at the early return conditions in `doit`:

1. `if q == S.Zero` - raises exception (not applicable)
2. `if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan)` - returns `nan` (not "0")
3. **`if p == S.Zero or p == q or p == -q or (p.is_integer and q == 1): return S.Zero`** ✓

The third condition is the most straightforward path to return `S.Zero`, which when converted to string becomes `"0"`.

This condition would be satisfied if:
- `p == S.Zero` (p is zero), OR
- `p == q` (both are the same), OR  
- `p == -q` (opposite signs, same magnitude), OR
- `p.is_integer and q == 1` (p is an integer and q is 1)

The simplest case is: `p = 0` and `q = 1`

When `doit(0, 1)` is called:
1. `q == S.Zero`? No
2. `p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or q is nan`? No
3. `p == S.Zero or ... or (p.is_integer and q == 1)`? YES
   - In SymPy, either `0 == S.Zero` is True, or if 0 is converted to SymPy Integer, `0.is_integer and 1 == 1` would be true
4. Returns `S.Zero`
5. `str(S.Zero)` = `"0"`

This matches the expected output.
