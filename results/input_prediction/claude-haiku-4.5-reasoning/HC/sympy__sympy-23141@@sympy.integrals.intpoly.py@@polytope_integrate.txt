Let me analyze the `polytope_integrate` function to determine what input produces the output `"1/8"`.

The output is `1/8`, which suggests:
1. If we integrate a constant 1 over a region, the result equals the area of that region
2. Therefore, the region must have area 1/8

Looking at the function flow:
- If `clockwise=True`, vertices are sorted (but default is False)
- If `poly` is a `Polygon`, hyperplane parameters are obtained
- If `max_degree is None` and `expr is not None`, it calls `main_integrate(expr, facets, hp_params)`
- If `expr is None` when `max_degree is None`, it raises TypeError

For a simple result of `1/8`:
- The most natural case is integrating the constant 1 over a triangular region with area 1/8
- A triangle with area 1/8 can be constructed with vertices at (0,0), (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2)
- Area calculation: A = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8 ✓

Parameters:
- `poly`: A Polygon with the three vertices above
- `expr`: The integer 1 (required; cannot be None)
- `clockwise`: False (default, no indication otherwise)

The integration of constant 1 over this triangle region yields exactly 1/8.
