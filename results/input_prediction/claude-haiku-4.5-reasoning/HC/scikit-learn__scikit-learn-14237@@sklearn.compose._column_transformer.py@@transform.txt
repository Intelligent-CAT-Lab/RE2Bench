[THOUGHT]

Looking at the `transform` method and the expected output, let me trace through the execution:

1. **Output Analysis**: The output is a 2D numpy array with shape (2, 4):
   ```
   [[ 1. nan  1.  0.]
    [-1.  0.  0.  1.]]
   ```

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - `transform(X)` is called on a fitted ColumnTransformer
   - It calls `_fit_transform(X, None, _transform_one, fitted=True)`
   - This applies each fitted transformer to its selected columns: `_transform_one(transformer, selected_columns, ...)`
   - Results are stacked horizontally via `_hstack(list(Xs))`

3. **Working Backwards from Output**:
   - The output has 4 columns, suggesting 4 transformers, each processing one column
   - The output has 2 rows, so input X must have 2 rows
   - The output values appear to match the input values directly, suggesting identity/passthrough transformers
   - For the value `nan` (NaN) to appear in output, it must be in the input

4. **State Requirements**:
   - `_n_features = 4` (fitted on 4 features)
   - `_columns = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]` (one column per transformer)
   - `_remainder = ('remainder', 'drop', None)` (no remaining columns)
   - `sparse_output_ = False` (output is dense)
   - `remainder = 'drop'` (standard)
   - `transformers_` contains the 4 fitted transformers for each column
   - `transformer_weights = None` (no weighting)

5. **Input X**:
   - Must be shape (2, 4) or larger (with remainder='drop')
   - First row: [1.0, nan, 1.0, 0.0, ...]
   - Second row: [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, ...]
   - In JSON, NaN is represented as `null`

6. **Transformers**:
   - Represented as empty dicts {} (placeholders for actual transformer objects)
   - Each processes one column with identity transformation
