Let me work through the function `orthogonal_mp_gram` step by step to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

**Output Analysis:**
- The output is: `[0, 2.33249979, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- This is a 1D array with 12 elements
- Only index 1 has a non-zero value of 2.33249979
- All other indices are 0

**Key Observations:**
1. The array has 12 elements, so `len(Gram)` must be 12
2. Since the output is 1D after `np.squeeze()`, and the function creates `coef = np.zeros((len(Gram), Xy.shape[1]))` when `return_path=False`, this means `Xy.shape[1] = 1` (single target)
3. Only one atom (at index 1) was selected by the algorithm
4. The coefficient for that atom is 2.33249979

**Tracing the Logic:**
- When `n_nonzero_coefs` and `tol` are both None: `n_nonzero_coefs = int(0.1 * 12) = 1`
- With `max_features = 1` (since tol is None), the algorithm stops after selecting 1 atom
- The `_gram_omp` function iteratively selects atoms based on maximum correlation with the residual
- For atom index 1 to be selected and have coefficient 2.33249979, the input Xy should have this value at index 1

**Simplest Configuration:**
Using a 12×12 identity Gram matrix and Xy vector with the target value at index 1:

1. Initially `alpha = Xy = [0, 2.33249979, 0, ...]`
2. `argmax(abs(alpha))` selects index 1
3. With identity Gram, the Cholesky factor L is identity
4. The solution `gamma = Xy[1] = 2.33249979`
5. The residual after one iteration becomes zero at the selected position
6. Algorithm terminates after 1 iteration (reaching n_active = max_features = 1)
7. Result: `coef[1, 0] = 2.33249979`, squeezed to the observed output

**Parameters:**
- `n_nonzero_coefs = None` → becomes 1
- `tol = None` → stops based on atom count
- `norms_squared = None` → not needed when tol is None
- `copy_Xy = False` → straightforward parameter
