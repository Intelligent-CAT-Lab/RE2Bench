[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the transform function to understand what input would produce the given output.

The transform function:
1. Validates that the imputer is fitted
2. Gets the statistics computed during fit
3. Creates a mask of missing values by comparing X with self.missing_values
4. Replaces missing values with statistics

Looking at the output, I notice several recurring imputed values:
- 5.80707965 (appears in rows 5, 25, 29 at column 0)
- 3.07211538 (appears in rows 3, 5, 24 at column 1)
- 3.75545455 (appears in rows 7, 13, 19, 26 at column 2)
- 1.19722222 (appears in rows 13, 16, 17, 20 at column 3)

These are the statistics (mean values) that were computed during fit. Any position with these imputed values must have had a missing value in the input.

Working backwards from the output, I can identify which positions in the input had missing values (null/NaN):
- Row 3: column 1 is imputed → input has null
- Row 5: columns 0 and 1 are imputed → input has nulls
- Row 7: column 2 is imputed → input has null
- Row 13: columns 2 and 3 are imputed → input has nulls
- Row 16: column 3 is imputed → input has null
- Row 17: column 3 is imputed → input has null
- Row 19: column 2 is imputed → input has null
- Row 20: column 3 is imputed → input has null
- Row 24: column 1 is imputed → input has null
- Row 25: column 0 is imputed → input has null
- Row 26: column 2 is imputed → input has null
- Row 29: column 0 is imputed → input has null

All other positions contain the exact values from the output (no imputation occurred).

For the configuration:
- missing_values should be np.nan (represented as "NaN")
- strategy is 'mean' (since values are being replaced with means)
- add_indicator is false (output is still 30x4, not extended)
- keep_empty_features is false
- statistics_ contains the means: [5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222]
- The imputer was previously fitted, so _fit_dtype and _fill_dtype are float64
