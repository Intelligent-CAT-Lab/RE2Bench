[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `_eval_expand_log` method to determine what input produces the output `"log(5)"`.

1. The method signature is: `_eval_expand_log(self, deep=True, **hints)`

2. Looking at the output `"log(5)"`, this is returned by the final line: `return self.func(arg)`
   where `self.func` is the `log` class itself.

3. For this to output `log(5)`, we need:
   - `self` is a `log` instance with `args[0] = 5`
   - `arg = self.args[0] = 5` (an Integer)
   - We must avoid early returns and reach the final `return self.func(arg)` statement

4. Tracing through the code path for `arg = 5`:
   - `len(self.args) == 1` (not 2), so we don't call `expand_log` at the start
   - `arg = 5` is an Integer, so we enter the `if arg.is_Integer:` block
   - `perfect_power(5)` returns `False` (5 is not a perfect power)
   - For `logarg` to remain `None` and not be returned, `factor` must be `False`
   - Since `logarg is None`, we don't return inside the if block
   - We don't enter any of the elif branches (Rational, Mul, Pow, Product)
   - We fall through to `return self.func(arg)` which returns `log(5)` ✓

5. Required parameters:
   - `deep = True` (default used, doesn't affect this code path)
   - `force = False` (default)
   - `factor = False` (critical - prevents factorization)
   - Other kwargs: The structure lists kwargs that would typically be used if `expand()` were called. Based on `expand_log()` function, the defaults are: `log=True`, `mul=False`, `power_base=False`, `power_exp=False`, `multinomial=False`, `basic=False`

6. For `self.nargs`: In SymPy, the `log` class has `nargs = (1, 2)` because the log function accepts 1 or 2 arguments (natural log or log with base).
