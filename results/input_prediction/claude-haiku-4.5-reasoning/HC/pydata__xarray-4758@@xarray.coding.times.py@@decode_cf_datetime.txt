Let me analyze the output and work backwards to determine the inputs for `decode_cf_datetime`.

The output shows 5 datetime values:
- 1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000
- 1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000
- 1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000
- 1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000
- 1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000

Key observations:
1. There are 5 values in the array
2. Each timestamp is exactly 1 hour apart
3. All have the same date (1681-05-27)
4. Each time has 0.5 seconds past the minute boundary (500000000 nanoseconds)
5. The times progress from 12:00 to 16:00 (5 hours total)

To produce these datetime outputs, I need to determine:

**For num_dates:**
- The values should be in time units that produce these outputs
- If using seconds as the unit:
  - 0.5 seconds → 12:00:00.500000000
  - 3600.5 seconds → 13:00:00.500000000 (1 hour + 0.5 sec)
  - 7200.5 seconds → 14:00:00.500000000 (2 hours + 0.5 sec)
  - 10800.5 seconds → 15:00:00.500000000 (3 hours + 0.5 sec)
  - 14400.5 seconds → 16:00:00.500000000 (4 hours + 0.5 sec)

**For units:**
- Format is "delta_units since reference_date"
- Reference date should be 1681-05-27T12:00:00 (since 0 offset gives us 12:00:00.500)
- Unit should be "seconds"
- Result: "seconds since 1681-05-27T12:00:00"

**For calendar:**
- The year 1681 is within the valid range for both pandas and numpy datetime64
- Standard calendar is appropriate
- Result: "standard"

**For use_cftime:**
- Not included in the structure, so should be left to default (None)
- The output is numpy.datetime64 (not cftime.datetime), which is consistent with use_cftime=None initially trying pandas

Tracing through the function with these inputs:
1. num_dates is converted to numpy array and flattened
2. _decode_datetime_with_pandas is called
3. _unpack_netcdf_time_units parses "seconds since 1681-05-27T12:00:00" → delta="seconds", ref_date="1681-05-27T12:00:00"
4. _netcdf_to_numpy_timeunit converts "seconds" → "s"
5. Creates pd.Timestamp for 1681-05-27T12:00:00
6. Converts num_dates to nanoseconds: [0.5 × 1e9, 3600.5 × 1e9, ...] = [500000000, 3600500000000, ...]
7. Adds timedeltas to reference timestamp, producing the expected datetime64 values
