[THOUGHT]
To find the input that produces `null` output, I need to trace through the `_eval_is_rational` method and identify what conditions would cause it to reach the end without hitting any explicit `return` statement (which implicitly returns `None`).

Let me trace through the method:

1. **First condition**: `if self.exp.is_integer and self.base.is_rational and ...:`
   - For this to be False (to continue), either `exp.is_integer` or `base.is_rational` should be falsy/None

2. **Second condition**: `if not p.is_Pow:` 
   - For this to be False (to continue), `p.is_Pow` must be `True`

3. **Third condition**: `if e.is_Rational and b.is_Rational:`
   - For this to be False, either `e.is_Rational` or `b.is_Rational` should be `None` or `False`

4. **Fourth condition**: `if e.is_integer:`
   - For this to be False (skipped), `e.is_integer` should be None/falsy

5. **Fifth condition**: `if b is S.Exp1:`
   - For this to be False, `b` should not be Euler's constant

The simplest case achieving None output is when `self` is a `Pow` object with **two symbolic variables** where properties are uncertain (None):

Consider `Pow(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are symbols with no specific assumptions:
- `self.exp = y` with `y.is_integer = None` → first condition is False
- `p = Pow(x, y)` with `p.is_Pow = True` → second condition returns False
- `e = y`, `b = x` with both having `is_Rational = None` → third condition is False  
- `y.is_integer = None` → fourth condition skipped
- `x is not S.Exp1` → fifth condition skipped
- Method ends without return → implicit `None` returned
