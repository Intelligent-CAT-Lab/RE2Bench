[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `as_string()` method to determine what inputs would produce the given output.

Looking at the output:
```
from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
    ]
```

The method constructs this by:

1. **Processing operations**: The for loop `for operation in self.migration.operations:` will iterate. Since there are no operations in the output, `self.migration.operations` must be an empty list `[]`.

2. **Processing dependencies**: Similarly, `for dependency in self.migration.dependencies:` iterates. The output shows empty dependencies, so `self.migration.dependencies` must be `[]`.

3. **Handling imports**: 
   - The code checks various imports and constructs `imports` set
   - Since `'from django.db import models'` is not explicitly mentioned, the else branch executes: `imports.add('from django.db import migrations')`
   - This produces the line `"from django.db import migrations\n"`

4. **Handling migration_imports**: The regex matching loop would find no matches for a simple case, so `migration_imports` remains empty (no manual porting comment is added).

5. **Checking replaces**: The condition `if self.migration.replaces:` is false, so `replaces_str` remains empty. Thus `self.migration.replaces` should be `null` or `[]`.

6. **Checking include_header**: Since there's no timestamp/version header in the output, `self.include_header` must be `False`.

7. **Checking initial**: No `initial = True` line appears in the output, so `self.migration.initial` must be `False`.

The template fills in all these values:
```python
MIGRATION_TEMPLATE % {
    'migration_header': '',
    'imports': 'from django.db import migrations\n',
    'replaces_str': '',
    'initial_str': '',
    'dependencies': '',
    'operations': ''
}
```

Additionally, the migration object needs to have `__module__` and `__doc__` as shown in the structure.
