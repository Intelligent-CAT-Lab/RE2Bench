[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the BlockMatrix.__new__ method to determine the input:

1. Looking at the output string representation:
```
Matrix([
    [Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]]), Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])],
    [Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]]), Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])]
])
```

This shows a 2x2 block matrix containing 4 individual matrices:
- Top row: 3x2 matrix and 3x3 matrix
- Bottom row: 2x2 matrix and 2x3 matrix

2. BlockMatrix.__new__ is called with the class and arguments. The signature is:
```python
def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
```

3. The method expects a single argument: a sequence of rows, where each row is a sequence of matrices. The code validates this with:
```python
rows = args[0] if args else []
if not isMat(rows):
    if rows and isMat(rows[0]):
        rows = [rows]  # wraps if needed
```

4. The argument structure needs:
   - cls: the BlockMatrix class
   - *args: a tuple containing one element (the rows structure)
   - **kwargs: empty dict

5. In JSON, the rows should be represented as a 2x2 nested list structure where each matrix is represented as a list of lists:
   - Row 1: [[[4,2],[2,3],[7,5]], [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]]
   - Row 2: [[[1,0],[0,1]], [[1,2,3],[3,5,4]]]

6. According to the provided structure format, the args object contains "cls" and "args" keys, where:
   - args.cls is the class identifier
   - args.args is a list representation of the *args tuple
