[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `sympify` function to determine what input produces the output `"2500/pi"` (a string representation of a SymPy expression).

The output `"2500/pi"` is a string representation of a SymPy mathematical expression. I need to find what input to `sympify` would return such an expression.

Looking at the function flow with parameter `a`:

1. First it checks various conditions: `__sympy__` attribute, `CantSympify`, converters, etc.
2. For a string input like `"2500/pi"`:
   - It's not an initial SymPy object
   - It's not CantSympify
   - Direct converters likely don't apply to strings
3. When `strict=False` (permissive mode):
   - It skips the strict error check
   - For string inputs, it eventually reaches the parsing section:
     ```python
     a = a.replace('\n', '')
     expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)
     ```
4. `parse_expr("2500/pi", ...)` would parse the string and return a SymPy expression representing 2500/π
5. This SymPy expression, when printed or converted to string, displays as `"2500/pi"`

If I trace with `strict=True`:
- After checking that it's a string, it would hit:
  ```python
  if strict:
      raise SympifyError(a)
  ```
- This would raise an error instead of returning the parsed expression

Therefore, `strict=False` is necessary for a string input like `"2500/pi"` to be successfully parsed and converted.

The most straightforward input is:
- `a = "2500/pi"` (a string representation of the expression)
- `strict = false` (permissive mode that allows string parsing)
