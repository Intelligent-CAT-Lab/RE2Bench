[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the execution of `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` to understand what inputs would produce the output `[false, false]`.

The method initializes:
- `seen_zero = False`
- `seen_infinite = False`

Then it loops through `self.args`:

For the output to be `[false, false]` (i.e., `(False, False)` as a tuple), the returned values of `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` must both remain `False` after the loop.

**Case 1: Empty args**
If `self.args` is empty, the for loop never executes, and the method immediately returns `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)` = `(False, False)`. This is the simplest case.

**Case 2: Args with is_zero=False and is_infinite=False**
If `self.args` contains arguments where all have:
- `a.is_zero = False` 
- `a.is_infinite = False`
- Neither `a.is_zero` nor `a.is_infinite` equals `None`

Then for each argument in the else branch:
- The condition `if seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None:` would be False (since `a.is_zero is None` is False)
- The condition `if seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None:` would be False (since `a.is_infinite is None` is False)
- No values would be modified, leaving both as `False`

The simplest representation is **Case 1**: a `Mul` object with no arguments (empty `_args`).

Since the method accesses `self.args` which returns `self._args`, I need to represent the `Mul` object with `_args = []`.
