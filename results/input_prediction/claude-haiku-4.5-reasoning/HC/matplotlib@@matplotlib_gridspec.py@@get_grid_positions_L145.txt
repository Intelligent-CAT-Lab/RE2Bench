[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the input.

The output is:
```
{
    "output": [
        "[0.1]",
        "[0.9]",
        "[0.125]",
        "[0.9]"
    ]
}
```

The `get_grid_positions` function returns:
```python
return (fig_bottoms, fig_tops, fig_lefts, fig_rights)
```

So:
- fig_bottoms = [0.1]
- fig_tops = [0.9]
- fig_lefts = [0.125]
- fig_rights = [0.9]

Working backwards through the code:

From `fig_tops, fig_bottoms = (top - cell_hs).reshape((-1, 2)).T`:
- Since reshape(-1, 2) with 2 elements gives shape (1, 2), after .T we get (2, 1)
- This means (top - cell_hs) = [0.9, 0.1]
- So top - cell_hs must be [0.9, 0.1], which means cell_hs = [0, 0.8] (cumsum pattern)
- Therefore: top = 0.9 and cell_h = 0.8

From `fig_lefts, fig_rights = (left + cell_ws).reshape((-1, 2)).T`:
- Similarly: left + cell_ws = [0.125, 0.9]
- So cell_ws = [0, 0.775] (cumsum pattern)
- Therefore: left = 0.125 and cell_w = 0.775

For cell_hs and cell_ws to have just one height/width cell:
- nrows = 1, ncols = 1

Since cell_h = tot_height and tot_height = top - bottom:
- 0.8 = 0.9 - bottom → bottom = 0.1

Since cell_w = tot_width and tot_width = right - left:
- 0.775 = right - 0.125 → right = 0.9

For nrows=1 and ncols=1 with default ratios:
- _row_height_ratios = [1]
- _col_width_ratios = [1]

For wspace and hspace: when nrows=1 and ncols=1, these don't affect the calculation (dividing by 1 + spacing*0 = 1). I'll use reasonable defaults of 0.2.

Verification: 
- cell_h = 0.8 / (1 + 0.2 * 0) = 0.8 ✓
- cell_w = 0.775 / (1 + 0.2 * 0) = 0.775 ✓
- cell_hs = cumsum([0, 0.8]) = [0, 0.8], top - cell_hs = [0.9, 0.1] → [[0.9], [0.1]] ✓
- cell_ws = cumsum([0, 0.775]) = [0, 0.775], left + cell_ws = [0.125, 0.9] → [[0.125], [0.9]] ✓
