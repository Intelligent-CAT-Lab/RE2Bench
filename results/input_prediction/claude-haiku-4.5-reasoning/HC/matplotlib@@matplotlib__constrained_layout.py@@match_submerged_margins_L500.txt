[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `match_submerged_margins` function to understand what input would produce an output of 2 axes.

1. The function starts by initializing `axsdone = []` and iterates through `fig.subfigs`. For 2 axes to be in the output, we likely need `fig.subfigs` to be empty or not contribute additional axes.

2. The main filtering happens here:
   ```python
   axs = [a for a in fig.get_axes() 
          if (a.get_subplotspec() is not None and 
              a.get_in_layout() and a not in axsdone)]
   ```
   To get 2 axes in the output, we need the figure to have at least 2 axes that satisfy:
   - Have a subplotspec (are part of a gridspec layout)
   - Are in layout (get_in_layout() returns True)
   - Not in axsdone (typically satisfied if no subfigures)

3. The code then filters axes by checking if their gridspec is in layoutgrids:
   ```python
   if ss1.get_gridspec() not in layoutgrids:
       axs.remove(ax1)
   ```
   For both axes to remain, their gridspecs must be keys in the `layoutgrids` dictionary.

4. The remaining code operates on the axes but doesn't remove more axes, just modifies the margin values.

5. The function returns `axs`.

For the output to be `["<Axes: >", "<Axes: >"]` (2 axes):
- `fig` should have 2 axes in a GridSpec(1, 2) layout (1 row, 2 columns)
- Both axes should have subplotspecs and be in_layout = True
- The GridSpec(1, 2) should be a key in layoutgrids dictionary
- layoutgrids values should be layout grid objects with margin_vals dictionaries

Given the structure keys like "GridSpec(1, 2)", "Figure(1000x500)", I infer:
- layoutgrids is a dictionary mapping gridspec/figure objects to layout grid objects
- Layout grid objects have margin_vals with keys: 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', 'leftcb', 'rightcb', 'topcb', 'bottomcb'
- Each margin value is an array/list that can be indexed
