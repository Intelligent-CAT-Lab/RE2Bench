[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `predict` method step by step:

1. **Output Analysis**: The output contains 100 float values in a 1D array. This tells us that:
   - X must have 100 samples (rows)
   - The final output after all transformations is 1D

2. **Code Flow**:
   - `check_is_fitted(self)` - checks that the regressor_ and transformer_ are fitted
   - `self.regressor_.predict(X)` produces intermediate predictions
   - If `pred.ndim == 1` (1D array of 100 values), it gets reshaped to (-1, 1) → (100, 1)
   - `self.transformer_.inverse_transform()` transforms the predictions back
   - The squeeze logic: `if self._training_dim == 1 and pred_trans.ndim == 2 and (pred_trans.shape[1] == 1)`, then squeeze to 1D

3. **Determining _training_dim**: Since the final output is 1D (100 values as a 1D array), and the code squeezes from 2D→1D only when `_training_dim == 1`, we know `_training_dim` must be 1.

4. **Determining X shape**: With 100 output values, and an N-dimensional regressor that produces one prediction per sample, X must have 100 rows. A simple choice is a 2D array of shape (100, 1).

5. **Model attributes**: 
   - `transformer_` and `regressor_` must be fitted model instances
   - Other parameters like `regressor`, `transformer`, `func`, `inverse_func` would be the base (unfitted) versions used during initialization
   - `check_inverse` is typically True or False (default True)

6. **X values**: Since different X values would produce different predictions (depending on model coefficients), but we just need the right shape and structure, I'll use a simple incrementing pattern [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ..., 99.0] for each sample.
