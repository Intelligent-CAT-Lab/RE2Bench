[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the execution of `add_repr`:

1. `add_repr(self, ns)` is called and immediately returns `self` at the end
2. The output shows: `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`
3. This is the string representation of the returned `self` object, specifically showing that the `_ClassBuilder` instance has a `_cls` attribute with a class named "Concrete"

Since `add_repr` simply returns `self` (after modifying it internally with script snippets), the output is the repr of the input `self` object. The format `<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>` indicates:
- The returned object is a `_ClassBuilder` instance
- It has a `_cls` attribute that is a class with `__name__` = "Concrete"

For the `ns` parameter: It's passed to `_make_repr_script` but doesn't affect what's returned from `add_repr` (which is just `self`). So it can be any value.

For `self`: It needs to be a `_ClassBuilder` instance with:
- `_cls` set to a class named "Concrete"
- All other `__slots__` attributes initialized (since `_ClassBuilder` uses `__slots__`)
