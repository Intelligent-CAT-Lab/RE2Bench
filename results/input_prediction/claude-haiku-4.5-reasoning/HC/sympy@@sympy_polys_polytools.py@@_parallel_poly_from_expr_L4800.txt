[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` to determine what inputs would produce the given output.

The output shows:
- Two Poly objects: `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` and `Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`
- An options dict with: `gens=['cos(phi)']`, `domain='ZZ'`, `polys=false`

Key observations:

1. **polys=false**: The code sets `opt.polys = bool(_polys)` where `_polys` collects indices of Poly objects in the input. Since `polys=false`, `_polys` must be empty, meaning the input expressions are NOT already Poly objects. This rules out the early return path that sets `opt.polys = True`.

2. **Generator identification**: Both output Poly objects have `cos(phi)` as a generator. This is identified by `_parallel_dict_from_expr`, which extracts symbols from the expressions.

3. **Working backwards from the Poly objects**:
   - `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` represents a constant polynomial: the expression `2` where `cos(phi)` is a formal variable
   - `Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` represents `-2*cos(phi)` where `cos(phi)` is a formal variable

4. **Monomial dictionaries**: These would be created from the expressions:
   - Expression `2` → dictionary `{(0,): 2}` (constant term: power 0 of cos(phi))
   - Expression `-2*cos(phi)` → dictionary `{(1,): -2}` (linear term: power 1 of cos(phi))

5. **Domain construction**: The coefficients are `[2, -2]`, which are integers, so `construct_domain` would determine the domain as `ZZ`.

6. **Input expressions**: The simplest expressions that would produce these outputs are:
   - First: the number `2`
   - Second: the expression `-2*cos(phi)`

Both can be sympified into SymPy objects. Since this is JSON, the number `2` stays as a JSON number, and the expression `-2*cos(phi)` is a JSON string that will be parsed by `sympify`.

For the `opt` parameter, it should be an empty dictionary (or at least not specify `gens` or `domain`, which are determined by the function).
