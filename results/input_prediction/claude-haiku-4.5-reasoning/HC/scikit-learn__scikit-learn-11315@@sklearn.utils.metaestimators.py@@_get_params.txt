[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_get_params` to understand what input would produce the given output.

Looking at the method:
```python
def _get_params(self, attr, deep=True):
    out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)
    if not deep:
        return out
    estimators = getattr(self, attr)
    out.update(estimators)
    for name, estimator in estimators:
        if hasattr(estimator, 'get_params'):
            for key, value in six.iteritems(estimator.get_params(deep=True)):
                out['%s__%s' % (name, key)] = value
    return out
```

The output is:
```
{
    "n_jobs": 1,
    "remainder": "passthrough",
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "transformers": null
}
```

This output contains exactly the four constructor parameters in alphabetical order. This is the exact result returned by `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=False)` when:
- n_jobs = 1
- remainder = "passthrough"  
- transformer_weights = None
- transformers = None

Key observation: If `deep=False`, the method returns early:
```python
if not deep:
    return out
```

This means it skips the rest of the code (getattr, out.update, the loop) and returns the result of `super().get_params(deep=False)` directly.

If `deep=True` instead, we'd continue to:
```python
estimators = getattr(self, attr)
out.update(estimators)  # Would fail if transformers is None
```

So `deep` must be `False` to avoid errors and return the observed output.

The `attr` parameter is not used when `deep=False`, but should still be a reasonable value like `'transformers'`.

For the self object attributes, they need to match what `get_params` returns:
- transformers = null
- remainder = "passthrough" 
- n_jobs = 1
- transformer_weights = null

The _remainder and transformers_ attributes are not in the output (they're likely fitted attributes set later), so they can be null.
