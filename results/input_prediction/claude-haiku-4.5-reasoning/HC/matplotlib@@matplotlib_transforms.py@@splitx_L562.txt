[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `splitx` function with the given output.

The function does:
```python
def splitx(self, *args):
    xf = [0, *args, 1]
    x0, y0, x1, y1 = self.extents
    w = x1 - x0
    return [Bbox(...) for xf0, xf1 in itertools.pairwise(xf)]
```

From the output, we have 3 bboxes, which means `itertools.pairwise(xf)` produces 3 pairs.
Since pairwise needs 4 elements to produce 3 pairs: xf has 4 elements.
Since `xf = [0, *args, 1]`, args must contain 2 elements.

Looking at the output bboxes:
- Bbox 1: [[0.125, 0.1], [0.78375, 0.9]]
- Bbox 2: [[0.78375, 0.1], [0.78375, 0.9]]  
- Bbox 3: [[0.78375, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]

These represent [x0_local, y0_local, x1_local, y1_local] for each section.

The original bbox extents (from `self.extents`) must be:
- x0 = 0.125 (leftmost point from Bbox 1)
- y0 = 0.1 (bottom, common to all)
- x1 = 0.9 (rightmost point from Bbox 3)
- y1 = 0.9 (top, common to all)

Therefore: w = x1 - x0 = 0.9 - 0.125 = 0.775

Now, each bbox is created as: `Bbox([[x0 + xf0 * w, y0], [x0 + xf1 * w, y1]])`

The three pairs from `pairwise(xf)` give us:
- Pair 1 (xf0, xf1): 0.125 + 0*0.775 = 0.125, and 0.125 + xf1*0.775 = 0.78375
  - So xf1 * 0.775 = 0.65875, thus xf1 = 0.85

- Pair 2 (xf0, xf1): 0.125 + xf2*0.775 = 0.78375 (same as before)
  - So xf2 = 0.85

- Pair 3 (xf0, xf1): 0.125 + 0.85*0.775 = 0.78375 and 0.125 + 1*0.775 = 0.9 ✓

Therefore: xf = [0, 0.85, 0.85, 1]
This means: args = (0.85, 0.85)

For `self.get_points()`, since `extents` returns `get_points().flatten()` and should equal [0.125, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]:
- get_points() should return [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]
- So _points = [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]

For other attributes of the Bbox (from TransformNode):
- _parents: {} (no parent transforms)
- _invalid: false (bbox is valid)
- _shorthand_name: "" (default for regular instances)
- _minpos: null (not typically set)
- _ignore: false (default)
- _points_orig: [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]] (same as _points, no transformations applied)
