[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `get_metadata_routing` method to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

The output is a string representation of a MetadataRouter with a key 'consumesmetadata', which appears to be the name of a pipeline step. The routing info shows:
```
'mapping': [{'caller': 'fit', 'callee': 'fit'}, {'caller': 'fit', 'callee': 'transform'}, ...]
'router': {'fit': {'metadata': True}, 'predict': {'metadata': True}}
```

Analyzing the code flow:

1. `self._iter(with_final=False, filter_passthrough=True)` iterates through all steps except the final one, skipping None and 'passthrough' transformers

2. The final step is accessed: `final_name, final_est = self.steps[-1]`

3. If `final_est is None or final_est == 'passthrough'`, the method returns early. Since 'consumesmetadata' appears in the output, the final_est must be a real object.

4. The method checks `hasattr(final_est, 'fit_transform')`. Looking at the mappings in the output:
   - `{'caller': 'fit', 'callee': 'fit'}` 
   - `{'caller': 'fit', 'callee': 'transform'}`
   
   These match the `else` block (when fit_transform is NOT present), not the `if` block

5. Then additional mappings are added for predict, fit_predict, predict_proba, etc., which all appear in the output.

6. The final step is added to the router with `router.add(method_mapping=method_mapping, **{final_name: final_est})`

Given that only 'consumesmetadata' appears in the output, and considering filter_passthrough behavior:
- The simplest case is a single-step pipeline with just the final step
- Alternatively, there could be intermediate steps that are None or 'passthrough' (filtered out)

The minimal input would be:
- steps: A list containing at least one tuple with ('consumesmetadata', estimator)
- The estimator should not have fit_transform (based on the mapping type in output)
- Other parameters use their defaults
