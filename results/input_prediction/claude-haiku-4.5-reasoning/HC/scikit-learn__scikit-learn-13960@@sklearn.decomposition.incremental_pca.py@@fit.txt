Let me trace through the code execution and work backwards from the output:

1. **Determining the shape of X:**
   - The output shows `n_samples_seen_` = 150, meaning 150 total samples were processed
   - The output shows `mean_` = [5.84333333 3.05733333 3.758 1.19933333] (4 elements)
   - And `var_` = [0.68112222 0.18871289 3.09550267 0.57713289] (4 elements)
   - Therefore, X must have shape (150, 4)

2. **Determining batch_size:**
   - The output shows `batch_size_` = 50
   - In `fit`, if `batch_size` is None, then `batch_size_ = 5 * n_features = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - Since output shows 50, not 20, the input `batch_size` must have been explicitly set to 50

3. **Determining self attributes:**
   - The output shows these exact values:
     - `n_components` = 2
     - `whiten` = false
     - `copy` = true
     - `batch_size` = 50
   - These must have been the initialization parameters

4. **Identifying the dataset:**
   - The mean and variance statistics exactly match the Iris dataset:
     - Mean ≈ [5.84, 3.06, 3.76, 1.20] → sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
     - This dataset has exactly 150 samples with 4 features
   
5. **Verifying batch processing:**
   - With 150 samples and batch_size=50:
     - Batch 1: samples 0-49
     - Batch 2: samples 50-99
     - Batch 3: samples 100-149
     - This aligns with processing all 150 samples

Therefore, X should be the Iris dataset (150 samples × 4 features), which when processed with n_components=2, batch_size=50, copy=True, and whiten=False produces exactly the statistics shown in the output.
