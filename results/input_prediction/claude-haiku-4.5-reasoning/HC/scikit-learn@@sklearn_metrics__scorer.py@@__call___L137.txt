[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__call__` method to determine what inputs would produce the output `{"score": -Infinity}`.

1. The output is `{"score": -Infinity}`, which means:
   - There is one entry in the scores dictionary with key "score"
   - The score value is negative infinity

2. Looking at the code flow in `__call__`:
   - `scores = {}` is initialized
   - The method iterates through `self._scorers.items()`
   - For each scorer `name, scorer`, it attempts to compute a score
   - If no exception occurs, it stores the result: `scores[name] = score`
   - Returns the scores dict

3. For the output `{"score": -Infinity}`:
   - `self._scorers` must contain exactly one entry with key "score"
   - The scorer must be callable and return `float('-inf')` when invoked

4. Analyzing the scorer call:
   - The code checks `if isinstance(scorer, _BaseScorer)`
   - If not (which is simpler), it executes: `score = scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)`
   - This calls the scorer as a function/callable
   - The routed_params comes from either routing or from `Bunch(**{name: Bunch(score=common_kwargs.copy()) for name in self._scorers})`
   - With empty kwargs, this results in `routed_params["score"].score == {}`

5. For the input parameters:
   - `_scorers["score"]`: must be a callable object that returns `-Infinity`. We represent this as a placeholder object `{}`.
   - `_raise_exc`: can be `true` since no exception occurs (the scorer successfully returns a value)
   - `estimator`: can be any value; we use `null` as a simple placeholder
   - `args`: the `*args` parameter should be an empty list `[]` since no additional positional arguments are needed
   - `kwargs`: Already specified as `{}`

6. Verification:
   - With one scorer, `_use_cache` returns False, so cache=None
   - Iterating through scorers finds "score" -> calls the scorer -> gets `-Infinity`
   - Result: `scores = {"score": -Infinity}` → matches output ✓
