[THOUGHT]
The `delete_from_database` function executes a DELETE query on a SQLite database and always returns `None` (which becomes `null` in JSON).

Let me trace through the execution:
1. Connects to the database using `self.database_name`
2. Creates a DELETE query: `DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?`
3. Executes the query with the provided `name` parameter
4. Commits the transaction
5. Closes the connection
6. Returns `None` implicitly (no explicit return statement)

The output `null` indicates the function executed successfully and returned `None`. Since this function always returns `None` regardless of input values, the output doesn't uniquely determine the inputs - any input that doesn't raise an exception would produce the same `null` output.

However, reasonable typical inputs for such a function would be:
- A database file that either exists or can be created (like "test.db" or "database.db")
- A valid table name (like "users" or "employees")
- A name value to match and delete (like "John")

Given the generic nature of the function and that it completed successfully, I'll provide reasonable example inputs.
