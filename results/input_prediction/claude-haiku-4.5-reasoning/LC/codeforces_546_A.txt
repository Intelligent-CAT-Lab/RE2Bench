[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to determine what input produces an output of 0.

The code:
1. Reads three integers: k, n, w
2. Initializes sum = 0
3. Loops from i=1 to w (inclusive), adding k*i to sum each time
4. If sum <= n, prints 0
5. Otherwise prints (sum - n)

For the output to be 0, the condition `sum <= n` must be true.

The sum calculation is:
```
sum = k*1 + k*2 + ... + k*w = k*(1+2+...+w) = k*w*(w+1)/2
```

For output to be 0, we need: `k * w*(w+1)/2 <= n`

Let me choose simple values:
- k=1, n=10, w=1
- sum = 1*(1+2+...+1) = 1*1 = 1
- Is 1 <= 10? Yes
- Output: 0 ✓

This works! The input string would be "1 10 1" from the three integers separated by spaces.
