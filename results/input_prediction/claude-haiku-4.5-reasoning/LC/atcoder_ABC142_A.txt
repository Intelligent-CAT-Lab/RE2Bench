Looking at the code, it reads an integer N and:
- If N is even (N % 2 == 0): prints 0.5
- If N is odd: prints (N + 1) / N / 2

The output is 0.5050505050505051, which is NOT exactly 0.5, so N must be odd.

For odd N, we have: (N + 1) / N / 2 = 0.5050505050505051

Let me solve this algebraically:
- (N + 1) / N / 2 = (N + 1) / (2N) = 0.5050505050505051
- N + 1 = 0.5050505050505051 * 2N
- N + 1 = 1.0101010101010102N
- 1 = 0.0101010101010102N
- N = 1 / 0.0101010101010102
- N ≈ 99

Let me verify with N = 99:
- 99 is odd ✓
- (99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = 100 / 198 = 50/99
- 50/99 = 0.5050505050505051 ✓

This matches the expected output!
