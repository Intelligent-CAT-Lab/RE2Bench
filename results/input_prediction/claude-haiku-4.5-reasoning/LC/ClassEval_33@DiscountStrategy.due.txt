The `due()` method executes: `return self.__total - discount`

Where `discount` is determined by:
- If `self.promotion is None`: `discount = 0`
- Otherwise: `discount = self.promotion(self)` (returns the result of calling the promotion function)

For the output to equal 139.5:
`self.__total - discount = 139.5`

The most straightforward interpretation is that no promotion is applied:
- `promotion = None`
- `discount = 0`
- Therefore: `self.__total - 0 = 139.5`
- So: `self.__total = 139.5` ✓

For the `customer` and `cart` fields, without explicit constraints, I'll use reasonable placeholder values:
- `customer.name`: "John" (a typical customer identifier)
- `customer.fidelity`: 0 (representing a customer with no special loyalty status)
- `cart`: [] (empty list, the cart contents don't affect the calculation since `__total` is already set)
- `promotion`: null (no promotional discount applied)

Verification:
- `promotion is None` → True
- `discount = 0`
- `due()` returns `139.5 - 0 = 139.5` ✓
