[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__mul__` method to determine the inputs.

The function is:
```python
def __mul__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, float):
        return NotImplemented
    return type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)
```

The output shows:
```json
{
    "n": -1,
    "month": 2
}
```

This output represents the returned `QuarterOffset` instance.

Working backwards:
1. The function returns `type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)`
2. The returned object has `n = -1` and `month = 2`
3. Since `month` is preserved from `self.month`, we know: `self.month = 2`
4. Since `n = other * self.n = -1`, we need to find values of `other` and `self.n` that multiply to -1

Additionally, since the function returns a value (not `NotImplemented`), we know that `other` is NOT a float.

The most natural choice with integer arithmetic would be:
- `self.n = 1` and `other = -1`
  - Check: `-1 * 1 = -1` ✓
  - Check: `isinstance(-1, float)` is False ✓

This represents multiplying an offset with n=1 by -1, which negates it to n=-1.
