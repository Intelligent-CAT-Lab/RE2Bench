[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function with the given output.

The function `make_a_pile(n)` returns `[n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]`.

This creates a list where:
- For each `i` from `0` to `n-1` (since `range(n)` produces n values)
- Each element is calculated as `n + 2*i`

The output is `[3, 5, 7]`, which has 3 elements.

Since the list has 3 elements, `range(n)` must have produced 3 values, meaning `n = 3`.

Let me verify:
- When `n = 3` and `i = 0`: `3 + 2*0 = 3` ✓
- When `n = 3` and `i = 1`: `3 + 2*1 = 5` ✓
- When `n = 3` and `i = 2`: `3 + 2*2 = 7` ✓

This matches the output `[3, 5, 7]`, so `n = 3`.
