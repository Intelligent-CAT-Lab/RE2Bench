[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `monotonic(l: list)`:

The function returns `True` if:
- `l == sorted(l)` (the list is sorted in ascending order), OR
- `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` (the list is sorted in descending order)

Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given that the output is `True`, the list must satisfy at least one of these conditions.

The simplest cases that would return `True`:
1. An empty list `[]` - because `[] == sorted([])` evaluates to `True`
2. A list sorted in ascending order, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` - because `[1, 2, 3] == sorted([1, 2, 3])` evaluates to `True`
3. A list sorted in descending order, e.g., `[3, 2, 1]` - because `[3, 2, 1] == sorted([3, 2, 1], reverse=True)` evaluates to `True`
4. A single element list, e.g., `[1]` - because both conditions would be true

Any of these would work. I'll choose `[1, 2, 3]` as a straightforward example of an ascending monotonic list.
