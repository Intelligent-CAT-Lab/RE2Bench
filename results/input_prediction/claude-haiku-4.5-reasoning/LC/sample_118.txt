Let me trace through the function with the output "zbzquiuqnmfkx".

The function performs exactly 2 iterations:
- Iteration 0 (i=0): Sets `extra_chars = chars`, then removes all occurrences of `chars` from `text`
- Iteration 1 (i=1): Sets `extra_chars = chars + chars`, then removes all occurrences of `chars+chars` from the (already modified) `text`

Given output: "zbzquiuqnmfkx"

Working backwards, I need to find what `text` and `chars` could produce this output.

Let me try `chars = "a"` (a simple single character):

If `chars = "a"`, the operations would be:
- Iteration 0: Remove all 'a' from text
- Iteration 1: Remove all 'aa' from the resulting text

For this to work, I need the original `text` to contain some 'a' characters that, when removed, leave "zbzquiuqnmfkx".

Let me construct a plausible original text by inserting 'a's into "zbzquiuqnmfkx":
- Original text: "zbzaquiuaqnmfkx" (inserting 'a' characters at strategic positions)

Verification:
- Iteration 0: "zbzaquiuaqnmfkx".replace('a', '') = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" ✓
- Iteration 1: "zbzquiuqnmfkx".replace('aa', '') = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no 'aa' to remove, so unchanged) ✓
- Return: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" ✓

This matches the expected output!
