[THOUGHT]
The `clean_non_binary_chars` method takes no arguments besides `self`. It modifies `self.binary_string` by filtering out any characters that are not '0' or '1', then returns nothing (implicitly returns `None`).

Method behavior:
- It removes all non-binary characters from `self.binary_string`
- It doesn't have a return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`
- The output `null` (which is `None` in Python) is what we expect

Since the method always returns `None` regardless of what `binary_string` contains, the output `null` doesn't uniquely constrain what the input value of `binary_string` was. Any input would produce the same output.

However, for a reasonable test case of a BinaryDataProcessor, the `binary_string` would typically be a string containing binary digits possibly mixed with other characters. A simple example showing the cleaning functionality would be something like "1a0b1" or a simple binary string like "101".

I'll provide "101010" as a straightforward binary string input that makes sense for this class.
