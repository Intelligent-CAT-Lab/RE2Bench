Let me trace through the function backwards from the output:

Given output: `2`

The function `next_smallest(lst)` does:
1. `lst = sorted(set(lst))` - creates a sorted list of unique elements
2. Returns `None` if `len(lst) < 2`, otherwise returns `lst[1]` (the second element)

Since the output is `2` (not `None`), we know:
- The sorted unique list has at least 2 elements
- `lst[1] = 2` (the element at index 1 is 2)

This means the sorted unique list looks like: `[something, 2, ...]` where `something < 2`

The most natural choice for the first element would be `1`, so the sorted unique list is `[1, 2, ...]`.

For the simplest case with exactly 2 unique elements, the sorted list would be `[1, 2]`.

Any input list that produces this sorted unique list would work, such as:
- `[1, 2]`
- `[2, 1]`
- `[1, 2, 2]`
- `[1, 1, 2]`

But the simplest is `[1, 2]`.

Verification:
- `set([1, 2])` = `{1, 2}`
- `sorted({1, 2})` = `[1, 2]`
- `len([1, 2])` = `2`, which is not `< 2`
- `[1, 2][1]` = `2` ✓
