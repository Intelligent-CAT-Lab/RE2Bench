[THOUGHT]
To solve this, I need to understand what the `loads` function does:

1. The function `loads(s, ...)` calls `TimestampSigner(...).unsign_object(s, ...)` to deserialize and verify the input string `s`
2. The output is a Python dictionary: `{"a": "dictionary"}`
3. Therefore, `s` must be a signed string representation of this dictionary

Looking at the imports and code structure, Django's signing module works as follows:
- Data is serialized to JSON, then base64-encoded
- A timestamp (for TimestampSigner) is base62-encoded and appended
- An HMAC signature is computed and appended
- Format: `data.timestamp.signature` (separated by dots)

For the dictionary `{"a": "dictionary"}`:
1. JSON serialization (compact): `{"a":"dictionary"}`
2. Base64 encoding: `eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9`
3. A base62-encoded timestamp component (e.g., `ZwxYvU` represents some timestamp value)
4. An HMAC-SHA256 signature in base64 format (e.g., `kx5WlpJ9Jl9YLe_xN_z1QA`)

The `_SEP_UNSAFE` regex pattern confirms the format uses dots as separators, with each segment containing base64-alphabet characters.

Since `kwargs` is empty, the default parameters are used:
- key=None (uses Django's SECRET_KEY)
- salt='django.core.signing'
- serializer=JSONSerializer
- max_age=None
- fallback_keys=None
