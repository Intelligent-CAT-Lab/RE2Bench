[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the function logic to understand what input would produce an empty list as output.

The function has three while loops:
1. `while -1 in array: array.pop(-3)` - removes elements while -1 is present
2. `while 0 in array: array.pop()` - removes elements from the end while 0 is present  
3. `while 1 in array: array.pop(0)` - removes elements from the front while 1 is present

For the output to be an empty list `[]`, all elements must have been removed by these loops.

Let me consider the simplest possible input: an empty array `[]`

If we call `f([])`:
- `while -1 in []`: evaluates to False, so this loop is skipped
- `while 0 in []`: evaluates to False, so this loop is skipped
- `while 1 in []`: evaluates to False, so this loop is skipped
- `return []`

This produces the expected output of `[]`.

Alternatively, other valid inputs would be:
- `[1]`: The third loop would execute once, removing 1 with `pop(0)`, resulting in `[]`
- `[0]`: The second loop would execute once, removing 0 with `pop()`, resulting in `[]`

However, the simplest and most straightforward input is an empty array, which requires no processing.
