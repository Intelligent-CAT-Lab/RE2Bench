Let me trace through the function f step by step working backwards from the output "Xzd".

The function does:
1. If len(text) == 0, return ''
2. Convert text to lowercase: text = text.lower()
3. Return text[0].upper() + text[1:]

Given output: "Xzd"

Working backwards:
- The output is "Xzd" which has 3 characters
- Since the output is not empty, len(text) must not be 0
- The result is constructed as: text[0].upper() + text[1:]
- So "Xzd" = text[0].upper() + text[1:]
- This breaks down as:
  - text[0].upper() = "X"
  - text[1:] = "zd"

Now, the variable `text` is the lowercased version of the input:
- text[0].upper() = "X" means text[0] must be "x" (since "x".upper() = "X")
- text[1:] = "zd" means the rest is "zd"

So after lowercasing, text must be "xzd"

Since text = input_text.lower(), the original input could be any capitalization of "xzd", but the simplest is "xzd".

Verification:
If input is "xzd":
1. len("xzd") = 3 ≠ 0, continue
2. text = "xzd".lower() = "xzd"
3. return "xzd"[0].upper() + "xzd"[1:] = "X" + "zd" = "Xzd" ✓
