To reverse-engineer the input from the output, I need to trace through the `predict` method:

1. **Output Analysis**: The output is an array of 400 float values, which are regression predictions.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - `predict(X)` calls `check_is_fitted(self)` - requires `estimators_` attribute to exist
   - `_predict(X)` returns `np.asarray([est.predict(X) for est in self.estimators_]).T`
     - Each estimator makes a prediction on X
     - Results are stacked and transposed to shape (n_samples, n_estimators)
   - `np.average(predictions, axis=1, weights=self._weights_not_none)` averages along axis 1
     - This gives output of shape (n_samples,)

3. **Determining Input Shape**:
   - Output has 400 values → each value is the average prediction from multiple estimators for one sample
   - Therefore, X must have 400 samples (rows)
   - The number of features is not constrained by the output shape

4. **Determining Parameters**:
   - `named_estimators_` shows "pipe1" and "pipe2" → there are 2 estimators
   - Since `weights=None` most commonly leads to equal weighting (not providing specific weights)
   - `n_jobs` and `verbose` should be default values (None/False)
   - `estimators_` must be fitted (passing `check_is_fitted`)
   - The individual estimator outputs must be numeric and average to the given values

5. **Key Requirement**: 
   - X needs 400 samples with some number of features (e.g., 10 is reasonable)
   - Each estimator in `estimators_` must have a `predict(X)` method
   - When predictions from both estimators are averaged, they produce the 400 output values
