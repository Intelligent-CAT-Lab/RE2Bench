[THOUGHT]
The function `string_sequence(n)` does the following:
1. Creates a range from 0 to n (inclusive) using `range(n + 1)`
2. Converts each number in that range to a string
3. Joins them with spaces

Working backwards from the output `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`:
- The output contains numbers from 0 to 10, which means 11 numbers total
- Since `range(n + 1)` produces numbers from 0 to n (inclusive), we need `range(n + 1)` to produce 0 through 10
- This means `n + 1 = 11`, so `n = 10`

Verification:
- If `n = 10`, then `range(n + 1) = range(11) = [0, 1, 2, ..., 10]`
- Converting to strings: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']`
- Joining with spaces: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"` ✓
