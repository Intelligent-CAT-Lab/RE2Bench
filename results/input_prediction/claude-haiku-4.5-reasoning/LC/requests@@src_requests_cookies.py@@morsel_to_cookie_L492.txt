[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `morsel_to_cookie` function to understand what input would produce a `null` output.

1. The function signature: `def morsel_to_cookie(morsel):`

2. First, it checks `morsel['max-age']`:
   - If truthy, it tries to convert to int and calculate expires
   - If it can't convert, it raises TypeError
   
3. Then it checks `morsel['expires']`:
   - If truthy, it tries to parse with a specific time format
   - If format is wrong, it would raise ValueError

4. Then it calls `create_cookie()` with various parameters including:
   - `name=morsel.key`
   - `value=morsel.value`
   - `domain=morsel['domain']`
   - And others

5. In `create_cookie()`, I see this critical line:
   ```python
   result["domain_initial_dot"] = result["domain"].startswith(".")
   ```
   
   If `domain` is None, this would raise `AttributeError` because None doesn't have a `.startswith()` method.

For the output to be `null`, an exception must be raised. The most straightforward cause is setting `domain=null`, which would pass None to `create_cookie()`. When `create_cookie()` tries to call `.startswith()` on None, it fails.

I should provide:
- All fields from the structure
- Set values that will trigger an exception
- domain=null is the clearest trigger for the AttributeError
- Other fields can be falsy (null/false) to skip error checks in the max-age and expires blocks

This will cause the function to raise an exception, which gets converted to `null` output.
