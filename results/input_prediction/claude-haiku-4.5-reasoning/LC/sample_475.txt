[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function with the given output of 1.

The function f(array, index):
1. Checks if index < 0
2. If true, adjusts index by adding len(array) to it (negative indexing)
3. Returns array[index]

Since the output is 1, this means array[index] must equal 1.

Let me consider the simplest case:
- If index >= 0: The condition `index < 0` is False, so index is not modified. The function simply returns array[index].
- We need array[index] = 1

The simplest input would be:
- array = [1] (a list containing the element 1)
- index = 0 (access the first element)

Let me verify:
- f([1], 0)
- index = 0, is 0 < 0? No
- return array[0] = [1][0] = 1 ✓

This matches the expected output!

(Note: Other valid inputs exist, such as array = [5, 1], index = 1, or array = [5, 1], index = -1 (which would adjust to 1), but the simplest solution is [1], 0)
