[THOUGHT]
The `update_product_quantity` method:
1. Checks if `product_id` exists in `self.inventory`
2. If true, adds `quantity` to the existing quantity
3. Returns `None` implicitly (output is `null`)

Since the output is `null`, this is the return value of the function, which is consistent with the method executing (whether the product_id exists or not, the return is always `None`).

Given the structure shows product "1" exists in inventory with a name and quantity, the most logical input is:
- `product_id` should be "1" to match the product in inventory
- We need a product name (e.g., "Widget")
- We need an initial quantity for product "1" (e.g., 10)
- We need a quantity to add (e.g., 5)

The function executes:
1. Check: "1" is in inventory → True
2. Execute: self.inventory["1"]["quantity"] += 5 (changes 10 → 15)
3. Return: None (displayed as `null`)
