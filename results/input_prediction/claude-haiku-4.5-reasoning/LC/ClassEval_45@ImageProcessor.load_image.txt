[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `load_image` method:

```python
def load_image(self, image_path):
    self.image = Image.open(image_path)
```

The output is `"output": null`, which represents `None`. This makes sense because the `load_image` method doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`.

For the input structure:
1. **`self.image`**: Before `load_image` is called, based on the `__init__` method, `self.image` is initialized to `None`. This represents the state of the instance variable before calling the method.

2. **`image_path`**: This is the parameter passed to `load_image`. It should be a valid image file path that can be opened by `Image.open()`. A reasonable example would be a typical image filename like `"image.jpg"`.

3. **`kwargs`**: The method doesn't accept keyword arguments, so this should be an empty dictionary `{}`.
