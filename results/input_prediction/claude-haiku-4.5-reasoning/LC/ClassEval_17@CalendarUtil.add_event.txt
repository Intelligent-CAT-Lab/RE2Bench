[THOUGHT]
The `add_event` method takes an `event` parameter and appends it to `self.events`. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns `None` (shown as `null` in JSON), which matches the given output.

Working backwards:
1. The output is `null` - this is the implicit return value of the method, which is `None` in Python
2. The `__init__` method initializes `self.events` as an empty list `[]`
3. Before calling `add_event`, `self.events` would be `[]`
4. The `event` parameter needs to be provided - the structure indicates it should have date, start_time, end_time, and description fields

Since this is a calendar utility and the code imports datetime, I should provide realistic calendar event values:
- date: A date string like "2024-01-15"
- start_time: A time string like "09:00"
- end_time: A time string like "10:00"
- description: A meaningful description string

These values are arbitrary since the simple method just appends whatever is passed, but they're reasonable for a calendar event.
