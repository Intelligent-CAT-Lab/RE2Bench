Let me work through this code backwards from the output h = 80.

**First loop analysis:**
```python
while x > 0:
    x -= 1
    h += 1
    s += 1
```
This loop runs exactly `a` times (since x starts at a and decrements to 0).
After the first loop: h = a, s = a, x = 0

**Second loop analysis:**
```python
while s // b != 0:
    h += 1
    s = s - b + 1
```
This loop continues while s ≥ b. Each iteration:
- h increases by 1
- s decreases by (b - 1)

If the loop runs k times:
- h becomes: a + k = 80
- s becomes: a - k(b - 1)
- The loop stops when s < b

For the loop to stop after exactly k iterations, I need:
- Before the k-th iteration: s ≥ b, so a - (k-1)(b-1) ≥ b
- After the k-th iteration: s < b, so a - k(b-1) < b

This gives me: **1 ≤ a - k(b-1) < b**

From a + k = 80, I get a = 80 - k.

Substituting: 1 ≤ 80 - k - k(b-1) < b
Simplifying: 1 ≤ 80 - kb < b
Therefore: **(80 - b)/b < k ≤ 79/b**

Let me test various values of b:

**For b = 3:**
- (80 - 3)/3 = 77/3 ≈ 25.67
- 79/3 ≈ 26.33
- So 25.67 < k ≤ 26.33, which gives k = 26
- Therefore a = 80 - 26 = 54

**Verification with a = 54, b = 3:**
- First loop: h = 54, s = 54
- Second loop runs 26 times, each iteration s decreases by 2:
  - After 25 iterations: s = 54 - 50 = 4, h = 79
  - Iteration 26: s = 4, check 4 // 3 = 1 ≠ 0, enter loop
    - h = 80, s = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2
  - Check condition: 2 // 3 = 0, exit loop
- Final: h = 80 ✓
