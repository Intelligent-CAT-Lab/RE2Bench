The `level_up` method modifies the character's stats and returns a tuple of (level, hp, attack_power, defense).

Given output: [4, 160, 35, 25]

I need to work backwards to find the input state before level_up is called:

The method performs these operations when level < 100:
- level += 1
- exp = 0 (doesn't matter what it was before)
- hp += 20
- attack_power += 5
- defense += 5

Working backwards from the output:
- level = 4 means it was 3 before (4 - 1 = 3)
- hp = 160 means it was 140 before (160 - 20 = 140)
- attack_power = 35 means it was 30 before (35 - 5 = 30)
- defense = 25 means it was 20 before (25 - 5 = 20)

Verification: Starting with level=3, hp=140, attack_power=30, defense=20
- Since 3 < 100, the transformations apply:
  - level: 3 + 1 = 4 ✓
  - hp: 140 + 20 = 160 ✓
  - attack_power: 30 + 5 = 35 ✓
  - defense: 20 + 5 = 25 ✓

For fields not reflected in output:
- name: Not used in the output, can be any string. Using "Hero" as a generic RPG character name.
- exp: Will be set to 0 by the method, so initial value doesn't matter. Using 0 as default.
- args and kwargs: The method takes no arguments beyond self, so both are empty dicts.
