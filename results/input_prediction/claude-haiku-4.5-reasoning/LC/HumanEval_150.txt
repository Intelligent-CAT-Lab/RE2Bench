[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `x_or_y` to understand its behavior:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
            break
    else:
        return x
```

The function:
1. Returns `y` if `n == 1`
2. Returns `y` if `n` is divisible by any number in range `[2, n-1]` (i.e., `n` is composite)
3. Otherwise (when the for loop completes without finding a divisor), returns `x` via the else clause

This is essentially checking if `n` is prime: returns `x` if prime, `y` if not prime or if `n == 1`.

Since the output is `3`, I need either:
- `n` is prime (and > 1) with `x = 3`
- `n` is 1 or composite with `y = 3`

Let me verify a case where `n = 2` (the smallest prime) with `x = 3` and any other value for `y`:

```
x_or_y(2, 3, 5):
  if 2 == 1: False → skip
  for i in range(2, 2): → empty range, loop doesn't execute
  else: → since loop completed without break, execute else clause
    return x = 3
```

This returns `3` ✓

This is a reasonable test case because it:
- Uses the smallest prime number to test the actual prime-checking logic
- Returns the value of `x`, confirming that 2 is correctly identified as prime
- Uses distinct simple integer values
