[THOUGHT]
The `deposit` method adds the `amount` to `self.balance` and returns the new balance.

Given output is 300, which represents the return value (the new balance after deposit).

The formula is: new_balance = self.balance + amount = 300

We need to determine valid values for the initial balance and the deposit amount.

The deposit method checks if `amount < 0` and raises an error, so amount must be non-negative.

The simplest and most logical case is:
- self.balance = 0 (default initial balance)
- amount = 300

Verification:
- amount (300) is not < 0, so no error is raised
- self.balance = 0 + 300 = 300
- returns 300 ✓

This matches the expected output.
