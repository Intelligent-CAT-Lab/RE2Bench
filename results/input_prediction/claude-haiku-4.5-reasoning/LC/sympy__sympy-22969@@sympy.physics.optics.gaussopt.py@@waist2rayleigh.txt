Let me trace through the function `waist2rayleigh`:

```python
def waist2rayleigh(w, wavelen, n=1):
    w, wavelen = map(sympify, (w, wavelen))
    return w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen
```

The output is `"pi*w_0**2/l"`, which is the string representation of the returned sympy expression.

Working backwards from the output:
- The function computes: `w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen`
- For this to equal `pi*w_0**2/l`, I need to determine what `w`, `wavelen`, and `n` were

If I use:
- `w = "w_0"` (a string that sympify will convert to Symbol('w_0'))
- `wavelen = "l"` (a string that sympify will convert to Symbol('l'))
- `n = 1` (the default parameter)

Then the execution would be:
1. `w, wavelen = map(sympify, ("w_0", "l"))` → creates symbols `w_0` and `l`
2. `return w_0 ** 2 * 1 * pi / l`
3. This simplifies to: `pi * w_0**2 / l`
4. StringSympified: `"pi*w_0**2/l"` ✓

This matches the expected output.
