[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `unique` function backwards from the output.

The function does:
1. `set(l)` - converts the list to a set, removing any duplicates
2. `list(...)` - converts the set back to a list
3. `sorted(...)` - sorts the list in ascending order

Given output: `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`

Working backwards:
- The `sorted()` call produced `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, which means the unique elements from the input are `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`
- These are already in sorted order
- The input `l` must have contained these elements (possibly with duplicates and in any order)

The simplest valid input that would produce this output is a list containing exactly these elements. The output itself `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]` is a valid input since:
- `set([0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123])` = `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`
- `list({0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123})` = `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]` (after conversion)
- `sorted([0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123])` = `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`

Alternatively, any permutation or list with duplicates of these elements would work, such as `[9, 0, 123, 2, 5, 3, 0]`, but the simplest is the sorted list itself.
