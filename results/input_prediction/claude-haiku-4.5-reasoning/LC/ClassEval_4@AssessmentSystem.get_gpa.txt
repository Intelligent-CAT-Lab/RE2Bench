[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `get_gpa` method to determine what input would produce an output of 75.0.

The method:
1. Checks if `name` is in `self.students` and if that student has courses
2. Calculates: sum(courses values) / number of courses
3. Returns that average or None

For output = 75.0, we need:
- A student name that exists in the dictionary
- That student must have at least one course grade
- The average of their course grades must equal 75.0

I need to find what configuration works. Let me consider calling with "Bob":
- If Bob has Physics grade = 75
- Then: 75 / 1 = 75.0 ✓

This is the simplest case with just one course.

For the other students (Alice and Charlie), I can provide different grade combinations:
- Alice: Mathematics = 90, Science = 80 → (90 + 80) / 2 = 85.0
- Charlie: Chemistry = 60, Physics = 90 → (60 + 90) / 2 = 75.0

The function is called with name="Bob", which yields the required output of 75.0.

Verification:
- "Bob" is in students? ✓
- students["Bob"]["courses"] is truthy? ✓ (has {"Physics": 75})
- sum([75]) / len([75]) = 75 / 1 = 75.0 ✓
