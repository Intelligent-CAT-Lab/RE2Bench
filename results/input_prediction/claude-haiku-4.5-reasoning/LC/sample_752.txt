Let me work backwards from the output "zzzzzabc" to find the inputs.

The function is: `return (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s`

This means:
1. It multiplies (amount - len(s)) by the character 'z' to create a string of z's
2. It concatenates the string s to that

Looking at the output "zzzzzabc":
- I can see 5 'z' characters followed by "abc"
- This means: (amount - len(s)) * 'z' = "zzzzz" (5 z's)
- And: s = "abc"

From s = "abc":
- len(s) = 3

From (amount - len(s)) = 5:
- amount - 3 = 5
- amount = 8

Let me verify: (8 - 3) * 'z' + "abc" = 5 * 'z' + "abc" = "zzzzz" + "abc" = "zzzzzabc" ✓
