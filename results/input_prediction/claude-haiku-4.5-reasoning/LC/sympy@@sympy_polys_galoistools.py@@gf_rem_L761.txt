[THOUGHT]
Looking at `gf_rem`, it simply returns the remainder (index [1]) from `gf_div`:
```python
def gf_rem(f: dup[MPZ], g: dup[MPZ], p: MPZ, K: Domain[MPZ]) -> dup[MPZ]:
    return gf_div(f, g, p, K)[1]
```

The output is `[2, 0]`, so I need to find inputs where `gf_div` produces remainder `[2, 0]`.

Looking at the `gf_div` function, there's an early return case:
```python
elif df < dg:
    return [], f
```

This means if the degree of f is less than the degree of g, the remainder is simply f itself and quotient is empty.

In the dup representation (dense univariate polynomial):
- `[2, 0]` represents a polynomial with coefficients [2, 0], which has degree 1
- `gf_degree([2, 0])` = len([2, 0]) - 1 = 1

For the remainder to be `[2, 0]` via the early return, I need:
- `f = [2, 0]` (degree 1)
- `g` must have degree > 1 to satisfy `df < dg`

A simple choice is `g = [1, 0, 0]` which has degree 2.

When the function hits the early return condition:
- `df = 1 < dg = 2` ✓
- Returns `[], f` = `[], [2, 0]`
- Remainder is `[2, 0]` ✓

For `p` and `K`: since the function returns early, these values aren't used in the computation. I'll use reasonable defaults:
- `p = 5` (a prime typical for Galois fields)
- `K = {}` (representing a domain object like ZZ, similar to how the example represented non-primitive objects)
