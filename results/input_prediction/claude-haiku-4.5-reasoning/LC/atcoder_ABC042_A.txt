[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given output "YES":

1. `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` - converts the input string into a tuple of integers
2. `if ABC.count(5) == 2:` - For "YES" to be printed, this condition must be True, meaning exactly 2 elements in ABC must be 5
3. Inside the if block: `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')` - For "YES" to be printed, `sum(ABC) == 17` must be True

So the requirements are:
- The input must parse into a tuple where exactly two elements are 5
- The sum of all elements must equal 17

If we have two 5's, that already accounts for 10. The remaining element(s) must sum to 7.

The simplest solution is a tuple with exactly three elements: (5, 5, 7)
- `ABC.count(5)` = 2 ✓
- `sum(ABC)` = 5 + 5 + 7 = 17 ✓
- Output: "YES" ✓

The input string would be: "5 5 7"
