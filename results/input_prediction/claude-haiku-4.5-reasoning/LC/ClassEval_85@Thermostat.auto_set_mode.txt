[THOUGHT]
The `auto_set_mode()` method doesn't take any parameters (besides `self`) and doesn't explicitly return anything, so it will always return `None`, which appears as `null` in JSON output.

The method's logic is:
- If current_temperature < target_temperature, set mode to 'heat'
- Otherwise, set mode to 'cool'
- Return None (implicitly)

Since any valid input will produce the same output (`null`), I need to provide reasonable thermostat values. A typical scenario would be:
- current_temperature: 20 (room is currently 20 degrees)
- target_temperature: 25 (desired temperature is 25 degrees)
- mode: "off" (initial state before auto_set_mode runs)

When `auto_set_mode()` executes:
- 20 < 25 evaluates to True
- mode gets set to 'heat'
- Method returns None → `null` in output
