[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function step by step:

```python
def calc_max_rows_first(max_rows: int) -> int:
    return max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2
```

The output is 6, so I need to find what input `max_rows` produces an output of 6.

This function essentially computes: `ceil(max_rows / 2)` (ceiling of max_rows divided by 2)

Let me work backwards from the output:
- For even numbers: `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2 = max_rows/2 + 0 = max_rows/2`
  - If max_rows = 12: 12 // 2 + 12 % 2 = 6 + 0 = 6 ✓
  
- For odd numbers: `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2 = (max_rows-1)/2 + 1 = (max_rows+1)/2`
  - If max_rows = 11: 11 // 2 + 11 % 2 = 5 + 1 = 6 ✓

Both 11 and 12 produce output 6. However, given the context of display code where this function is used (for truncating array/dataframe displays), the value 12 is more reasonable as it represents a symmetric display pattern (show 6 rows first, 6 rows last) rather than the less natural value of 11.

Therefore, `max_rows = 12`.
