Let me trace through the code step by step with the given output "1 0":

The output has two parts:
- "1" (followed by a space)
- "0"

From the code flow:
1. `print(min(x), end=' ')` outputs the first part, so `min(x) = 1`
2. The second part "0" comes from the if-else statement:
   - If `abs(a - b) >= 2` is True: prints `abs(a - b) // 2`
   - If `abs(a - b) >= 2` is False: prints `0`

Since the output is "0", the condition `abs(a - b) >= 2` must be False, meaning `abs(a - b) < 2`. This means the difference between a and b is 0 or 1.

Since `min(x) = 1`, all elements in the list must be >= 1, with at least one element equal to 1.

The simplest case that satisfies both conditions:
- `a = 1, b = 1` → `x = [1, 1]`
- `min([1, 1]) = 1` ✓
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0 < 2` (condition is False, so prints 0) ✓

Verification:
- Input: "1 1"
- `x = [1, 1]` after splitting and converting to int
- `a = 1, b = 1`
- `print(min([1, 1]), end=' ')` → "1 "
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0`, which is < 2, so condition is False
- `print(0)` → "0"
- Output: "1 0" ✓
