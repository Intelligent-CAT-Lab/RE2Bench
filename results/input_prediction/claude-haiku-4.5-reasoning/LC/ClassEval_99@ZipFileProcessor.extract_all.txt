[THOUGHT]
The `extract_all` method returns `False` when an exception occurs in the try block. This means one of the following happened:
1. `self.file_name` doesn't exist or is not a valid zip file
2. The zip file cannot be opened with `zipfile.ZipFile()`
3. `output_path` is invalid or inaccessible
4. Permission issues prevent extraction

The most common reason for this method to return `False` is that the file specified by `file_name` either:
- Doesn't exist (FileNotFoundError)
- Is not a valid zip file (BadZipFile exception)
- Cannot be opened for reading

For the output to be `False`, we need an input that triggers an exception. A straightforward scenario is providing a file path that doesn't exist or is not a zip file.

Example inputs that would cause exceptions:
- `file_name`: "nonexistent.zip" (file doesn't exist)
- `output_path`: "./output" (any valid output path)

When trying to open "nonexistent.zip", a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised, caught by the except block, and `False` will be returned.
