Let me work through the _jaccard function to determine what inputs would produce an output of 1.0.

The Jaccard similarity formula is:
```
intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection)
```

For this to equal 1.0:
```
intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection) = 1.0
intersection = a_size + b_size - intersection
2 * intersection = a_size + b_size
```

This simplifies to: intersection = a_size = b_size

The simplest case is when all four parameters are identical. Let me trace through with all parameters being [1]:

- intersection = ([1] * [1]).sum() * ([1] * [1]).sum() 
  = [1].sum() * [1].sum()
  = 1 * 1 = 1
  
- a_size = [1].sum() * [1].sum()
  = 1 * 1 = 1
  
- b_size = [1].sum() * [1].sum()
  = 1 * 1 = 1
  
- return = 1 / (1 + 1 - 1) = 1 / 1 = 1.0 ✓

This works! When all four arrays are identical and non-empty, we get perfect Jaccard similarity of 1.0.
