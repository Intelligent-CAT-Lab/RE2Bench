[THOUGHT]
1. The `parse` function takes a `version` string as input and returns either a `Version` or `LegacyVersion` object.

2. It first tries to create a `Version(version)` object. If this succeeds, it returns the `Version` object. If it raises `InvalidVersion`, it falls back to creating a `LegacyVersion`.

3. The output shows `<Version('1.11.3')>`, which is the string representation (repr) of a `Version` object. This tells us:
   - The `Version(version)` call succeeded (no exception was raised)
   - The version was parsed into version 1.11.3

4. Looking at the `Version.__init__` code, it parses the input string using regex to extract components:
   - epoch (optional, defaults to 0)
   - release (the main version numbers like 1.11.3)
   - pre-release, post-release, dev, and local versions (optional)

5. For the output `<Version('1.11.3')>`, the parsed components would be:
   - epoch: 0 (not specified in output)
   - release: (1, 11, 3)
   - No pre, post, dev, or local versions

6. The simplest input string that would produce this output is "1.11.3", which matches the semantic versioning pattern and would be parsed by the regex into exactly the version shown in the output.
