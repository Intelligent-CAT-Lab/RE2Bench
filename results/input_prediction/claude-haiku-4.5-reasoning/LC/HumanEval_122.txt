Let me trace through the function `add_elements(arr, k)`:

1. The function takes the first k elements: `arr[:k]`
2. Filters them to only keep elements where `len(str(elem)) <= 2`
3. Sums the filtered elements

The output is 24.

I need to find values of `arr` and `k` that satisfy this.

Let me think about what numbers satisfy `len(str(elem)) <= 2`:
- Single digit positive numbers: 0-9 (length 1)
- Negative single digit numbers: -1 to -9 (length 2, e.g., "-1")
- Two-digit positive numbers: 10-99 (length 2)
- Numbers >= 100 would have length >= 3, so they're excluded
- Numbers <= -10 would have length >= 3, so they're excluded

So valid numbers are: -9 to -1 and 0 to 99

To get a sum of 24, I could use:
- arr = [24], k = 1: arr[:1] = [24], len(str(24)) = 2 ≤ 2, so sum = 24 ✓
- arr = [6, 6, 6, 6], k = 4: arr[:4] = [6, 6, 6, 6], each has length 1, sum = 24 ✓
- arr = [12, 12], k = 2: arr[:2] = [12, 12], len(str(12)) = 2, sum = 24 ✓

The simplest solution is arr = [24], k = 1.

Let me verify: 
- `arr[:1]` = [24]
- `len(str(24))` = 2, which is ≤ 2, so 24 is included
- `sum([24])` = 24 ✓
