[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what produces the output.

1. The `get_n_splits` method is defined as:
```python
def get_n_splits(self, X=None, y=None, groups=None):
    return self.n_splits
```

2. The output is `{"output": 3}`, which means the function returns `3`.

3. Since `get_n_splits` simply returns `self.n_splits`, this means `self.n_splits` must equal `3`.

4. For `self.n_splits` to be `3`, it must have been set during `__init__`:
   - `n_splits` must be an Integral type
   - When converted to int: `n_splits > 1` (requirement: n_splits must be at least 2)
   - The value `3` satisfies this constraint

5. The `self` object also has `shuffle` and `random_state` attributes that must satisfy the validation rules in `__init__`:
   - `shuffle` must be a bool (True or False)
   - If `shuffle` is False and `random_state` is not None, a ValueError is raised
   - A safe combination is: `shuffle = True` (or False with `random_state = None`)

6. The parameters `X`, `y`, and `groups` in `get_n_splits` are not used in the function body, so they can all be `None` (their default values).

7. A valid configuration that produces output `3` would be:
   - `n_splits = 3`
   - `shuffle = True` (or False)
   - `random_state = None`
   - `X = None, y = None, groups = None`
