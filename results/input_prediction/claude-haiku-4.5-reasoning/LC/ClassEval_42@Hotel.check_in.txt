# [THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `check_in` method to understand when it returns `None` (which appears as `null` in JSON).

The method has two explicit `return False` statements:
1. When `room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()`
2. When `room_number > self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`

However, the output is `null`, meaning the function returns `None` implicitly (no explicit return). This happens when:
- The first condition `room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()` is False (so `room_type` IS in booked_rooms)
- AND the second condition `name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]` is False (so we skip the inner if block entirely)
- The function reaches the end without returning anything, implicitly returning `None`

Given the structure constraint that `booked_rooms` is `{"single": {}}`:
- For the first condition to be False: `room_type` must be `"single"` (which exists in booked_rooms)
- For the second condition to be False: `name` must not be in `booked_rooms["single"]`, which is an empty dict {}, so any name works
- `room_number` is irrelevant since the name check fails

Trace with room_type="single", name="John", room_number=1:
1. `if "single" not in ["single"]` → False, continue
2. `if "John" in {}` → False, skip the entire block
3. Function ends without return → implicitly returns `None` ✓
