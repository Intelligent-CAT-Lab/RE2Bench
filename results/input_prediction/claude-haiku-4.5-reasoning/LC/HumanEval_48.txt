[THOUGHT]
The function `is_palindrome` checks if a text string is a palindrome by comparing each character at position `i` with the character at the mirrored position from the end (`len(text) - 1 - i`).

If any pair of characters doesn't match, the function returns `False`.
If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`.

Given that the output is `false`, this means the function found at least one pair of characters that don't match between the character at position `i` and its mirror position.

To produce `False`, we need a non-palindrome string. The simplest example would be a string where at least the first and last characters differ.

For example, with text = "ab":
- len(text) = 2
- i = 0:
  - text[0] = 'a'
  - text[len(text) - 1 - 0] = text[1] = 'b'
  - 'a' != 'b' is True
  - return False ✓

This matches the expected output.
