[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what happens:

The function `f(nums)` reverses the list `len(nums) - 1` times and returns it.

Given output: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

The output list has 7 elements, so `len(nums) = 7`. This means the loop runs `7 - 1 = 6` times, so the list is reversed 6 times.

A key insight: reversing a list an even number of times returns it to its original state, while reversing it an odd number of times returns the reversed version.

Since the list is reversed 6 times (an even number), the output must equal the input.

Let me verify:
- Start: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
- After 1st reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After 2nd reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- After 3rd reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After 4th reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- After 5th reverse: `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- After 6th reverse: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Yes, after 6 reversals, we return to the original list.
