[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. `n = int(input())` - We need to find n
2. `i, j = (1, n * n)` - i starts at 1, j starts at n²
3. The while loop prints pairs (i, j) while i < j, incrementing i and decrementing j

Looking at the output:
- First line: 1 64 → This tells us j_initial = 64 = n * n
- Last line: 32 33 → This is the last iteration where i < j

From j_initial = 64 = n²:
- n² = 64
- n = 8

Let me verify this works:
- i starts at 1, j starts at 64
- Loop iteration 1: print(1, 64), then i=2, j=63
- Loop iteration 2: print(2, 63), then i=3, j=62
- ...
- Loop iteration 32: print(32, 33), then i=33, j=32
- Check: 33 < 32? No, so loop terminates

Counting the output lines, I can see it goes from "1 64" to "32 33", which is 32 iterations. This matches the pattern where i goes from 1 to 32 and j goes from 64 down to 33.

Therefore, n = 8
