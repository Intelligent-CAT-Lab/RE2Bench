[THOUGHT]
The function `get_positive` filters a list to keep only positive elements (elements where `e > 0`).

Given the output `[4, 5, 6]`, I need to determine what input list would produce this result.

The function iterates through each element in list `l` and includes it in the result only if `e > 0`.

For the output to be `[4, 5, 6]`:
- The element 4 must be in the input list (4 > 0 ✓)
- The element 5 must be in the input list (5 > 0 ✓)
- The element 6 must be in the input list (6 > 0 ✓)

The simplest input that produces this exact output is a list containing exactly these three positive numbers: `[4, 5, 6]`.

Note: The input could theoretically also contain non-positive elements (0, negative numbers) which would be filtered out, but the most direct answer is the minimal list that produces the output.
