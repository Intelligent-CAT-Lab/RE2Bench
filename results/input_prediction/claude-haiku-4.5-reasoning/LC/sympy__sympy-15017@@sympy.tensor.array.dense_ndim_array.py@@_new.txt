[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_new` method to understand what inputs would produce the given output.

From the output:
- `_rank: 2` → This comes from `self._rank = len(shape)`, so shape must have 2 elements
- `_loop_size: 4` → This comes from `functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, shape, 1)`, so the product of shape elements must be 4
- `_array: null` → This comes from `self._array = list(flat_list)`. If flat_list is empty (an empty Tuple), list() of it would be empty
- `_shape: {}` → This is `Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))`

With rank=2 and product=4, possible shapes are (2,2), (1,4), or (4,1). The most natural is (2,2).

Working backwards through the code:
1. If `shape = (2, 2)`, then:
   - `len(shape) = 2` ✓ matches `_rank = 2`
   - `2 * 2 = 4` ✓ matches `_loop_size = 4`

2. If `_array = null` (meaning empty), then `flat_list` must be empty (an empty Tuple)

3. The `iterable` in the structure is defined as a Matrix object with `rows`, `cols`, and `_mat` fields
   - For consistency with shape (2,2), the matrix should be 2x2
   - For `_array` to be empty (null), the matrix data `_mat` should be empty

4. The `flat_list` comes from `cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)`
   - If shape is provided as (2,2) and iterable is a 2x2 Matrix with empty data
   - It would return shape=(2,2) and flat_list=[]

5. After flattening empty list and converting to Tuple: `flat_list = Tuple()` (empty)
   - Then `list(Tuple()) = []`, which in JSON shows as `null`

So the inputs should be:
- iterable: Matrix with rows=2, cols=2, _mat=[] (empty matrix)
- shape: [2, 2] (2 elements that multiply to 4)
- kwargs: {} (empty)
