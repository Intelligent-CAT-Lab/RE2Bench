Let me analyze when the `skewness` function returns 0.

The function returns 0 in two scenarios:

1. When `std_deviation == 0`: This occurs when all data points are equal (constant list). The `else 0` clause is triggered directly.

2. When `std_deviation != 0` but `sum(((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data)) = 0`: This happens for symmetric distributions where positive and negative deviations from the mean cancel out.

Let me test case 2 with `data = [1, 2, 3]`:
- n = 3
- mean = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2
- variance = ((1-2)² + (2-2)² + (3-2)²) / 3 = (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 2/3
- std_deviation = √(2/3) ≠ 0
- sum of cubes = (1-2)³ + (2-2)³ + (3-2)³ = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
- skewness = 0 × 3 / ((3-1) × (3-2) × (√(2/3))³) = 0 / (...) = 0

This is the canonical example of a symmetric distribution where skewness = 0. The three numbers are perfectly symmetric around the mean, causing the sum of cubed deviations to be exactly zero.

Alternatively, any constant list like [1, 1, 1] would also work, but [1, 2, 3] is more pedagogically meaningful as it demonstrates the key statistical property that symmetric distributions have zero skewness.
