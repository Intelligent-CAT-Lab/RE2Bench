[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `template_changed` function to understand what input would produce the output `true`.

The function logic is:
1. If `file_path.suffix == '.py'`, return immediately (with None)
2. Iterate through template directories from `get_template_directories()`
3. If any template_dir is found in `file_path.parents`, call `reset_loaders()` and return `True`
4. Otherwise, the function ends (returns None implicitly)

Since the output is `true`, the function must have returned `True`, which means:
- `file_path.suffix` is NOT `.py` (so it doesn't return early)
- At least one template directory from `get_template_directories()` is in `file_path.parents`

For a file to be "inside" a template directory, its parent directories must include the template directory path. For example:
- If template_dir = `/app/templates`
- And file_path = `/app/templates/base.html`
- Then file_path.parents = `(/app/templates, /app, /)`
- The condition `template_dir in file_path.parents` would be True

So I need to choose:
1. A `file_path` with a non-.py suffix (e.g., `.html`)
2. A path that has at least one template directory in its parents

For the `sender` argument, since it's not used in the function, any value works. I'll use `null`.

For `file_path`, I'll use a typical Django template file path: `/app/templates/base.html`

This assumes that `/app/templates` is one of the configured template directories in the Django settings, which is a standard Django project structure.

When the function executes:
1. `file_path.suffix` = `.html` ≠ `.py`, so it continues
2. It iterates through template directories and finds `/app/templates` in the parents
3. It returns `True`
