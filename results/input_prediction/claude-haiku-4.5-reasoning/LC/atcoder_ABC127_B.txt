Let me work backwards from the output to find r, D, and x.

The code performs: `x = r * x - D` for 10 iterations and prints x each time.

Given outputs: 110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220

Let me denote initial x as x₀. After each iteration:
- Iteration 1: r * x₀ - D = 110
- Iteration 2: r * 110 - D = 120
- Iteration 3: r * 120 - D = 140
- Iteration 4: r * 140 - D = 180

To find r and D, I'll use consecutive equations:
- r * 110 - D = 120 ... (a)
- r * 120 - D = 140 ... (b)

Subtracting (a) from (b):
r * 120 - r * 110 = 140 - 120
r * (120 - 110) = 20
r * 10 = 20
r = 2

Substituting r = 2 into equation (a):
2 * 110 - D = 120
220 - D = 120
D = 100

Now finding initial x from the first equation:
r * x₀ - D = 110
2 * x₀ - 100 = 110
2 * x₀ = 210
x₀ = 105

Let me verify:
- x₁ = 2 * 105 - 100 = 110 ✓
- x₂ = 2 * 110 - 100 = 120 ✓
- x₃ = 2 * 120 - 100 = 140 ✓
- x₄ = 2 * 140 - 100 = 180 ✓
- ...continuing this pattern matches all outputs ✓

So the input is: r=2, D=100, x=105
