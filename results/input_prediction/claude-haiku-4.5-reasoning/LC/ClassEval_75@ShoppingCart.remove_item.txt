[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `remove_item` function:

```python
def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):
    if item in self.items:
        self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
    else:
        pass
```

The output is `null`, which is Python's `None`. Since the function has no explicit return statement, it always returns `None` regardless of which branch executes.

For the input, I need to determine:
1. The price of apple (currently in items)
2. The initial quantity of apple
3. Which item is being removed

Since the output is always `None`, any reasonable values would work. However, given that "apple" is explicitly shown in the structure with price and quantity fields, the most logical scenario is that we're removing "apple" from the cart.

Reasonable values:
- price: A typical item price like 2
- quantity: A reasonable starting quantity like 5
- item: "apple" (the item we're removing from the cart)

When `remove_item("apple", quantity=1)` is called (with default quantity=1), it checks if "apple" is in self.items (which it is), then decrements its quantity from 5 to 4, and returns None implicitly.
