[THOUGHT]
The `__format_line_feed` function takes a text parameter and uses a regex to replace consecutive newlines with a single newline:
```python
re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)
```

The regex pattern `\n+` matches one or more consecutive newline characters and replaces each match with a single `\n`.

Given the output is `"Some sentence here."` with no visible newlines in the JSON representation, I need to work backwards:

- If the output contains no newlines, then after the replacement operation, there are no newlines in the result
- The regex only replaces sequences of newlines with single newlines - it doesn't remove newlines entirely
- Therefore, if the output has no newlines, the input must also have no newlines (since the function doesn't remove newlines, only consolidates multiple consecutive ones)

The simplest case: 
- Input: `"Some sentence here."` (no newlines)
- The regex finds no matches with `\n+`
- Output: `"Some sentence here."` (unchanged)

This matches the given output exactly.
