[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the input.

The function rescales numbers to the range [0, 1] using min-max normalization:
- `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`

The output is: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

Key observations:
1. The output has 5 elements, so the input must also have 5 elements
2. The output values are equally spaced (difference of 0.25 between consecutive elements)
3. The first element is 0.0, which means the first input element equals min_number
4. The last element is 1.0, which means the last input element equals max_number

For an equally-spaced output [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], the input must also be equally spaced.

If the input is [a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d]:
- min = a, max = a+4d, range = 4d
- For output[1]: (a+d - a) / (4d) = d / (4d) = 1/4 = 0.25 ✓

So any arithmetic sequence works. Common choices:
- [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] (with a=0, d=1)
- [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] (with a=1, d=1)

Let me verify [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]:
- min_number = 1.0
- max_number = 5.0
- range = 4.0
- (1.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.0 ✓
- (2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.25 ✓
- (3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.5 ✓
- (4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.75 ✓
- (5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 1.0 ✓

This matches the expected output perfectly and represents typical data that would need rescaling.
