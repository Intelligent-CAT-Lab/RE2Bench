[THOUGHT]
Let me work through this step by step.

The function `filter_by_substring` returns a list containing only strings from the input `strings` list where `substring` is found.

Given output: `["grunt", "prune"]`

This means:
1. Both "grunt" and "prune" contain the substring
2. These strings were in the original list in this order (since list comprehensions preserve order)
3. Any other strings in the original list either don't exist or don't contain the substring

Let me identify common substrings in both "grunt" and "prune":
- "g" is in "grunt" but not "prune"
- "p" is in "prune" but not "grunt"
- "r" is in both "grunt" and "prune"
- "u" is in both "grunt" and "prune"
- "n" is in both "grunt" and "prune"
- "run" is in "g**run**t" and "p**run**e"
- "un" is in "gr**un**t" and "pr**un**e"

Any of these would work. The most likely inputs are:
- strings = ["grunt", "prune"] with substring = "un" (or "run" or "r" or "u" or "n")
- Or a longer list with other strings that don't contain the substring

The most reasonable minimal answer would be:
- strings = ["grunt", "prune"]
- substring = "un" (a short, clear substring present in both)
