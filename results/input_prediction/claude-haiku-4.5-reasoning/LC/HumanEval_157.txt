[THOUGHT]
The function `right_angle_triangle` checks if three numbers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. It returns `true` if any of these three conditions are satisfied:
1. a² = b² + c² (a is the hypotenuse)
2. b² = a² + c² (b is the hypotenuse)  
3. c² = a² + b² (c is the hypotenuse)

Since the output is `true`, at least one of these conditions must be true.

The most common Pythagorean triple is (3, 4, 5), where 3² + 4² = 5². Let me verify if a=3, b=4, c=5 works:
- a * a == b * b + c * c: 3*3 == 4*4 + 5*5 → 9 == 16 + 25 = 41 ✗
- b * b == a * a + c * c: 4*4 == 3*3 + 5*5 → 16 == 9 + 25 = 34 ✗
- c * c == a * a + b * b: 5*5 == 3*3 + 4*4 → 25 == 9 + 16 = 25 ✓

The third condition is true, so the function returns `true` ✓

Alternatively, I could also use a=5, b=3, c=4:
- a * a == b * b + c * c: 5*5 == 3*3 + 4*4 → 25 == 9 + 16 = 25 ✓

Either works. I'll use a=3, b=4, c=5 as it represents the standard Pythagorean triple.
