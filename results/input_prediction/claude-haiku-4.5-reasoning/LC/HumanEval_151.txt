[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input produces an output of 0.

The function `double_the_difference(lst)` does the following:
1. Creates a list of squared values for elements in `lst` that satisfy ALL three conditions:
   - `i > 0`: the element is positive
   - `i % 2 != 0`: the element is odd (not divisible by 2)
   - `'.' not in str(i)`: the string representation doesn't contain a decimal point (so it's an integer, not a float)
2. Returns the sum of these squared values

The output is 0, which is the result of summing an empty list or summing no elements.

For the sum to be 0, the list comprehension must produce an empty list. This happens when:
- The input list is empty, OR
- The input list contains only elements that fail at least one of the three filter conditions

Since positive odd integers squared are always positive (1→1, 3→9, 5→25, etc.), the only way to get a sum of 0 is for no elements to pass all three conditions.

The simplest input that would produce this output is an empty list `[]`:
- Iterating over an empty list produces no elements
- The sum of an empty list is 0

Let me verify: `sum([i ** 2 for i in [] if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and ('.' not in str(i))]) = sum([]) = 0` ✓
