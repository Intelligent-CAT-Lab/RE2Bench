[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input values.

The code does:
1. Read two integers: `vamshi` and `z`
2. Compute and print: `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`

Given that the output is 15, I need to find `vamshi` and `z` such that:
`(vamshi // z + 1) * z = 15`

Let me denote `q = vamshi // z` (integer division result). Then:
`(q + 1) * z = 15`

Since 15 = 3 × 5 = 5 × 3 = 15 × 1 = 1 × 15, I can explore different factorizations:

**Case 1: z = 5**
- `(q + 1) * 5 = 15`
- `q + 1 = 3`
- `q = 2`
- So `vamshi // 5 = 2`, which means `vamshi ∈ [10, 14]`
- Let's check with `vamshi = 10`: `(10 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (2 + 1) * 5 = 15` ✓

**Case 2: z = 3**
- `(q + 1) * 3 = 15`
- `q + 1 = 5`
- `q = 4`
- So `vamshi // 3 = 4`, which means `vamshi ∈ [12, 14]`
- Let's check with `vamshi = 12`: `(12 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (4 + 1) * 3 = 15` ✓

**Case 3: z = 1**
- `(q + 1) * 1 = 15`
- `q + 1 = 15`
- `q = 14`
- So `vamshi = 14`: `(14 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 15 * 1 = 15` ✓

All cases are valid. I'll select `vamshi = 10, z = 5` as a reasonable solution.
