[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given output.

The code:
1. Reads two integers h and a from input
2. Computes `math.ceil(h / a)` and prints the result

The output is `6`, so we need: `math.ceil(h / a) = 6`

For the ceiling of h/a to equal 6, we need:
- 5 < h/a ≤ 6, which means 5*a < h ≤ 6*a

Let me find valid values:
- If a = 1: 5 < h ≤ 6, so h = 6 works. Check: math.ceil(6/1) = 6 ✓
- If a = 2: 10 < h ≤ 12, so h = 11 or 12 work. 
  - Check h = 11: math.ceil(11/2) = math.ceil(5.5) = 6 ✓
  - Check h = 12: math.ceil(12/2) = math.ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓

I'll choose h = 11 and a = 2, since this meaningfully tests the ceiling operation (non-trivial division).

The input format is "h a" separated by space, so the input should be "11 2".
