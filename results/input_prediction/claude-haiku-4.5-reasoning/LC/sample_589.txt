[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `f` step by step:

The function does:
1. `num.append(num[-1])` - appends the last element of the list to itself
2. `return num` - returns the modified list

Given the output: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`

Working backwards:
- After execution, the output is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`
- The function appended the last element to the list
- The last two elements are identical: `1` and `1`
- This means: `num[-1]` before the append was `1`
- So before the append, the list must have been `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`

Verification:
- Input: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`
- `num[-1]` = `1`
- After `append(1)`: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` ✓
- This matches the given output
