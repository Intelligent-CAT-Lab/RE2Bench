Let me work backwards from the output to find the input values.

The code takes four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2
It calculates:
- a = x2 - x1
- b = y2 - y1

And prints: x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a

The output is: 101 99 101 100

So I need:
1. x2 - b = 101
2. y2 + a = 99
3. x1 - b = 101
4. y1 + a = 100

Rewriting with substitutions:
1. x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101 → x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
2. y2 + (x2 - x1) = 99 → y2 + x2 - x1 = 99
3. x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101 → x1 - y2 + y1 = 101
4. y1 + (x2 - x1) = 100 → y1 + x2 - x1 = 100

From equations 1 and 3:
- x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
- x1 - y2 + y1 = 101

This means: x2 = x1

From equation 4: y1 + x2 - x1 = 100
Since x2 = x1: y1 + 0 = 100 → y1 = 100

From equation 2: y2 + x2 - x1 = 99
Since x2 = x1: y2 + 0 = 99 → y2 = 99

From equation 1: x2 - 99 + 100 = 101
x2 + 1 = 101 → x2 = 100

Since x1 = x2: x1 = 100

Verification:
- a = 100 - 100 = 0
- b = 99 - 100 = -1
- x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99 ✓
- x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100 ✓
