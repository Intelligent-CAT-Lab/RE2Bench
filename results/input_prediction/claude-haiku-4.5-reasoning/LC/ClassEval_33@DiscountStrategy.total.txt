The `total` method calculates the sum of `quantity * price` for each item in the cart:

```python
def total(self):
    self.__total = sum((item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.cart))
    return self.__total
```

Given the output is 250.0, I need to find a cart configuration where the sum of all (quantity × price) equals 250.0.

The `total()` method only depends on `self.cart`, not on customer or promotion. So I need to construct a cart that produces 250.0.

Simple example:
- One item with quantity=5 and price=50.0
- Calculation: 5 × 50.0 = 250.0 ✓

For the customer object, since it's not used in the `total()` method, I can use any reasonable values. Same for promotion, which can be None since it's not used.

Verification:
- cart = [{"quantity": 5, "price": 50.0}]
- sum([5 × 50.0]) = sum([250.0]) = 250.0 ✓
