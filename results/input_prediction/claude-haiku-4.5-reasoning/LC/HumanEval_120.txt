[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input values for `arr` and `k`.

The function returns `ans = arr[-k:]` (the last k elements of a sorted array).

Given output: `[-4, 4]`

So `arr[-k:] = [-4, 4]`

From the output, I can see:
1. The output has 2 elements, so `k = 2` (we're taking the last 2 elements)
2. After sorting, `arr[-2:]` should equal `[-4, 4]`
3. This means the sorted array ends with the elements `-4` and `4` in that order

Since `-4 < 4`, a sorted array containing `[-4, 4]` at the end could be:
- Simply `[-4, 4]` itself (2 elements)
- Or `[..., -4, 4]` with other elements before

The minimal case would be an array with exactly these 2 elements. Since the function sorts the array in ascending order (default Python sort), the original unsorted array could be:
- `[4, -4]` (reversed order)
- Or `[-4, 4]` (already in order)

Let me verify with `arr = [4, -4]` and `k = 2`:
1. `k == 0` ? No, so continue
2. `arr.sort()` → `arr = [-4, 4]`
3. `ans = arr[-2:]` → `ans = [-4, 4]`
4. `return [-4, 4]` ✓

This matches the expected output.
