The function `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int` implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

The algorithm:
1. While b is non-zero, it repeatedly replaces (a, b) with (b, a % b)
2. When b becomes 0, it returns a (which will be the GCD)

Given that the output is 5, I need to find inputs a and b where GCD(a, b) = 5.

Let me trace through with a=10, b=5:
- Initial: a=10, b=5
- Iteration 1: Check `while 5:` (true)
  - a, b = (5, 10 % 5) = (5, 0)
- Iteration 2: Check `while 0:` (false, exit loop)
- return a = 5 ✓

This works! Another valid example would be a=15, b=10 or a=20, b=15, etc. But a=10, b=5 is a clean, straightforward example where one number is a multiple of the other.
