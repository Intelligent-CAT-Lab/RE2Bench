[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function step by step.

The function f(txt, marker):
1. Creates an empty list `a`
2. Splits `txt` by newlines into `lines`
3. For each line, appends `line.center(marker)` to `a`
4. Joins the result back with newlines

The output is: `"#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"`

When we join lines with '\n', we can split the output to identify what the centered lines must be:
- Line 1 after centering: `"#[)[]>[^e>"` (10 characters)
- Line 2 after centering: `" 8"` (1 space + "8" = 2 characters)

Now I need to work backwards to find what original lines and marker value produce this output.

Key insight: Python's `str.center(width)` behaves as follows:
- If `len(string) >= width`, it returns the string unchanged
- Otherwise, it pads the string with spaces to the specified width

For line 1: `"#[)[]>[^e>"` has length 10
- For this to remain unchanged after centering, we need `marker >= 10` OR `marker <= 10` if the original is already 10 characters

For line 2: `" 8"` has length 2
- If `marker >= 3`, the centering would add padding and make the result longer than 2 characters
- For example, `" 8".center(3)` would add padding → length becomes 3
- So for the result to be exactly " 8" (length 2), we need `marker <= 2`

This means:
- `marker` must be ≤ 2 (so line 2 stays exactly 2 characters)
- `marker` must be ≤ 10 (for line 1 to be at least 10 characters, or the original is 10)

If `marker = 2`:
- `"#[)[]>[^e>".center(2)` → length 10 > 2, so returns unchanged: `"#[)[]>[^e>"` ✓
- `" 8".center(2)` → length 2 = 2, so returns unchanged: `" 8"` ✓
- Joined result: `"#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"` ✓

This means the original txt must be `"#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"` with marker = 2.
