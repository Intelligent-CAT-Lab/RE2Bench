[THOUGHT]
The function `compare` takes two parameters `game` and `guess` and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

Given the output `[2, 0, 0, 1]`, I need to find values for `game` and `guess` such that:
- `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`
- `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0`
- `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0`
- `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`

For any element where the absolute difference is 0, those positions must have equal values (game[i] = guess[i]).

For the first element, I need values where the difference is 2. Common options include: (2, 0), (3, 1), (5, 3), etc.

For the fourth element, I need values where the absolute difference is 1. Common options include: (3, 2), (4, 3), (7, 6), etc.

A simple and reasonable solution would be:
- game = [2, 1, 2, 3]
- guess = [0, 1, 2, 2]

Verification:
- abs(2 - 0) = 2 ✓
- abs(1 - 1) = 0 ✓
- abs(2 - 2) = 0 ✓
- abs(3 - 2) = 1 ✓
