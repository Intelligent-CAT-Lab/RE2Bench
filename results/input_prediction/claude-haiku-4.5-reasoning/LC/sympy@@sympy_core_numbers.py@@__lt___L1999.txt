Let me trace through the `__lt__` method execution step by step:

1. The method signature is `def __lt__(self, other)` where `self` is an Integer instance and `other` is the value to compare against.

2. Looking at the code flow:
   ```python
   other = _sympify(other)  # Convert other to a sympy object
   if other.is_Integer:     # Check if it's an Integer
       return _sympify(self.p < other.p)  # Compare numerators
   ```

3. For the output to be `"False"`, the comparison `self.p < other.p` must evaluate to `False`, meaning `self.p >= other.p`.

4. Since Integer is a Rational with denominator q=1, an Integer has:
   - `p`: the numerator (integer value)
   - `q`: the denominator (always 1 for Integer)

5. To get `False` output, I need `self.p` to be greater than or equal to `other.p`. 

6. For example:
   - If `self` = Integer(1) with p=1, q=1
   - And `other` = Integer(0) with p=0, q=1
   - Then `1 < 0` evaluates to `False`
   - `_sympify(False)` returns the sympy False object, which when converted to string shows as `"False"`

7. This matches the expected output.
