[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `any_int(x, y, z)` backwards from the output.

The function returns `True` when:
1. All three parameters (x, y, z) are integers (checked by isinstance checks)
2. At least one of these equations is true:
   - x + y == z
   - x + z == y
   - y + z == x

The output is `true`, so the function must have returned `True`.

This means all three parameters must be integers, and one of the three sum equations must be satisfied.

Let me find a simple example:
- If x = 1, y = 2, z = 3:
  - isinstance(1, int) = True ✓
  - isinstance(2, int) = True ✓
  - isinstance(3, int) = True ✓
  - x + y == z? → 1 + 2 == 3? → 3 == 3? → True ✓
  - The function returns True ✓

This matches the expected output.
