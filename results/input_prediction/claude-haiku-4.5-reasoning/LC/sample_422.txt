[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The function does the following:
1. Makes a copy of the array: `new_array = array.copy()`
2. Reverses it: `new_array = reversed(new_array)`
3. Squares each element: `return [x * x for x in new_array]`

Given output: [1, 4, 1]

This output comes from squaring elements. Working backwards:
- 1 = x² means x could be 1 or -1
- 4 = x² means x could be 2 or -2  
- 1 = x² means x could be 1 or -1

So after reversal, the array could be [1, 2, 1], [-1, 2, 1], [1, 2, -1], or [-1, -2, -1], etc.

Now I need to find what the original array was before reversal.

If the reversed array is [1, 2, 1], then the original array (before reversal) was reverse([1, 2, 1]) = [1, 2, 1] (palindrome)

Let me verify:
- Input: [1, 2, 1]
- new_array = [1, 2, 1].copy() = [1, 2, 1]
- new_array = reversed([1, 2, 1]) creates an iterator that yields: 1, 2, 1
- [x * x for x in new_array] = [1*1, 2*2, 1*1] = [1, 4, 1] ✓

This matches the output!
