[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output "3 8 7 4" to determine which code path was taken and what the input must be.

The code has four possible outputs:
1. `anti + m, b, c + m, d` (if anti == c)
2. `anti, b + l, c, d + l` (if b == d)
3. `-1` (if l != m)
4. `anti, d, c, b` (else case)

The output is "3 8 7 4", not "-1", so we can rule out condition 3.

Let me test the else case: `print(anti, d, c, b)`
If the output is "3 8 7 4", this would mean:
- anti = 3
- d = 8
- c = 7
- b = 4

Let me verify this satisfies the else condition (i.e., doesn't satisfy the first two conditions):
- anti == c? → 3 == 7? → False ✓
- b == d? → 4 == 8? → False ✓
- Now calculate l and m:
  - l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4
  - m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4
- l != m? → 4 != 4? → False ✓

So all conditions failed, and we reach the else block, which prints: `anti, d, c, b` = `3, 8, 7, 4` ✓

Therefore, the input must be: "3 4 7 8"
