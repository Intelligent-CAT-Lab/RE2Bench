[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given output.

The code:
1. Reads an integer from input: `x = int(input())`
2. Checks if `x == 1`
3. If true, prints `0`
4. If false, prints `1`

Given that the output is `0`, I need to determine what value of `x` would produce this output.

Working backwards:
- The output is `0`
- Looking at the code, `0` is only printed when the condition `if x == 1:` is true
- For this condition to be true, `x` must equal `1`
- Since `x = int(input())`, the input must be convertible to the integer `1`
- Therefore, the input must be `"1"`

Verification: If input is "1", then x = int("1") = 1, and since 1 == 1 is True, the code prints 0. ✓
