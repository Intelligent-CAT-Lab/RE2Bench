[THOUGHT]
I need to work backwards from the output "AbCdEfG" to find what ciphertext and key would produce this when decrypted.

The `vigenere_decipher` function performs decryption using:
- For each alphabetic character: `decrypted_char = (ciphertext_char - shift) % 26`
- Where shift comes from the key, cycling through it

The simplest case would be a key that produces shift = 0, meaning the decryption doesn't change the characters - just preserves their case.

If key = "a", then:
- shift = ord('a') - ord('a') = 0
- This will cycle through key_index positions but always use 'a', giving shift = 0 every time

With ciphertext = "AbCdEfG" and key = "a" (shift = 0):

For each character:
- 'A': (0 - 0) % 26 = 0 → 'a', uppercase preserved → 'A' ✓
- 'b': (1 - 0) % 26 = 1 → 'b', lowercase preserved → 'b' ✓  
- 'C': (2 - 0) % 26 = 2 → 'c', uppercase preserved → 'C' ✓
- 'd': (3 - 0) % 26 = 3 → 'd', lowercase preserved → 'd' ✓
- 'E': (4 - 0) % 26 = 4 → 'e', uppercase preserved → 'E' ✓
- 'f': (5 - 0) % 26 = 5 → 'f', lowercase preserved → 'f' ✓
- 'G': (6 - 0) % 26 = 6 → 'g', uppercase preserved → 'G' ✓

Result: "AbCdEfG" ✓
