[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `is_prime` function to determine what values produce `true` as output.

The function logic:
1. If `n < 2`, return `False`
2. Loop through values `k` from 2 to `n - 2` (since `range(2, n-1)` excludes `n-1`)
3. If any `k` divides `n` evenly (i.e., `n % k == 0`), return `False`
4. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, return `True`

For the output to be `true` (boolean True), `n` must be a prime number.

Let me verify with n = 2:
- Is `2 < 2`? No, so don't return False
- `for k in range(2, 2-1)` = `range(2, 1)` → This is an empty range
- The loop doesn't execute
- return `True` ✓

Let me verify with n = 5 as another example:
- Is `5 < 2`? No
- `for k in range(2, 4)` → k takes values: 2, 3
  - `k = 2`: `5 % 2 = 1` (not 0, continue)
  - `k = 3`: `5 % 3 = 2` (not 0, continue)
- Loop completes without returning False
- return `True` ✓

Any prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) will return True. The smallest and simplest prime is 2.
