Let me trace through the `_cmp_name` function to determine what inputs would produce output `1`.

The function compares two types (x and y) and returns:
- 0 if their names are equal
- -1 if y is not a subclass of Basic
- Otherwise: `(i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2)` where i1 and i2 are indices in ordering_of_classes

For output to be 1, we need: `(i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2) = 1`

This occurs when `i1 > i2` is True (and `i1 < i2` is False), which happens in these scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** Both i1 and i2 are valid indices with i1 > i2
- Requires knowing ordering_of_classes

**Scenario 2:** Both are UNKNOWN (not in ordering_of_classes) and n1 > n2 lexicographically  
- `(n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2) = 1 - 0 = 1` ✓
- Requires: x.__name__ > y.__name__ and y is subclass of Basic

**Scenario 3:** x's name unknown (i1=UNKNOWN), y's name found (i2 < UNKNOWN)
- `(UNKNOWN > i2) - (UNKNOWN < i2) = 1 - 0 = 1` ✓  
- Since UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1, any found index is less than UNKNOWN
- This works regardless of whether x's name is lexicographically larger

I'll use Scenario 3 as it's most robust:
- x: A type with __name__ = "Zebra" (not in ordering_of_classes, so i1 = UNKNOWN)
- y: A type with __name__ = "Add" (must be subclass of Basic; assume it's a sympy class)

If "Add" is in ordering_of_classes:
- i2 = some index < UNKNOWN
- Return: `(UNKNOWN > i2) - (UNKNOWN < i2) = 1 - 0 = 1` ✓

If "Add" is also not found:
- Both UNKNOWN, and "Zebra" > "Add" lexicographically  
- Return: `(True) - (False) = 1` ✓

Either way, this works!
