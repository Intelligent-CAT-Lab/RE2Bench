[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. The code calls `input()` to get a string
2. It applies `.replace(',', ' ')` which replaces all commas with spaces
3. It prints the result

Given output: "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"

To work backwards:
- The output has two spaces separating three words: "avrnc", "fwujpcm", "ggjmc"
- The replace operation converted commas to spaces
- Therefore, the input must have had commas in the positions where the output has spaces

So the input must be: "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"

Let me verify:
- Input: "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
- After `.replace(',', ' ')`: "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" ✓ (matches output)

    "input": "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
