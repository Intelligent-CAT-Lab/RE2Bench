[THOUGHT]
To find the input that produces the output `["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]`, I need to work backwards from the result of `re.split(pattern, text)`.

The output structure tells me:
- 4 elements total, which means 3 separator occurrences
- Empty strings at start and end indicate the text begins and ends with the separator
- The middle elements have spaces preserved: `" abiguygusu "` and `" kjgufwycs "`
- This means the separators are NOT spaces (spaces are part of the kept content)

So the original text must be structured as:
`[SEPARATOR][space]abiguygusu[space][SEPARATOR][space]kjgufwycs[space][SEPARATOR]`

When split by the separator, we get the four parts shown.

For a RegexUtils class, a regex pattern separator makes sense. The most common and useful pattern would be `\d+` (one or more digits).

Let me verify:
```python
import re
text = "1 abiguygusu 1 kjgufwycs 1"
result = re.split(r'\d+', text)
# Result: ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']  ✓
```

This matches perfectly! The text starts with `1`, ends with `1`, and has `1` between the two words, separating them while keeping the surrounding spaces intact.
