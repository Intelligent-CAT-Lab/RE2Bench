Let me trace through the `select` method with the given output.

Output: "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"

Breaking down the code execution:
1. The output starts with "SELECT *" which means `fields` parameter was `None` (defaulted to '*' on line: `if fields is None: fields = '*'`)
2. After "FROM" we see "table1", which is `self.table_name`
3. We have "WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20" which comes from the condition parameter
4. The output ends with ";" which is added by `return sql + ';'`

Tracing through:
- If condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20" and it's not None, then: `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
- table_name = "table1"
- fields = None (not provided as argument, so uses default)

Verifying:
- fields is None → fields = '*'
- sql = f'SELECT {*} FROM table1' = "SELECT * FROM table1"
- condition is not None → sql += f' WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'
- return "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20" + ';' ✓

The structure indicates:
- args is empty (fields not passed as positional argument)
- condition is passed as kwarg
