The function `car_race_collision(n)` returns `n ** 2` (n squared).

Given the output is `9`, I need to find which value of `n` when squared produces 9.

Solving the equation: n² = 9
This gives us: n = 3 or n = -3

Both values would produce the same output. However, without additional context suggesting a negative value, the most straightforward answer is the positive value.

Let me verify: 3² = 9 ✓

Therefore, n = 3.
