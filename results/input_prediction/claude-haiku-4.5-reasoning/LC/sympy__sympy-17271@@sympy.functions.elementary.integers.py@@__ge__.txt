# THOUGHT

Looking at the output `"ceiling(x) >= x"`, I need to understand what input would produce this result.

The `__ge__` method on the `ceiling` class is:
```python
def __ge__(self, other):
    if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real:
        return S.true
    if other is S.NegativeInfinity and self.is_real:
        return S.true
    return Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)
```

For the output to be `"ceiling(x) >= x"` (the string representation of a `Ge` object):
- The first condition would return `S.true` (not matching)
- The second condition would return `S.true` (not matching)  
- Therefore, it returns `Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)` on the last line

This means:
1. `self` must be `ceiling(x)` - a ceiling function applied to a symbol x
2. `other` must be `x` - the symbol itself (not identical to self.args[0] or not real, so first condition fails)

When `Ge(ceiling(x), x, evaluate=False)` is converted to a string, it produces `"ceiling(x) >= x"`.

For the input representation, `other` should be a Symbol with name 'x'. In JSON format, this would reasonably be represented as:
- Either just `"x"` (the minimal representation)
- Or `{"name": "x"}` (the object-like representation)
- Or `{"type": "Symbol", "name": "x"}` (explicit type)

Given the pattern of the template where `nargs` is shown simply as `{}`, I'll use a similarly minimal but clear representation for the Symbol.

# INPUT

```json
{
    "self": {
        "nargs": {}
    },
    "args": {
        "other": {
            "type": "Symbol",
            "name": "x"
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
