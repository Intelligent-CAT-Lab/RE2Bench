Input to _hstack method is Xs = [0], where 0 is a single integer.

Looking at the loop on line 453:
- List comprehension: [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
  - Iterates over Xs = [0]
  - For each f in Xs:
    - Check if sparse.issparse(f): 0 is not a sparse matrix, so this is False
    - Therefore, the expression becomes: f (which is 0)

So the resulting list is [0].

Therefore, the state of f is [0], and the state of Xs is [[0]] (since Xs is the input list being iterated over).

[ANSWER]
453             Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]## [STATE]f=[0][/STATE] [STATE]Xs=[[0]][/STATE]
