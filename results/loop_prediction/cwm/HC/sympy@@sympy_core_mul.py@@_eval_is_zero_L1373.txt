Step 1: Understand the input
The method `_eval_is_zero` is being called with `self` being `"pi/2"`.

Step 2: Identify the loop
The relevant loop for this problem is in the method `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`, which iterates over `self.args` with variable `a`.

Step 3: Determine the states of `a` and `self.args`
- `self` is `"pi/2"`, which is an instance of the `Mul` class.
- The `args` attribute of `self` would be a tuple containing the components of `"pi/2"`, which are likely `pi` and `2` (though the exact representation might depend on the implementation of the `Mul` class and its `_args_type`).
- Therefore, `self.args` would be a tuple like `(pi, 2)`.
- The loop variable `a` would take the values `pi` and `2` in each iteration.

Step 4: Conclude the states
- `a` will be `[pi, 2]`.
- `self.args` will be `[(pi, 2), (pi, 2)]`.
