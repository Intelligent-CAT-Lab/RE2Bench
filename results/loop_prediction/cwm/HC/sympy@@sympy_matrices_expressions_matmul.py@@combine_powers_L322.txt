We need to predict the states of the variable `i` in the `for` loop on line 13 of the code.

The code is inside the `combine_powers` function, which takes an argument `mul`. The input given is `X*Z`.

Given that `mul` is `X*Z`, let's analyze the code to determine the possible states of `i`.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(args)`, where `args` is an attribute of `mul`. Since `mul` is `X*Z`, we can infer that `args` will have a length of 2, as it represents the factors of the multiplication.

The loop starts from 1 and goes up to, but not including, `len(args)`. Therefore, the range will be from 1 to 2 (exclusive), meaning the loop will run only once, with `i` being equal to 1.

Now, let's reason about why the loop would only run once. The loop is designed to combine powers of matrices. In this case, since `X` and `Z` are not powers of the same matrix base, the loop will not combine them and will simply append `Z` to `new_args` after checking the conditions.

So, the possible states of `i` are [1], as the loop will only iterate once.

We also need to determine the states of `range(1, len(args))`. Since `len(args)` is 2, the range will be [1, 2), which means the only value in the range is 1. However, in terms of the loop's execution, we are more interested in the value of `i` that the loop will take, which is 1.

Therefore, the state of `i` is [1], and the state of `range(1, len(args))` is [1].
