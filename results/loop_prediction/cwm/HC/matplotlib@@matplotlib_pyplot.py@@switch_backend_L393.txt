Let's analyze the given code snippet for the `switch_backend` function.

The code provided is a part of the function `switch_backend` which is responsible for switching the backend of matplotlib. 

We're given that `newbackend = "Agg"`. 

Our goal is to identify the states of the variable `func_name` and the list `["new_figure_manager", "draw_if_interactive", "show"]` in the for loop on line 123.

1. The loop iterates over the list `["new_figure_manager", "draw_if_interactive", "show"]`.
2. On each iteration, the variable `func_name` takes the value of the current element from the list.
3. Since the list has three elements, `func_name` will take each of these values in order.

Therefore, the states of `func_name` and the list will be:
- `func_name = "new_figure_manager"`
- `func_name = "draw_if_interactive"`
- `func_name = "show"`

And the list remains the same throughout the loop:
- `["new_figure_manager", "draw_if_interactive", "show"]`

So, the loop annotation will be:
