Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The input to the method `unique_labels` is `ys = ["[0, 1]"]`. This means that `ys` is a list containing a single string element `"[0, 1]"`. 

The method starts by calling `attach_unique(*ys, return_tuple=True)`, which will return a tuple containing the unique labels for each element in `ys`. Since `ys` contains a single string, `ys` becomes `["[0, 1]"]`.

Next, it checks the type of each element in `ys` using `type_of_target(x) for x in ys`. Here, `x` will be the string `"[0, 1]"`, and `type_of_target(x)` will return `"unknown"` because the string does not represent a valid label type. 

Then, it checks if all elements in `ys` have the same type. Since there is only one element, this check passes.

The method then determines the label type, which in this case is `"unknown"`.

It then checks if the label type is `"multilabel-indicator"` and if all elements in `ys` have the same number of labels. Since the label type is `"unknown"`, this check is skipped.

The method then calls `_FN_UNIQUE_LABELS.get(label_type, None)` to get the function to extract unique labels for the given label type. Since the label type is `"unknown"`, this will return `None`.

The method then checks if `_unique_labels` is `None`. Since it is, the method raises a `ValueError` with the message `"Unknown label type: %s" % repr(ys)`.

So, the final output will be a `ValueError` with the message `"Unknown label type: ['[0, 1]']"`.
