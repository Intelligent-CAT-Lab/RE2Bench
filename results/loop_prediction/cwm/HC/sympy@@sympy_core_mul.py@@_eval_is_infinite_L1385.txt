Input: `self = "pi/2"`

- `self` is an instance of `Mul` (a class that represents multiplication).
- `self.args` would be a tuple containing the operands involved in the multiplication.
- Assuming `self.args` is `("pi", "/2")` (since "pi/2" is split into two parts by the `/` operator).

Now tracing through the `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` method:

- `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` are initialized to `False`.
- Loop through each element `a` in `self.args`:
  - First iteration (`a = "pi"`):
    - `a.is_zero` is likely `None` (since pi is not zero).
    - `a.is_infinite` is also likely `None` (since pi is finite).
    - Since `seen_zero` is `False` and `a.is_zero` is `None`, set `seen_zero` to `None`.
    - Similarly, since `seen_infinite` is `False` and `a.is_infinite` is `None`, set `seen_infinite` to `None`.
  - Second iteration (`a = "/2"`):
    - This is likely a `Mul` instance with arguments `(Div, 2)`.
    - `a.is_zero` would be `False` (since dividing by 2 doesn't make it zero).
    - `a.is_infinite` would also be `False` (since dividing by a finite number doesn't result in infinity).
    - `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite` remain `None` as they were set in the previous iteration.

The method returns `(seen_zero, seen_infinite) = (None, None)`.

Then in `_eval_is_infinite`:
- `seen_infinite` is `None`, so the function returns `None`.
