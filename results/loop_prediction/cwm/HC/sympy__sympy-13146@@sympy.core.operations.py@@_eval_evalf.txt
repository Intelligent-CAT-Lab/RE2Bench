This question requires reasoning about Python code and variable states in loops. 

First, identify the loop in question: it's the `for a in self.args` loop on line 80. The variables are `a` (the loop variable) and `args` (which gets appended to in the loop body). 

Since `self.args` is a sequence (e.g. a tuple or list), we need to determine the values that `a` will take during each iteration. However, without knowing the actual value of `self.args`, we can't give specific values for `a`. 

Instead, we can represent the possible states as lists where the length of the list corresponds to the number of iterations. For `a`, this would be a list containing all elements of `self.args`. For `args`, this would be a list of lists where each sublist contains the elements added to `args` up to that point in the loop.

However, the actual values of `self.args` are not provided, so we cannot give a more specific answer. 

But since the question asks for the state of variables associated with LOOPS, we can assume that `self.args` is a list or tuple and provide a general answer.

Let's assume `self.args` is a list containing three elements: `[x, y, z]`. Then, the states would be:

- `a`: `[x, y, z]`
- `args`: `[[x], [x, y], [x, y, z]]`

But since we don't know the actual values of `self.args`, we can't provide a more specific answer. 

However, the question asks for the state of variables associated with LOOPS. So, we can represent the states as lists with the same length as the number of iterations.

Let's assume `self.args` has `n` elements. Then, the states would be:

- `a`: `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` where `a_i` is the `i-th` element of `self.args`
- `args`: `[[a_1], [a_1, a_2], ..., [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]]`

But since we don't know the actual values of `self.args`, we can't provide a more specific answer.

In the given code, `self.args` is not defined, so we can't provide a specific answer. However, we can provide a general answer.

[ANSWER]
79         args = []
80         for a in self.args: ## [STATE]a=[None, None, None][/STATE] [STATE]args=[[], [None], [None, None]][/STATE]
