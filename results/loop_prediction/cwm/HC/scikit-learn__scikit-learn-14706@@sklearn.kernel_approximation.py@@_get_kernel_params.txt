In the _get_kernel_params function, the kernel is 'polynomial'. KERNEL_PARAMS['polynomial'] is a list of parameters used by the polynomial kernel, which is ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree'].

The function iterates over KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel] = ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree'].

For each 'param' in this list:
- If self.gamma is not None, it is added to the params dictionary.
- If self.coef0 is not None, it is added to the params dictionary.
- If self.degree is not None, it is added to the params dictionary.

In this case, self.gamma is None, self.coef0 is 0.1, and self.degree is 3.1. Therefore, 'gamma' is not added to the params dictionary, but 'coef0' and 'degree' are added.

So, the states of 'param' are ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree'], and the state of (KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]) is ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree'].
