We are given a code snippet of a `LogLocator` class, which is used to calculate tick locations for log scales in plots. The `tick_values` method takes in `vmin` and `vmax` as arguments and returns an array of tick locations.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The method first checks if `numticks` is set to 'auto'. If it is, it determines the number of ticks based on the axis's tick space. If not, it uses the provided `numticks` value.
2. It then checks if `vmin` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it raises an error because log scales require positive values.
3. The method calculates the logarithm of `vmin` and `vmax` with base `b` (which is 10.0 in this case).
4. It calculates the number of decades (`numdec`) between `vmin` and `vmax`.
5. If `self._subs` is a string, it determines the subs tick values based on the base `b`. If `self._subs` is not a string, it uses the provided subs tick values.
6. The method calculates the stride, which is the number of decades to step between each tick location.
7. It then calculates the decade start values (`decades`) using the stride.
8. If `have_subs` is True, it calculates the tick locations by multiplying the subs tick values with the decade start values. If `stride` is greater than 1, it returns an empty array.
9. If `have_subs` is False, it calculates the tick locations by raising the base `b` to the power of the decade start values.

Now, let's analyze the given input:

- `vmin` = 6
- `vmax` = 150
- `self._base` = 10.0
- `self._subs` = [1.]
- `numticks` = 3

The logarithm of `vmin` and `vmax` with base 10 is approximately 0.778 and 2.176, respectively. The number of decades (`numdec`) is 1.

Since `self._subs` is not a string, it uses the provided subs tick values, which is [1.]. The stride is calculated as 1.

The decade start values (`decades`) are calculated as np.arange(math.floor(log_vmin) - stride, math.ceil(log_vmax) + 2 * stride, stride), which results in np.arange(0 - 1, 3 + 2 * 1, 1) = np.arange(-1, 5, 1) = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Since `have_subs` is False, the tick locations are calculated by raising the base `b` to the power of the decade start values, which results in 10 ** [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4] = [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000].

However, the tick locations are filtered to only include values between `vmin` and `vmax`, which results in [10, 100].

Therefore, the output of the `tick_values` method is [10, 100].
