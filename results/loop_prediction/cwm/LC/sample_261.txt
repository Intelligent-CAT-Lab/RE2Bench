Let's break down the problem step by step.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` and `target`. The list `nums` contains integers, and `target` is an integer. The goal of the function is to separate the numbers in `nums` into two lists: `lows` for numbers less than `target`, and `higgs` for numbers greater than or equal to `target`.

Given the input:
`nums = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]`
`target = 5`

Let's trace the loop iteration by iteration.

1. Initialization:
   - `lows = []`
   - `higgs = []`
   - `nums = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]`
   - `target = 5`

2. First iteration (i = 12):
   - 12 is greater than or equal to 5, so it goes to `higgs`.
   - `lows = []`
   - `higgs = [12]`

3. Second iteration (i = 516):
   - 516 is greater than or equal to 5, so it goes to `higgs`.
   - `lows = []`
   - `higgs = [12, 516]`

4. Third iteration (i = 5):
   - 5 is greater than or equal to 5, so it goes to `higgs`.
   - `lows = []`
   - `higgs = [12, 516, 5]`

5. Fourth iteration (i = 2):
   - 2 is less than 5, so it goes to `lows`.
   - `lows = [2]`
   - `higgs = [12, 516, 5]`

6. Fifth iteration (i = 3):
   - 3 is less than 5, so it goes to `lows`.
   - `lows = [2, 3]`
   - `higgs = [12, 516, 5]`

7. Sixth iteration (i = 214):
   - 214 is greater than or equal to 5, so it goes to `higgs`.
   - `lows = [2, 3]`
   - `higgs = [12, 516, 5, 214]`

8. Seventh iteration (i = 51):
   - 51 is greater than or equal to 5, so it goes to `higgs`.
   - `lows = [2, 3]`
   - `higgs = [12, 516, 5, 214, 51]`

After the loop, `lows.clear()` is called, which empties the `lows` list. The function then returns `lows` and `higgs`.

Now, let's determine the states of `i` and `nums` during the loop iterations:

- `i` takes the values: 12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51 (in that order)
- `nums` remains the same throughout the loop: [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]

Therefore, the states are:
`i = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]`
`nums = [[12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]]`
