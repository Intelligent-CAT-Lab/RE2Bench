Let's analyze the code step by step. The function `change_base(x, base)` converts a number `x` from base 10 to another base specified by `base`. 

The input values are `x = 4` and `base = 5`. 

The loop starts at line 4: `while x > 0:`
- Initially, `x = 4` which is greater than 0, so the loop body executes.
- Inside the loop, `ret` is updated to `str(x % base) + ret`. Since `x = 4` and `base = 5`, `x % base = 4`, so `ret` becomes `"4"`.
- Then, `x //= base` updates `x` to `4 // 5 = 0`.
- The loop condition is checked again with `x = 0`, which is not greater than 0, so the loop terminates.

Therefore, the variable `x` takes the value 4 in the first iteration and then the loop ends. The `ret` variable is not marked for state tracking, so we only need to track `x`.
