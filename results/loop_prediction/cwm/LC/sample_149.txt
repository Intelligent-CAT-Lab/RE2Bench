Let's break down the code and the input to determine the states of the variables in the loop.

The function `f` takes two parameters: `tuple_list` and `joint`. The `tuple_list` is a list of integers, and `joint` is a string (in this case, a comma). The function iterates over each number in `tuple_list` and performs some string manipulation.

First, let's look at the input:
- `tuple_list` = [32332, 23543, 132323, 33300]
- `joint` = ","

Now, let's analyze the loop step by step:

1. **First iteration**:
   - `num` = 32332
   - `str(num)` = "32332" (length is 5)
   - `joint * len(str(num))` = "," * 5 = ",,,,,"
   - `dict.fromkeys(str(num), joint * len(str(num)))` creates a dictionary with keys from "32332" and values ",,,,,"
   - `.popitem()[0]` gets the last key-value pair's key, which is "2" (since dictionaries in Python 3.7+ are insertion-ordered, and the last character is "2")
   - `string` becomes "" + "2" + "," = "2,"

2. **Second iteration**:
   - `num` = 23543
   - `str(num)` = "23543" (length is 5)
   - `joint * len(str(num))` = "," * 5 = ",,,,,"
   - Similar to the first iteration, `.popitem()[0]` gets the last character, which is "3"
   - `string` becomes "2," + "3" + "," = "2,3,"

3. **Third iteration**:
   - `num` = 132323
   - `str(num)` = "132323" (length is 6)
   - `joint * len(str(num))` = "," * 6 = ",,,,,,"
   - `.popitem()[0]` gets the last character, which is "3"
   - `string` becomes "2,3," + "3" + "," = "2,3,3,"

4. **Fourth iteration**:
   - `num` = 33300
   - `str(num)` = "33300" (length is 5)
   - `joint * len(str(num))` = "," * 5 = ",,,,,"
   - `.popitem()[0]` gets the last character, which is "0"
   - `string` becomes "2,3,3," + "0" + "," = "2,3,3,0,"

So, the states of the variables in the loop are:
- `num` takes the values 32332, 23543, 132323, 33300 in each iteration.
- `tuple_list` remains the same throughout the loop: [32332, 23543, 132323, 33300]
