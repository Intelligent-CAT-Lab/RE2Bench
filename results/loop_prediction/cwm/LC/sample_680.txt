`text` is the string "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324". The loop iterates over the range of the length of the string, which is 29. So, `i` will take values from 0 to 28.

For each `i`, the code checks if the character at position `i` in `text` is alphanumeric. If it is, it adds that character to `letters`. 

Let's list the characters that are alphanumeric:
- 'w' (position 0)
- 'e' (position 1)
- '@' (not alphanumeric, position 2)
- '3' (position 3)
- '2' (position 4)
- 'r' (position 5)
- '7' (position 6)
- '1' (position 7)
- 'g' (position 8)
- '7' (position 9)
- '2' (position 10)
- 'u' (position 11)
- 'g' (position 12)
- '9' (position 13)
- '4' (position 14)
- '=' (not alphanumeric, position 15)
- '(' (not alphanumeric, position 16)
- '8' (position 17)
- '2' (position 18)
- '3' (position 19)
- '6' (position 20)
- '5' (position 21)
- '8' (position 22)
- '*' (not alphanumeric, position 23)
- '!' (not alphanumeric, position 24)
- '@' (not alphanumeric, position 25)
- '3' (position 26)
- '2' (position 27)
- '4' (position 28)

So, the alphanumeric characters are: 'w', 'e', '3', '2', 'r', '7', '1', 'g', '7', '2', 'u', 'g', '9', '4', '8', '2', '3', '6', '5', '8', '3', '2', '4'.

Now, let's consider the states of `i` and `range(len(text))`. Since `range(len(text))` is a range object that generates numbers from 0 to 28, it stays the same for every iteration. 

For `i`, it changes with each iteration, taking the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 28.
