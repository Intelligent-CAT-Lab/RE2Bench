Let's break down the code step by step to determine the states of the variables.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` and `target`. The variable `nums` is a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3]`, and `target` is the number `4`.

The function initializes a variable `count` to `0`.

The outer loop iterates over each element `n1` in the list `nums`. For each iteration of `n1`, the inner loop iterates over each element `n2` in the list `nums`.

In the inner loop, the code checks if the sum of `n1` and `n2` equals `target`. If it does, it increments the `count` by `1`.

Let's go through each iteration:

1. Outer loop: `n1` = 1
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 1 (sum = 2, not equal to 4)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 2 (sum = 3, not equal to 4)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 3 (sum = 4, equal to 4, count += 1)

2. Outer loop: `n1` = 2
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 1 (sum = 3, not equal to 4)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 2 (sum = 4, equal to 4, count += 1)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 3 (sum = 5, not equal to 4)

3. Outer loop: `n1` = 3
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 1 (sum = 4, equal to 4, count += 1)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 2 (sum = 5, not equal to 4)
   - Inner loop: `n2` = 3 (sum = 6, not equal to 4)

So, the states of the variables are:

- `n1`: [1, 2, 3]
- `nums`: [1, 2, 3] (stays the same for all iterations)
- `n2`: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

However, since we are only interested in the states for each loop iteration, we need to combine the states of `n1` and `n2` accordingly.

The states of `n1` and `n2` for each loop iteration are:
- First iteration of outer loop: `n1` = 1, `n2` = 1, 2, 3
- Second iteration of outer loop: `n1` = 2, `n2` = 1, 2, 3
- Third iteration of outer loop: `n1` = 3, `n2` = 1, 2, 3

Now, let's put these into the correct format.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, target):
2     count = 0
3     for n1 in nums:## [STATE]n1=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         for n2 in nums:## [STATE]n2=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
5             count += (n1+n2==target)
6     return count
