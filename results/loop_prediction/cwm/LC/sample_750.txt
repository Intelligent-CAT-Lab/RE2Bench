The `char_map` is an empty dictionary `{}`, and the `text` is the string "hbd". Let's go through the loop step by step.

1. First iteration:
   - `ch` will be 'h' (the first character of "hbd").
   - `text` remains the same, "hbd".

2. Second iteration:
   - `ch` will be 'b' (the second character of "hbd").
   - `text` remains the same, "hbd".

3. Third iteration:
   - `ch` will be 'd' (the third character of "hbd").
   - `text` remains the same, "hbd".

Since `char_map` is empty, `val` will be `None` for all iterations, and `new_text` will be built by adding each character as is.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(char_map, text):
2     new_text = ''
3     for ch in text:## [STATE]ch=["h", "b", "d"][/STATE] [STATE]text=[["h", "b", "d"], ["h", "b", "d"], ["h", "b", "d"]][/STATE]
4         val = char_map.get(ch)
5         if val is None:
6             new_text += ch
7         else:
8             new_text += val
9     return new_text
