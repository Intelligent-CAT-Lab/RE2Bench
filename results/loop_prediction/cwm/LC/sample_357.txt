To determine the states of the variables in the loop, let's first understand the code and then trace it step by step.

The function `f(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that is the reverse of `s`. It does this by iterating over the indices of `s` in reverse order and appending each character to a list `r`, which is then joined into a string.

Given the input `s = "crew"`, the length of `s` is 4. The loop iterates over the range `range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1)`, which is `range(3, -1, -1)`. This range generates the indices 3, 2, 1, and 0.

Now, let's trace the loop step by step:

1. On the first iteration, `i = 3`, and `s[i] = 'w'`. So, `r` becomes `['w']`.
2. On the second iteration, `i = 2`, and `s[i] = 'e'`. So, `r` becomes `['w', 'e']`.
3. On the third iteration, `i = 1`, and `s[i] = 'r'`. So, `r` becomes `['w', 'e', 'r']`.
4. On the fourth iteration, `i = 0`, and `s[i] = 'c'`. So, `r` becomes `['w', 'e', 'r', 'c']`.

The variable `range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1)` is a single value that generates the sequence of indices. However, since we are tracing the loop, we are interested in the values of `i` during each iteration.

Therefore, the states of the variables are:

- `i` takes the values `[3, 2, 1, 0]` in each iteration.
- `range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1)` is a single value that generates the sequence `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, but since it's not changing during the loop, we can consider it as a list with the same value repeated for each iteration.
