The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `separator`. The `text` is split into lines using the `splitlines()` method, which splits the string at line breaks. Given the input `text = "dga nqdk\rull qcha kl"`, the `splitlines()` method will split it into two lines: `["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"]`. 

Since `separator` is `1` (which is truthy in Python), the function proceeds to the `return` statement on line 4. This statement uses a list comprehension to iterate over each line `s` in `splitted`. For each line `s`, it joins the words with a space using `' '.join(s)`. However, since each line is already a string of words separated by spaces, joining them with a space again doesn't change the string. 

So, the list comprehension will iterate over `splitted` which is `["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"]`. The variable `s` will take the value of each string in `splitted` in turn. Therefore, `s` will be `"dga nqdk"` in the first iteration and `"ull qcha kl"` in the second iteration. 

The variable `splitted` remains the same throughout the list comprehension, so its state will be repeated for each iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, separator):
2     splitted = text.splitlines()
3     if separator:
4         return [' '.join(s) for s in splitted]## [STATE]s=[["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"], ["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"]][/STATE] [STATE]splitted=[["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"], ["dga nqdk", "ull qcha kl"]][/STATE]
5     else:
6         return splitted
