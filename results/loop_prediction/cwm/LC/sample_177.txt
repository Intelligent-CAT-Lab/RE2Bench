The input to the function `f` is the string "Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#". 

First, the input string is converted to a list of characters. Then, the function iterates over the indices of this list using a for loop. For each index `i`, if `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 == 1`), the character at that index is converted to its opposite case (uppercase to lowercase or vice versa) using the `swapcase()` method. Finally, the modified list of characters is joined back into a string and returned.

Let's break down the loop iterations:

1. `i = 0`: Since 0 is even, no change is made to the character at index 0.
2. `i = 1`: Since 1 is odd, the character at index 1 is swapped.
3. `i = 2`: Since 2 is even, no change is made to the character at index 2.
4. `i = 3`: Since 3 is odd, the character at index 3 is swapped.
5. This pattern continues until all indices have been processed.

The string "Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#" has the following characters (with their indices):
0: H
1: e
2: y
3: (space)
4: D
5: U
6: d
7: E
8: (space)
9: T
10: H
11: i
12: s
13: (space)
14: $
15: n
16: d
17: ^
18: (space)
19: &
20: *
21: &
22: t
23: h
24: i
25: s
26: @
27: #

The characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27) will be swapped:
- e -> E
- (space) -> (space, no change since space is not a letter)
- U -> u
- E -> e
- T -> t
- i -> I
- (space) -> (space, no change)
- n -> N
- ^ -> ^ (no change since ^ is not a letter)
- & -> & (no change since & is not a letter)
- & -> & (no change since & is not a letter)
- h -> H
- s -> S
- @ -> @ (no change since @ is not a letter)
- # -> # (no change since # is not a letter)

So, the modified string will be "HEy dUdE tHiS $nD^ &*&tHIS@#".

Now, let's determine the states of the variables in the loop:

- `i` will take on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 27.
- `range(len(text))` will be the range from 0 to 27 (since the length of the string is 28).

Therefore, the states of the variables in the loop are:
