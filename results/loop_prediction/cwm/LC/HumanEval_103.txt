I need to determine the values of the variables `i` and `range(n, m+1)` inside the for loop on line 6 of the given Python code.

First, let's understand the parameters passed to the function `rounded_avg`. The input is `n = 185` and `m = 546`.

Line 6 is a for loop that iterates over `range(n, m+1)`. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` (inclusive) up to `m+1` (exclusive). So, `range(n, m+1)` will generate numbers from 185 to 546, inclusive.

The variable `i` takes on each value in this range, one at a time, during each iteration of the loop.

Now, let's calculate the values of `i` and `range(n, m+1)` for each iteration.

The length of the range is `m - n + 1 = 546 - 185 + 1 = 362`. Therefore, the loop will run 362 times.

For `i`, the values will start at 185 and increment by 1 until they reach 546. So, `i` will take the values 185, 186, 187, ..., 546.

For `range(n, m+1)`, since this is the same range object in every iteration, its value remains the same throughout the loop. It's the range object that generates the sequence from 185 to 546.

Therefore, the states of the variables are:

- `i` = [185, 186, 187, ..., 546] (a list of 362 numbers)
- `range(n, m+1)` = [range(185, 547)] (the same range object repeated 362 times, but since range objects are immutable, it's technically the same object each time)

Now, let's format this into the required output.

3     if m < n:
4         return -1
5     summation = 0
6     for i in range(n, m+1):## [STATE]i=[185, 186, 187, ..., 546][/STATE] [STATE]range(n, m+1)=[range(185, 547), range(185, 547), ..., range(185, 547)] (362 times)[/STATE]
7         summation += i
8     return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
