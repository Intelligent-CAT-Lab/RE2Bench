To determine the states of variables `i` and `ls` in the given Python code snippet, let's break down the execution step by step.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `ls` (a list of lists) and `n` (an integer). The loop iterates over each sublist `i` in `ls`. For each iteration, we check if the first element of `i` is equal to `n`. If it is, we update the `answer` variable to be the current sublist `i`.

Given the input:
- `ls` is a list containing three sublists: `[1, 9, 4]`, `[83, 0, 5]`, and `[9, 6, 100]`.
- `n` is `1`.

Let's analyze the loop:

1. First iteration: `i` is `[1, 9, 4]`. The first element `i[0]` is `1`, which equals `n`. So, `answer` becomes `[1, 9, 4]`.
2. Second iteration: `i` is `[83, 0, 5]`. The first element `i[0]` is `83`, which does not equal `n`. `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.
3. Third iteration: `i` is `[9, 6, 100]`. The first element `i[0]` is `9`, which does not equal `n`. `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.

Since `ls` is a list that does not change during the loop, its state remains the same in all iterations.

Now, let's determine the states for `i` and `ls`:

- `i` will take on the values of each sublist in `ls` in order: `[1, 9, 4]`, `[83, 0, 5]`, `[9, 6, 100]`.
- `ls` remains the same throughout the loop: `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.

Therefore, the states are:

- `i`: `[1, 9, 4]`, `[83, 0, 5]`, `[9, 6, 100]`
- `ls`: `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` for all iterations
