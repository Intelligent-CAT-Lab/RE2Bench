The function `f` takes an array as input and performs the following operations:
1. Copies the input array to a new list called `result`.
2. Reverses the `result` list.
3. Multiplies each element in the reversed `result` list by 2 using a list comprehension.

Let's break down the states of the variables step by step:

1. `array` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2. `result` is initialized as a copy of `array`, so `result` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
3. `result.reverse()` reverses the list in place, so `result` becomes [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
4. The list comprehension `[item * 2 for item in result]` iterates over each `item` in the reversed `result` list and multiplies it by 2. 

The variable `item` will take the values 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in each iteration of the list comprehension. The `result` list will be updated to [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] after the list comprehension.

Since the list comprehension is a single line, the states of `item` and `result` will be the same for each iteration. Therefore, the states will be:

- `item` = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- `result` = [[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]
