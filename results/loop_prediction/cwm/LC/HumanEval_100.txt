The input to the method is `n = 3`. The code uses a list comprehension to generate a list where each element is calculated as `n + 2*i` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. 

First, we need to determine the values of `i` and `range(n)` during each iteration of the list comprehension. The `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, so for `n = 3`, it will be `[0, 1, 2]`. 

The variable `i` will take each value in this range during each iteration. Therefore, `i` will be `0`, `1`, and `2` in successive iterations.

Now, let's calculate the value of `n + 2*i` for each `i`:
- For `i = 0`, `n + 2*i = 3 + 2*0 = 3`.
- For `i = 1`, `n + 2*i = 3 + 2*1 = 5`.
- For `i = 2`, `n + 2*i = 3 + 2*2 = 7`.

So, the list comprehension will generate the list `[3, 5, 7]`.
