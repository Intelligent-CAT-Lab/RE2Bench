I need to determine the states of the variables `i` and `l` in the loop. Let's break down the code step by step.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `array` and `elem`. The initial values are:
- `array` = [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
- `elem` = 3

Line 2 initializes `k` to 0.
Line 3 creates a copy of `array` called `l`. So, `l` = [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

Now, the for loop starts. The loop variable `i` will take each element of `l` in order. The loop will iterate over each element of `l`, which is the same as `array` initially.

First iteration:
- `i` = 3 (the first element of `l`)
- `l` remains [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] because we're just iterating over it, not modifying it.

Since `i` (3) is not greater than `elem` (3), the condition `if i > elem` is false. So, we skip the if block and go to line 8, where `k` is incremented by 1. Now, `k` = 1.

Second iteration:
- `i` = 5 (the second element of `l`)
- `l` is still [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

Now, `i` (5) is greater than `elem` (3), so the condition is true. We enter the if block.

Line 6 inserts `elem` (3) at index `k` (1) in `array`. So, `array` becomes [3, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. Then, we break out of the loop.

Since we broke out of the loop after the second iteration, the loop only runs twice. Therefore, the states of `i` and `l` are as follows:

- `i` takes the values 3 and 5.
- `l` remains the same throughout the loop because we're not modifying it, just iterating over it. So, `l` is [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] for both iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
