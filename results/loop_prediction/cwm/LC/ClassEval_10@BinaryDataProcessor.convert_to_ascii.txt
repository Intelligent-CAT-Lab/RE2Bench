To determine the variable states for the given code and input, I need to trace through the code step by step.

The method `convert_to_ascii` starts by initializing a `byte_array` as an empty bytearray. Then, it enters a for loop that iterates over the `self.binary_string` in steps of 8 characters, since each ASCII character is represented by 8 bits.

Given the input `binary_string` is "01101000011001010110001001101111", the length of this string is 32 characters. 

The loop variable `i` will take the values 0, 8, 16, and 24, since these are the starting indices for each 8-bit segment in the binary string. 

For each value of `i`, the code extracts a substring of 8 characters starting at index `i`, converts this binary substring to a decimal number, and appends this decimal number to the `byte_array`.

Therefore, the variable states are:

- `i` will be [0, 8, 16, 24]
- `range(0, len(self.binary_string), 8)` will evaluate to the same list as it's a constant range object that generates these values.

10             byte = self.binary_string[i:(i + 8)]
11             decimal = int(byte, 2)
12             byte_array.append(decimal)
13         return byte_array.decode('ascii')
