To determine the states of variables in the loops, we need to follow the execution step by step.

The input to the method `f` is `ints = [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`.

First, `counts` is initialized as a list of 301 zeros. Then, the code iterates over each element `i` in `ints`. For each iteration, `counts[i]` is incremented by 1.

The first loop is:
4. for i in ints:## [STATE]i=??[/STATE] [STATE]ints=??[/STATE]

Since `ints` is `[2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`, the values of `i` will be the elements of this list in order. The variable `ints` remains the same throughout the loop. So, the state of `i` will be the elements of `ints`, and `ints` will be repeated for each iteration.

Next, the code iterates over the range of the length of `counts` (which is 301) and checks if `counts[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. If so, it appends the string representation of `i` to the list `r`. Since we are only interested in the states of variables in loops, we will focus on the second loop:
8. for i in range(len(counts)):

The variable `i` will take values from 0 to 300. However, since the only values in `counts` that are greater than or equal to 3 are at indices 2 (which is 3), the loop will append '2' to `r`.

Now, let's put it all together.

The state of `i` in the first loop will be the elements of `ints`, and `ints` will be repeated for each iteration. The state of `i` in the second loop will be the range from 0 to 300, but since we are only interested in the values where `counts[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, we can focus on the value 2.

Here is the annotated code:

5         counts[i] += 1

7     r = []
8     for i in range(len(counts)): ## [STATE]i=[range(0, 301)]/[/STATE]
9         if counts[i] >= 3:
10             r.append(str(i))
11     counts.clear()
12     return ' '.join(r)
