The function `f` is designed to find the position of the nth occurrence of a substring `substr` in the string `text`, counting from the end. The input values are `text = "zjegiymjc"`, `substr = "j"`, and `occ = 2`.

The code starts by initializing `n` to 0 (line 2), which will keep track of how many occurrences have been found. 

At line 3, we enter a while loop that will continue until the substring `substr` is no longer found in `text` (i.e., `i == -1`). In each iteration, we find the rightmost occurrence of `substr` in `text` using `text.rfind(substr)`.

The initial values are `text = "zjegiymjc"` and `substr = "j"`. The first `rfind` will return 7 because the last occurrence of "j" in "zjegiymjc" is at index 7.

Now, `n` is still 0, so we increment it to 1 and update `text` to be the substring of `text` up to index 7, which is "zjegiym". This effectively removes the last "j" from `text`.

In the next iteration of the while loop, `text` is now "zjegiym" and `substr` remains "j". `rfind` will find the next last occurrence of "j", which is at index 1. Since `n` is now 1 and `occ` is 2, we return `i`, which is 1.

So, tracing through the loop:
- First iteration: `i` = 7 (found at the end of "zjegiymjc"), `n` becomes 1, `text` becomes "zjegiym".
- Second iteration: `i` = 1 (found in "zjegiym"), since `n` equals `occ`, we return `i`.

Since the loop runs twice and the value of `True` in the while condition doesn't change, it stays the same through the iterations. However, the state of `text` changes as we modify it in each iteration.
