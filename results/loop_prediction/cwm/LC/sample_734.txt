The function `f` takes a list of numbers and iterates over it in reverse order, starting from the third last element. It checks if each number is even, and if so, removes it from the list. The loop variable `i` takes values starting from `len(nums) - 2` down to `0`. The range object is evaluated once before the loop starts, and its value remains constant throughout the loop.

Given the input `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`, the length of the list is 4. Therefore, `len(nums) - 2` is 2, and the range object is `range(2, -1, -1)`, which generates the sequence [2, 1, 0]. The loop variable `i` will take these values in order.

Now, let's analyze the loop iterations:

1. First iteration: `i = 2`. The number at index 2 is 3, which is odd, so it is not removed.
2. Second iteration: `i = 1`. The number at index 1 is 3, which is odd, so it is not removed.
3. Third iteration: `i = 0`. The number at index 0 is 5, which is odd, so it is not removed.

Since none of the numbers in the list are even, the list remains unchanged after the loop.

Therefore, the state of `i` is `[2, 1, 0]`, and the state of `range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)` is `[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]]`.

1 def f(nums):
2     for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[[2, 1, 0]][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)=[[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]]][/STATE]
3         if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
4             nums.remove(nums[i])
5     return nums
