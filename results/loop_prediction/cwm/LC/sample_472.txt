The function `f` processes a given `text` by counting the occurrence of each character, excluding hyphens and considering case insensitivity. The input is "x--y-z-5-C". 

First, `text.replace('-', '').lower()` converts the input to "xyz5c". The loop iterates over each character in this string:
- 'x', 'y', 'z', '5', 'c'. 

For each character, the dictionary `d` is updated to count occurrences. Since all characters are unique, each has a count of 1.

Next, the dictionary `d` is sorted by value (which is 1 for all entries) and then by key (since the values are the same, the sorting is by key). The sorted list of tuples will be [('5', 1), ('c', 1), ('x', 1), ('y', 1), ('z', 1)].

Finally, a list comprehension extracts the keys (characters) from the sorted list, resulting in ['5', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z'].
