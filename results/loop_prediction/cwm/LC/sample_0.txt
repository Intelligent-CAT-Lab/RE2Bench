The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` and processes it. Let's go step by step.

First, the input `nums` is `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`. The loop iterates over each element `n` in `nums`. For each `n`, we count how many times `n` appears in `nums` using `nums.count(n)`, then append a tuple of `(count, n)` to `output`. After processing all elements, we sort `output` in descending order and return it.

Let's track the variables:
- `nums` remains the same throughout: `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.
- `n` takes each value from `nums` in order: `1`, `1`, `3`, `1`, `3`, `1`.
- For each `n`, `output` grows by adding a tuple. The count for `1` is 4 (appears 4 times), and for `3` is 2 (appears 2 times). 

So the tuples added to `output` will be:
- `(4, 1)` added three times (for the three `1`s)
- `(2, 3)` added two times (for the two `3`s)

But since the loop processes each element, even if they are the same, the state of `n` and `nums` will repeat accordingly.
