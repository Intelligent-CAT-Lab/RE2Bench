<think>
The function `f` takes a string `text` and a substring `sub`, and it finds all the starting indices of `sub` in `text`. The loop iterates until `starting` becomes -1, which means no more occurrences of `sub` are found. 

Initially, `starting` is 0. The first occurrence of "good" in "egmdartoa" is not found, so `starting` becomes -1 after the first iteration. 

So the states of `starting` will be [0, -1].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0, -1][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
