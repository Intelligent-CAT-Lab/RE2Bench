Let's go step by step through the code and predict the states of the variables associated with LOOPS.

1. The input is "80 970", so `a` = 80 and `b` = 970.
2. `x` is initialized to `a`, so `x` = 80.
3. `h` is initialized to 0.
4. `s` is initialized to 0.

Now, let's analyze the while loops:

First while loop:
- The condition is `x > 0`, so the loop will run 80 times (since `x` starts at 80 and decreases by 1 in each iteration).
- In each iteration, `x` decreases by 1, `h` increases by 1, and `s` increases by 1.

So, the state of `x` in the first while loop is:
`[80, 79, 78, ..., 2, 1]`

Second while loop:
- The condition is `s // b != 0`, so the loop will run until `s` is less than `b`.
- In each iteration, `h` increases by 1, and `s` decreases by `b - 1`.

Since `s` starts at 80 and `b` is 970, the loop will not run at all (because 80 < 970).

Therefore, the state of `x` in the first while loop is the only one that needs to be annotated.

Here is the annotated code:

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 x = a
3 h = 0
4 s = 0
5 while x > 0 :## [STATE]['x']=[[80, 79, 78, ..., 2, 1]][/STATE]
6     x -= 1
7     h += 1
8     s += 1
9 while s // b != 0 :
10     h += 1
11     s = s - b + 1
12 print ( h )
