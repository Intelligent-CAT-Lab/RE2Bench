Let's think this through step by step.

1. The first line reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. In this case, the input is "1 1", so `x` becomes `["1", "1"]`.
2. The for loop iterates over the indices of the list `x`, which has length 2. So the loop variable `i` will take the values 0 and 1.
3. Inside the loop, the string at index `i` in `x` is converted to an integer. So after the loop, `x` will be `[1, 1]`.
4. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `x`, respectively, so both `a` and `b` will be 1.
5. The minimum value in `x` is printed, which is 1.
6. The difference between `a` and `b` is 0, which is less than 2, so 0 is printed.

Now let's annotate the code with the variable states.

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[range(0, 2), range(0, 2)][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
