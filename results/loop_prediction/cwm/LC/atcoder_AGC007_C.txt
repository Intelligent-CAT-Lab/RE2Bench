To determine the states of the variables in the loop, let's analyze the given code step by step.

First, the input values are read and converted to Decimal type:
- `n = 199996`
- `d = 95`
- `x = 12`

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 199996` (inclusive). In each iteration, `i` is converted to a Decimal, and the expression `(int(n) - int(i) + 1)` is calculated. This expression simplifies to `(199996 - i + 1)`.

However, the key point is that the loop iterates over a range of integers from 1 to 199996. The variable `i` takes on each integer value in this range sequentially. Therefore, the state of `i` in each iteration is simply the current integer value.

The range object `range(1, int(n) + 1)` is evaluated once before the loop starts. Since `n = 199996`, this range is `range(1, 199997)`, which includes all integers from 1 to 199996.

Thus, the state of `i` in each iteration is a list of integers from 1 to 199996, and the state of `range(1, int(n) + 1)` is a list containing the same range object repeated for each iteration (though in practice, the range object is not modified and remains the same throughout the loop).

[ANSWER]
1 from decimal import Decimal , getcontext
2 getcontext ( ) . prec = 200
3 n , d , x = map ( Decimal , input ( ) . split ( ) )
4 ans = 0
5 for i in range ( 1 , int ( n ) + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, ..., 199996][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , int ( n ) + 1 )=[range(1, 199997), range(1, 199997), ..., range(1, 199997)] (199996 times)[/STATE]
6     i = Decimal ( str ( i ) )
7     ans += Decimal ( str ( ( int ( n ) - int ( i ) + 1 ) ) ) / Decimal ( str ( i ) ) * ( d + x * Decimal ( str ( int ( n ) * 2 - 1 ) ) / Decimal ( "2" ) )
8 print ( ans )
