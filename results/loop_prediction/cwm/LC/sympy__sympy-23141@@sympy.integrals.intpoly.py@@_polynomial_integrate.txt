Let's analyze the given function and the input.

The function `_polynomial_integrate` takes three arguments: `polynomials`, `facets`, and `hp_params`. The `polynomials` argument is a dictionary where keys are string representations of integers (representing polynomial degrees) and values are the corresponding polynomial expressions. The `facets` and `hp_params` arguments are not used in this particular call.

Given the input:
```python
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "polynomials": {
            "2": "x*y"
        },
        "facets": null,
        "hp_params": null
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
We can see that `polynomials` is `{"2": "x*y"}`, which means the loop variable `deg` will iterate over the keys of this dictionary. Since there's only one key, `"2"`, the loop will run once with `deg` being `"2"`.

Now, let's look at the loop:
```python
for deg in polynomials:## [STATE]deg=??[/STATE] [STATE]polynomials=??[/STATE]
```
The variable `deg` will take the value `"2"` (as a string) because that's the only key in the `polynomials` dictionary. The `polynomials` variable will be `{"2": "x*y"}` throughout the loop since it's not modified inside the loop.

However, we should note that in the context of the function, `deg` is expected to be an integer representing the degree of a polynomial. But since the keys in the `polynomials` dictionary are strings, `deg` will be a string. This might cause issues later in the function if it's used as an integer.

Therefore, the states of the variables in the loop are:
- `deg`: `["2"]` (a list containing the string `"2"`)
- `polynomials`: `[{"2": "x*y"}]` (a list containing the dictionary `{"2": "x*y"}`)
