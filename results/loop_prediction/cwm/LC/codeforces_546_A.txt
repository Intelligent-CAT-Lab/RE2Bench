Let's analyze the given code step by step.

The input values are k=1, n=1, and w=1. 

The code starts by calculating `sum` as 0. 

Then, there's a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive). Since w=1, the loop runs once with i=1.

Inside the loop, `sum` is updated by adding k*i (1*1=1) to it, making `sum` equal to 1.

After the loop, the code checks if `sum` is less than or equal to n (1 <= 1), which is true. Therefore, it prints 0.

So, the variable states during the loop are:
- i: [1]
- range(1, w+1): [range(1, 2)]

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[[1]][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[range(1, 2)]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
[/ANSWER]
