The function `f` takes an argument `n`, which is 1 in this case. Let's step through the code:

1. `n` is 1, so `n%2 == 1` is true, so we execute line 4: `p += 'sn'`. Now `p` is 'sn'.
2. The loop `for x in range(1, n+1)` will run for `x` values from 1 to 1 (inclusive), since `n` is 1.
   - The first (and only) iteration: `x` is 1. Since `x%2 == 0` is false (1 is odd), we execute line 11: `p += 'ts'`. Now `p` is 'snts'.
3. After the loop, the function returns `p`, which is now 'snts'.

Now, let's annotate the code with the variable states:

- In the for loop, `x` takes the value 1.
- The range `range(1, n+1)` is equivalent to `range(1, 2)`, which generates the sequence [1].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1:
4         p+='sn'
5     else:
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):## [STATE]x=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range(1, n+1)=[[1]][/STATE]
8         if x%2 == 0:
9             p+='to'
10         else:
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
