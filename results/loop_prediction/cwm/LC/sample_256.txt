To solve this problem, I'll start by analyzing the given Python code and input.

The code defines a function `f` that takes two parameters: `text` and `sub`. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and the length of `text` minus 1, respectively. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

Inside the loop, it calculates a middle index `c` using integer division of `a` and `b`. It checks if the last occurrence of `sub` in `text` is greater than or equal to `c`. If this condition is true, it increments `a` by 1; otherwise, it decrements `b` by 1.

The loop continues until `a` is greater than `b`, at which point the function returns the value of `a`.

Given the input `text = "dorfunctions"` and `sub = "2"`, let's determine the variable states step by step.

1. Initialization:
   - `a = 0`
   - `b = len("dorfunctions") - 1 = 11`

2. First iteration of the while loop:
   - `c = (0 + 11) // 2 = 5`
   - `text.rfind("2")` returns `-1` because "2" is not found in "dorfunctions".
   - Since `-1 < 5`, the else clause is executed: `b = 5 - 1 = 4`

3. Second iteration of the while loop:
   - `c = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`
   - `text.rfind("2")` still returns `-1`.
   - Since `-1 < 2`, the else clause is executed: `b = 2 - 1 = 1`

4. Third iteration of the while loop:
   - `c = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `text.rfind("2")` still returns `-1`.
   - Since `-1 < 0`, the else clause is executed: `b = 0 - 1 = -1`

Now, `a = 0` and `b = -1`, so the loop condition `a <= b` is false, and the loop exits.

Therefore, the states of `a` and `b` throughout the loop are:
- `a` starts at 0 and remains 0 until the loop ends.
- `b` starts at 11, then becomes 4, then 1, and finally -1.

The loop runs 3 times, and in each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are:
1. `a = 0`, `b = 11`
2. `a = 0`, `b = 4`
3. `a = 0`, `b = 1`
4. `a = 0`, `b = -1` (loop exits here)

So, the states for `a` and `b` in the loop are:
- `a = [0, 0, 0]`
- `b = [11, 4, 1]`

Now, I'll replace the "??"" in the code with these states.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, sub):
2     a = 0
3     b = len(text) - 1
4 
5     while a <= b:## [STATE]a=[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]][/STATE] [STATE]b=[[11, 4, 1], [11, 4, 1], [11, 4, 1]][/STATE]
6         c = (a + b) // 2
7         if text.rfind(sub) >= c:
8             a = c + 1
9         else:
10             b = c - 1
11 
12     return a
