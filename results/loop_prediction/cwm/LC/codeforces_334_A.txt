The input is 8, so `n` will be 8. The loop condition is `i < j`. Let's step through the loop:

Initial state: `i = 1`, `j = n * n = 64`. `i < j` is True.

First iteration:
- `print(i, j)` prints 1 and 64.
- `i` becomes 2, `j` becomes 63. `i < j` is True.

Second iteration:
- `print(i, j)` prints 2 and 63.
- `i` becomes 3, `j` becomes 62. `i < j` is True.

...

Last iteration before loop exit:
- `i` will be 32, `j` will be 33. `i < j` is True.
- `print(i, j)` prints 32 and 33.
- `i` becomes 33, `j` becomes 32. `i < j` is False.

The loop exits when `i = 33` and `j = 32`. So the condition `i < j` will be True for the first 32 iterations (since the loop runs until `i` is no longer less than `j`).
