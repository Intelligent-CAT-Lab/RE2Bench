Let's analyze the code step by step to determine the states of the variables `e` and `l`.

The function `below_threshold` takes a list `l` and an integer `t` as arguments. It iterates over each element `e` in the list `l`. The loop will break and return `False` if any element `e` is greater than or equal to `t`. If the loop completes without breaking, it returns `True`.

Given the input, `l` is `[1, 8, 4, 10]` and `t` is `10`.

1. First iteration: `e` is `1` (the first element of `l`). Since `1` is not greater than or equal to `10`, the loop continues.
2. Second iteration: `e` is `8`. Again, `8` is not greater than or equal to `10`, so the loop continues.
3. Third iteration: `e` is `4`. `4` is also not greater than or equal to `10`, so the loop continues.
4. Fourth iteration: `e` is `10`. Here, `10` is equal to `t`, so the condition `e >= t` is met. The function immediately returns `False`.

Therefore, the variable states in the loop are as follows:
- For each iteration, `e` takes the values `[1, 8, 4, 10]`.
- `l` remains unchanged throughout the loop, always being `[1, 8, 4, 10]`.
