I need to figure out the states of the variables `c` and `str(n)` in the loop. The input is `n = 1`. 

First, let's convert `n` to a string. Since `n` is 1, `str(n)` is the string "1". 

The loop iterates over each character in `str(n)`, so the loop will run once with `c` being the character '1'. 

In the first (and only) iteration:
- `c` is '1'.
- `str(n)` remains "1" for the entire loop since it's not changing.

So, the states should reflect this. Since there's only one iteration, the lists for `c` and `str(n)` will each have one element.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[["1"]][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
