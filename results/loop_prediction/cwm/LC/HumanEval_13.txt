The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD is the largest number that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. The algorithm used here is the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient for calculating GCD.

Let's analyze the execution step by step:

1. **Initial Call**:
   - `a` = 10
   - `b` = 15

2. **First Iteration of the While Loop**:
   - The loop condition is `while b:`. Since `b` = 15 (which is non-zero), the loop body executes.
   - Inside the loop: `a, b = b, a % b`
     - `a % b` is `10 % 15`, which equals 10.
     - So, `a` becomes 15, and `b` becomes 10.
   - After this iteration, `a` = 15, `b` = 10.

3. **Second Iteration of the While Loop**:
   - The loop condition is checked again. `b` = 10 (non-zero), so the loop continues.
   - Inside the loop: `a, b = b, a % b`
     - `a % b` is `15 % 10`, which equals 5.
     - So, `a` becomes 10, and `b` becomes 5.
   - After this iteration, `a` = 10, `b` = 5.

4. **Third Iteration of the While Loop**:
   - The loop condition is checked again. `b` = 5 (non-zero), so the loop continues.
   - Inside the loop: `a, b = b, a % b`
     - `a % b` is `10 % 5`, which equals 0.
     - So, `a` becomes 5, and `b` becomes 0.
   - After this iteration, `a` = 5, `b` = 0.

5. **Termination of the While Loop**:
   - The loop condition is checked again. Now, `b` = 0, so the loop exits.

6. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `a`, which is 5.

Therefore, the value of `b` during each iteration of the while loop is `[15, 10, 5]`.
