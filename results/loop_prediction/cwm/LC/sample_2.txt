<think>
The loop iterates over each character in the string '+'. Since '+' has only one character, the loop will run once. 

In the first iteration, `i` will be '+'. The code checks if '+' is in `new_text`, which is the list of characters from the input string "hbtofdeiequ". Since '+' is not in "hbtofdeiequ", the `if` condition is false, and the code does not remove anything from `new_text`.

Therefore, the state of `i` is ['+'].

1 def f(text):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     for i in '+':## [STATE]i=["+"][/STATE]
4         if i in new_text:
5             new_text.remove(i)
6     return ''.join(new_text)
