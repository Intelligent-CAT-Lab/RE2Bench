The input to the method `f` is the string "3". Let's go through the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes a string as input.
2. Since the string is not empty and its first character is numeric, it proceeds to the next line.
3. The variable `cur` is initialized to 0.
4. The for loop iterates over the range of the length of the string. Since the string is "3", its length is 1, so the range is [0].
5. In the first iteration of the loop, `i` is 0. The value of `cur` is updated to `cur * 10 + int(string[i])`, which is `0 * 10 + int("3") = 3`.

So, the states of the variables are:

- `i` is [0] because the loop runs once with `i` being 0.
- `range(len(string))` is [0] because the length of the string is 1, and the range function generates a sequence from 0 to 0.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string):
2     if not string or not string[0].isnumeric:
3         return 'INVALID'
4     cur = 0
5     for i in range(len(string)):## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(string))=[[0]][/STATE]
6         cur = cur * 10 + int(string[i])
7     return str(cur)
