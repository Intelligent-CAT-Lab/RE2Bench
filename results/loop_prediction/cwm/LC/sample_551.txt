Let's break down the problem step by step. The input to the method `f` is a dictionary called `data`, which contains three keys: "inf", "a", and "d". Each of these keys maps to a list of values. The function's purpose is to iterate through each item in `data`, then through each member in the list associated with that item, and collect all unique members into a list called `members`. Finally, it returns the sorted list of unique members.

The function starts by initializing an empty list called `members`. Then it enters a loop over each `item` in `data`. The first `item` is "inf", and the corresponding value is ["a", "b"]. The code then loops over each `member` in this list.

First iteration:
- `item` = "inf"
- `data` remains the same throughout the function
- `member` = "a" (first element of ["a", "b"])
- Since "a" is not in `members` (which is initially empty), it gets appended to `members`.

Second iteration:
- `member` = "b" (second element of ["a", "b"])
- Since "b" is not in `members` (which now contains ["a"]), it gets appended to `members`.

Now, the outer loop moves to the next `item`, which is "a". The corresponding value is ["inf", "c"].

Third iteration:
- `item` = "a"
- `member` = "inf" (first element of ["inf", "c"])
- Since "inf" is not in `members` (which now contains ["a", "b"]), it gets appended to `members`.

Fourth iteration:
- `member` = "c" (second element of ["inf", "c"])
- Since "c" is not in `members` (which now contains ["a", "b", "inf"]), it gets appended to `members`.

Now, the outer loop moves to the next `item`, which is "d". The corresponding value is ["inf"].

Fifth iteration:
- `item` = "d"
- `member` = "inf" (only element of ["inf"])
- Since "inf" is already in `members` (which now contains ["a", "b", "inf", "c"]), it is not appended again.

After processing all items and members, the `members` list contains ["a", "b", "inf", "c"], and the function returns this list sorted, which is ["a", "b", "c", "inf"].
