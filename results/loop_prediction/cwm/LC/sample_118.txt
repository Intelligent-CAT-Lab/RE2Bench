The function f takes two arguments: text and chars. The loop iterates over the range of num_applies (which is 2). Let's break down the iterations:

1st iteration:
- i = 0
- range(num_applies) = range(0, 2) which includes 0 and 1
- extra_chars becomes 'mk'
- text is updated by replacing 'mk' with an empty string. Since 'mk' is not in the original text "zbzquiuqnmfkx", text remains the same.

2nd iteration:
- i = 1
- range(num_applies) still includes 0 and 1
- extra_chars becomes 'mkmk'
- text is updated by replacing 'mkmk' with an empty string. Again, 'mkmk' is not in the text, so text remains unchanged.

So, the states of the variables are as follows:

1 def f(text, chars):
2     num_applies = 2
3     extra_chars = ''
4     for i in range(num_applies):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(num_applies)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
5         extra_chars += chars
6         text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
7     return text
