Let's trace the code step by step to determine the states of the variables `i` and `enumerate(numbers)` in the for loop.

1. The input to the method `f` is `numbers = [11, 3]`.
2. The for loop iterates over the enumerated version of `numbers`, which gives both the index `i` and the value at that index.
3. In the first iteration, `i = 0` and the value is `11`.
4. In the second iteration, `i = 1` and the value is `3`.

Since the loop runs twice (once for each element in `numbers`), the states of `i` will be `[0, 1]`. 

The `enumerate(numbers)` function returns an iterator that produces tuples containing a count (from the start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over the sequence (`numbers`). Therefore, the states of `enumerate(numbers)` will be `[(0, 11), (1, 3)]`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(numbers):
2     new_numbers = []
3     for i, _ in enumerate(numbers):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]enumerate(numbers)=[[(0, 11), (1, 3)], [(0, 11), (1, 3)]][/STATE]
4         new_numbers.append(numbers[len(numbers)-1-i])
5     return new_numbers
