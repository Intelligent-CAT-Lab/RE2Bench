Let's break down the code step by step. The input to the function `f` is the string ",wPzPppdl/". The function iterates over each character in this string, swapping the case of each character (uppercase becomes lowercase and vice versa).

1. The loop variable `i` will take on the values from 0 to 10 (since the length of the string is 11). 
2. The range object `range(len(text))` will generate these indices.
3. For each index `i`, we check if the character at that index is uppercase. If it is, we convert it to lowercase and add it to `out`. Otherwise, we convert it to uppercase and add it to `out`.

Now, let's determine the states of the variables in the loop:

- `i` will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in each iteration respectively.
- `range(len(text))` will be a range object that generates these indices, so its state will be the same in each iteration, but we need to represent it as a list of the indices it will generate.

Therefore, the states of the variables are:

- `i` = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- `range(len(text))` = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], ...] (repeated 11 times)
