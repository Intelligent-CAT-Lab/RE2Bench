[THOUGHT]
Split the input txt "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8" on '\n' gives two elements: "#[)[]>[^e>" and " 8".
The for-loop iterates twice:
- 1st iteration: line = "#[)[]>[^e>"
- 2nd iteration: line = " 8"
The variable lines remains the same list across iterations and is ["#[)[]>[^e>", " 8"] for each iteration (repeated twice).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(txt, marker):
2     a = []
3     lines = txt.split('\n')
4     for line in lines:## [STATE]line=["#[)[]>[^e>", " 8"][/STATE] [STATE]lines=[["#[)[]>[^e>", " 8"], ["#[)[]>[^e>", " 8"]][/STATE]
5         a.append(line.center(marker))
6     return '\n'.join(a)
