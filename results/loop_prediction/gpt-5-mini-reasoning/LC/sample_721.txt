[THOUGHT]
len(nums) = 5, so count = 5. range(2, count) = range(2,5) which yields the sequence [2, 3, 4], so the loop iterates three times with num = 2, then 3, then 4. The iterable expanded ([2,3,4]) stays the same for each iteration, so repeat it three times to show its state per iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     count = len(nums)
3     for num in range(2, count):## [STATE]num=[2, 3, 4][/STATE] [STATE]range(2, count)=[[2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]][/STATE]
4         nums.sort()
5     return nums
