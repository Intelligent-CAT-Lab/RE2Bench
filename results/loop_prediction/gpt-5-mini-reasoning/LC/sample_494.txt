[THOUGHT]
Initial values: num = "1", l = 3. len(num) = 1.
Loop condition l > len(num) is true while l = 3 and while l = 2; it becomes false when l decrements to 1.
Thus there are 2 iterations.
l at the start of each iteration: 3, then 2.
num remains "1" through both iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
