[THOUGHT]
s = "crew" has length 4. The range call is range(3, -1, -1) which produces the sequence [3, 2, 1, 0]. The loop iterates four times with i taking values 3, 2, 1, 0 in that order. The range object (the sequence) remains the same across iterations, so it's shown repeated for each iteration.

1 def f(s):
2     r = []
3     for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1):## [STATE]i=[3, 2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1)=[[3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         r += s[i]
5     return ''.join(r)
