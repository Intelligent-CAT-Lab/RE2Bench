[THOUGHT]
text = "USaR" (length 4). index starts at 1.
Loop iterations while index < 4:
- Iteration 1: index = 1. Compare text[1] = 'S' to text[0] = 'U' -> not equal -> index becomes 2.
- Iteration 2: index = 2. Compare text[2] = 'a' to text[1] = 'S' -> not equal -> index becomes 3.
- Iteration 3: index = 3. Compare text[3] = 'R' to text[2] = 'a' -> not equal -> index becomes 4.
Loop exits because index == 4. So index values during loop: [1, 2, 3]. text remains "USaR" unchanged across each iteration, represented as a list of its characters repeated per iteration.

1 def f(text):
2     index = 1
3     while index < len(text):## [STATE]index=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]text=[["U", "S", "a", "R"], ["U", "S", "a", "R"], ["U", "S", "a", "R"]][/STATE]
4         if text[index] != text[index - 1]:
5             index += 1
6         else:
7             text1 = text[:index]
8             text2 = text[index:].swapcase()
9             return text1 + text2
10     return text.swapcase()
