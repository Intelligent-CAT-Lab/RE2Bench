[THOUGHT]
num_applies = 2 so range(num_applies) yields two iterations with i = 0 then i = 1.
During iteration 1 (i=0): extra_chars starts as '' and becomes '' + chars = 'mk'. text.replace('mk','') finds no 'mk' in "zbzquiuqnmfkx", so text remains unchanged.
During iteration 2 (i=1): extra_chars becomes 'mk' + 'mk' = 'mkmk'. text.replace('mkmk','') finds no 'mkmk', so text remains unchanged.
The iterable range(num_applies) itself is [0, 1], and that same iterable is present for each of the two iterations.

1 def f(text, chars):
2     num_applies = 2
3     extra_chars = ''
4     for i in range(num_applies):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(num_applies)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
5         extra_chars += chars
6         text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
7     return text
