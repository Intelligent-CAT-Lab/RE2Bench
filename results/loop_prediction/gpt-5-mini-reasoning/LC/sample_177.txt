[THOUGHT]
The input string is converted to a list of characters of length 28:
['H','e','y',' ','D','U','d','E',' ','T','H','i','s',' ','$','n','d','^',' ','&','*','&','t','h','i','s','@','#']
So the loop for i in range(len(text)) iterates i = 0,1,...,27 (28 iterations). The range(len(text)) value (the sequence 0..27) stays the same for each iteration, so it's the same list repeated 28 times.
