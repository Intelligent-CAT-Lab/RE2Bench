[THOUGHT]
We iterate over the 5 strings in items in order. For each iteration, text takes that string value. The whole items list remains the same across iterations (so we repeat it 5 times). I also checked text.rfind(pattern) for each text with pattern " B ":
- " bBb " -> no " B " (space-B-space) present -> -1
- " BaB " -> no " B " present -> -1
- " bB"  -> no trailing space after B -> -1
- " bBbB " -> no B with spaces on both sides -> -1
- " bbb" -> no uppercase B -> -1
So pos is always -1 and result stays empty, but only text and items states are requested.

1 def f(pattern, items):
2     result = []
3     for text in items:## [STATE]text=[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"][/STATE] [STATE]items=[[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"]][/STATE]
4         pos = text.rfind(pattern)
5         if pos >= 0:
6             result.append(pos)
7 
8     return result
