[THOUGHT]
aDict is {"1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3}. aDict.items() yields the sequence of (key, value) tuples in insertion order: ("1", 1), ("2", 2), ("3", 3). The list comprehension iterates over these three tuples, so v takes those three tuple values in order. aDict.items() remains the same view/sequence for each of the three iterations, so it is shown repeated three times (once per iteration).
