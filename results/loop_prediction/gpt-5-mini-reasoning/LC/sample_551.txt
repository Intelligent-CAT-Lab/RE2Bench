[THOUGHT]
We iterate over the dict keys in insertion order: "inf", then "a", then "d".

Outer loop (item):
- Iteration 1: item = "inf", data stays the whole dict.
  Inner loop over data["inf"] = ["a", "b"]:
    - member = "a" -> members becomes ["a"]
    - member = "b" -> members becomes ["a","b"]
- Iteration 2: item = "a", data unchanged.
  Inner loop over data["a"] = ["inf", "c"]:
    - member = "inf" -> members becomes ["a","b","inf"]
    - member = "c" -> members becomes ["a","b","inf","c"]
- Iteration 3: item = "d", data unchanged.
  Inner loop over data["d"] = ["inf"]:
    - member = "inf" -> already in members, no change.

So the sequence of item values is ["inf", "a", "d"].
The sequence of member values as the inner loop executes overall is ["a", "b", "inf", "c", "inf"].
For each outer iteration, data is the same dict repeated three times.
For each inner iteration, data[item] is the corresponding list repeated for each member iteration:
- first two inner iterations: ["a", "b"]
- next two: ["inf", "c"]
- last one: ["inf"]

6                 members.append(member)
7     return sorted(members)
