r, D, x are parsed from input "2 100 105": r = 2, D = 100, initial x = 105.
The loop runs for i in range(10), so i takes values 0 through 9.
Each iteration updates x = 2*x - 100. Tracing x:
- i=0: x = 2*105 - 100 = 110
- i=1: x = 2*110 - 100 = 120
- i=2: x = 2*120 - 100 = 140
- i=3: x = 2*140 - 100 = 180
- i=4: x = 2*180 - 100 = 260
- i=5: x = 2*260 - 100 = 420
- i=6: x = 2*420 - 100 = 740
- i=7: x = 2*740 - 100 = 1380
- i=8: x = 2*1380 - 100 = 2660
- i=9: x = 2*2660 - 100 = 5220

The variable i sequence is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The iterable range(10) can be represented as the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]; this same iterable is present (unchanged) for each of the 10 iterations, so it is repeated 10 times in the state annotation.
