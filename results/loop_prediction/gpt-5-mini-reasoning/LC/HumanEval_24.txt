[THOUGHT]
range(3) produces [0, 1, 2]. reversed(range(3)) produces the sequence 2, 1, 0. The loop will iterate i = 2, then i = 1, and at i = 1 the function returns (so the iteration for i = 0 is not reached). Therefore i's states are [2, 1]. The iterable reversed(range(n)) is the same full sequence each iteration; since there are 2 iterations, represent it repeated twice: [[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]].

2 
3     for i in reversed(range(n)):## [STATE]i=[2, 1][/STATE][STATE]reversed(range(n))=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         if n % i == 0:
5             return i
