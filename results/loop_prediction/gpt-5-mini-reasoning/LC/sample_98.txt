[THOUGHT]
The input string is "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!". s.split() splits on whitespace into tokens: ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"]. The list comprehension iterates over these 6 tokens, so the loop variable s takes those values in order. The iterable s.split() is the same list for each of the 6 iterations, so it is repeated 6 times in its state listing.

1 def f(s):
2     return sum([s.istitle() for s in s.split()])## [STATE]s=["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"][/STATE] [STATE]s.split()=[["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"]][/STATE]
