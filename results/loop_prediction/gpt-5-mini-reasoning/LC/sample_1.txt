[THOUGHT]
The function is called with a = [1], b = [1], c = [1, 2].
The for loop iterates over the tuple (a, b, c), so there are 3 iterations:
- Iteration 1: d is a -> [1]
- Iteration 2: d is b -> [1]
- Iteration 3: d is c -> [1, 2]

The variables a, b, c do not change during the loop; their values remain the same on each of the 3 iterations. Therefore:
- d states across iterations: [[1], [1], [1, 2]]
- (a, b, c) states across iterations: [[ [1], [1], [1, 2] ], [ [1], [1], [1, 2] ], [ [1], [1], [1, 2] ]]

3     for d in a, b, c:## [STATE]d=[[1], [1], [1, 2]][/STATE] [STATE]a, b, c=[[[1], [1], [1, 2]], [[1], [1], [1, 2]], [[1], [1], [1, 2]]][/STATE]
4         result.update(dict.fromkeys(d))
5     return result
