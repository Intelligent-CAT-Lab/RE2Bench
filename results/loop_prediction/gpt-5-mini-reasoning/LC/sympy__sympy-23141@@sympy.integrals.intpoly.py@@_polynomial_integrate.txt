[THOUGHT]
polynomials is the dict {"2": "x*y"} — iterating over a dict yields its keys. There is a single key "2", so the outer for-loop runs exactly once with deg = "2". The polynomials object remains the same across the iteration, so its state is repeated once. (Note: hp_params is None in the input; attempting to execute the inner loop "for hp in hp_params" would raise a TypeError at runtime, but the outer loop's iteration sequence is still deg = "2".)
