[THOUGHT]
text = "dorfunctions" has length 12, so b starts as 11. sub = "2" is not in text, so text.rfind(sub) == -1. In the loop c = (a+b)//2 each iteration and since -1 >= c is always false for nonnegative c, the else branch runs every time setting b = c - 1. Trace:
- Iteration 1: a=0, b=11 -> c=5 -> else -> b=4
- Iteration 2: a=0, b=4  -> c=2 -> else -> b=1
- Iteration 3: a=0, b=1  -> c=0 -> else -> b=-1
Loop stops because a(0) > b(-1). So the loop ran 3 iterations; a was 0 each time, b was 11, then 4, then 1 at the start of each iteration.

1 def f(text, sub):
2     a = 0
3     b = len(text) - 1
4 
5     while a <= b:## [STATE]a=[0, 0, 0][/STATE] [STATE]b=[11, 4, 1][/STATE]
6         c = (a + b) // 2
7         if text.rfind(sub) >= c:
8             a = c + 1
9         else:
10             b = c - 1
11 
12     return a
