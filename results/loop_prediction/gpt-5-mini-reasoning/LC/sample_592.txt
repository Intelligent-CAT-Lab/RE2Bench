[THOUGHT]
The input list numbers is [11, 3]. enumerate(numbers) yields the pairs (0, 11) then (1, 3), so the loop runs twice. The loop variable i takes values 0 then 1. Following the example's style, the iterable's state (enumerate(numbers)) is shown as the full list of enumerated pairs repeated for each iteration. While running, new_numbers is built as follows: for i=0 append numbers[1] -> 3; for i=1 append numbers[0] -> 11. So i = [0, 1] and enumerate(numbers) = [[(0, 11), (1, 3)], [(0, 11), (1, 3)]] across the two iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(numbers):
2     new_numbers = []
3     for i, _ in enumerate(numbers):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]enumerate(numbers)=[[(0, 11), (1, 3)], [(0, 11), (1, 3)]][/STATE]
4         new_numbers.append(numbers[len(numbers)-1-i])
5     return new_numbers
