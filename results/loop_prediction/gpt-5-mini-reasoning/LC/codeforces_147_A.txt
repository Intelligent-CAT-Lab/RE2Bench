[THOUGHT]
t is the string ',.?!'. The for-loop iterates over each character in t in order:
i = ','
i = '.'
i = '?'
i = '!'
t itself doesn't change during the loop, so its state is the same for each of the 4 iterations (represented as the list of characters repeated 4 times).

[ANSWER]
1 s = input ( )
2 t = ',.?!'
3 for i in t : s = s . replace ( i , i + ' ' )## [STATE]i=["", ",", ".", "?", "!"][/STATE] [STATE]t=[ [",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"] ][/STATE]
4 s =  ' ' . join ( s . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
5 for i in t : s = s . replace ( ' ' + i , i )
6 print (s)
