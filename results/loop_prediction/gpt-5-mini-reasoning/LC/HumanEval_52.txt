[THOUGHT]
The list l is [1, 8, 4, 10]. The for-loop iterates over these elements in order.
- e = 1 (1 < t -> continue)
- e = 8 (8 < t -> continue)
- e = 4 (4 < t -> continue)
- e = 10 (10 >= t -> return False and loop exits)

The loop runs 4 iterations (the fourth causes the return). l remains the same throughout; include its full value repeated for each iteration.
