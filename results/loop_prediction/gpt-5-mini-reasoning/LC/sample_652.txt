[THOUGHT]
The input string is "3", so len(string) == 1. range(len(string)) produces a single value: 0.
The for-loop will run exactly once with i = 0.
Represent i's states across iterations as [0].
Represent the iterable's sequence as [0], and repeated per iteration as [[0]] (one inner list per iteration) following the example's format.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string):
2     if not string or not string[0].isnumeric:
3         return 'INVALID'
4     cur = 0
5     for i in range(len(string)):## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(string))=[[0]][/STATE]
6         cur = cur * 10 + int(string[i])
7     return str(cur)
