[THOUGHT]
n is the integer 1. str(n) is the string "1", so the loop iterates once over the single character '1'.
- c takes the value "1" for that single iteration: c = ["1"].
- str(n) as a sequence of characters is ["1"], and since it remains the same for each of the 1 iterations, we repeat it once: str(n) = [["1"]].
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[["1"]][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
