[THOUGHT]
The dict preserves insertion order. marks.values() yields values in the order given: [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]. The loop iterates 6 times, so value takes those values in sequence. marks.values() (the iterable) remains the same list view on each iteration, so represent it repeated for each of the 6 iterations.

1 def f(marks):
2     highest = 0
3     lowest = 100
4     for value in marks.values():## [STATE]value=[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83][/STATE] [STATE]marks.values()=[[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]][/STATE]
5         if value > highest:
6             highest = value
7         if value < lowest:
8             lowest = value
9     return highest, lowest
