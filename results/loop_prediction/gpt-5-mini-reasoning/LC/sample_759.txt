[THOUGHT]
The while loop condition is evaluated with starting initialized to 0. Since "good" is not a substring of "egmdartoa", text.find(sub, starting) returns -1 on the first call inside the loop. Therefore the loop runs exactly once: at the start of that single iteration starting is 0. After the find call starting becomes -1, the if-block is skipped, and the loop terminates.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
