[THOUGHT]
The list comprehension iterates over the given "characters" list [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], so there are 5 iterations. The loop variable i takes values in order: 1, 3, 6, 1, 2. The "characters" variable itself does not change during iteration, so to show its state per iteration we repeat the same list five times.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s, characters):
2     return [s[i:i+1] for i in characters]## [STATE]i=[1, 3, 6, 1, 2][/STATE] [STATE]characters=[[1, 3, 6, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6, 1, 2]][/STATE]
