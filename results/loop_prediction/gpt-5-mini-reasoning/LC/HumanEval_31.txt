[THOUGHT]
n = 13441. The loop range(2, n - 1) is range(2, 13440), which yields integers from 2 up to 13439 inclusive. The number of iterations is 13439 - 2 + 1 = 13438. So k takes the successive integer values 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439. The iterable range(2, n - 1) itself remains the same for every iteration, so its state can be shown repeated for each of the 13438 iterations.
