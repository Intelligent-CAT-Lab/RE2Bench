[THOUGHT]
Initial array = [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. l is a copy of that list and does not change during iteration.
Loop over l stops when we break after inserting elem into array.
Iteration 1: i = 3, 3 > 3 is False, k increments to 1.
Iteration 2: i = 5, 5 > 3 is True, insert elem (3) at index k (1) into array and break.
So i takes values [3, 5] and l remains [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] for both iterations (repeated twice).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
