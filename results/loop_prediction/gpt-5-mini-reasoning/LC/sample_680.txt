[THOUGHT]
The input string is "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324". Counting characters gives length 29 (indices 0..28). The for loop iterates i over range(29), so i takes values 0,1,...,28 in order. The range(len(text)) iterable is the same list of indices for every iteration, so its state can be represented as the full list [0..28] repeated 29 times (once per iteration).
