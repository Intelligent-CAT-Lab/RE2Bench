[THOUGHT]
We run the Euclidean algorithm with a=10, b=15.
- Before 1st iteration: b = 15 (loop condition true). After the assignment a,b = b, a%b -> a=15, b=10.
- Before 2nd iteration: b = 10. After assignment -> a=10, b=5.
- Before 3rd iteration: b = 5. After assignment -> a=5, b=0.
- Next check: b = 0 -> loop ends.
So b takes values 15, 10, 5 for the three iterations.
