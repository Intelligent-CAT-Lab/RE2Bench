[THOUGHT]
Initial x = 4. The while condition x > 0 is true for x = 4, so one iteration occurs. In that iteration ret becomes str(4 % 5) + "" -> "4". Then x //= 5 sets x = 4 // 5 = 0. The loop ends because x is now 0. Therefore the sequence of x values during loop iterations is [4].

2 
3     ret = ""
4     while x > 0:## [STATE]x=[4][/STATE]
5         ret = str(x % base) + ret
6         x //= base
7     return ret
