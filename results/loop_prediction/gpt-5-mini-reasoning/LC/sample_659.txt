[THOUGHT]
The function iterates over the list "bots" which contains 4 strings. On each iteration "username" takes the next element from the list in order:
1st: "yR?TAJhIW?n"
2nd: "o11BgEFDfoe"
3rd: "KnHdn2vdEd"
4th: "wvwruuqfhXbGis"
The variable "bots" itself remains the same list across all 4 iterations, so its state is the full list repeated 4 times.

1 def f(bots):

3     for username in bots:## [STATE]username=["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"][/STATE] [STATE]bots=[["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"], ["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"], ["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"], ["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"]][/STATE]
4         if not username.isupper():
5             clean.append(username[:2] + username[-3:])
6     return len(clean)
