[THOUGHT]
s1 = "abcdefghabc", s2 = "abc".
s1.rfind(s2) finds the last occurrence at index 8, so initial i = 8.
Loop iterations:
- 1st iteration: i = 8 (append 8+3-1 = 10), then i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, 8) -> finds the earlier occurrence at index 0.
- 2nd iteration: i = 0 (append 0+3-1 = 2), then i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, 0) -> no match, returns -1.
Loop stops. So i's values over the iterations are [8, 0].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
