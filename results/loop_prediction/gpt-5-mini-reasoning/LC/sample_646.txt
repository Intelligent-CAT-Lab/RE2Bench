[THOUGHT]
count is 2, so range(count) produces the sequence 0, 1. The loop runs twice:
- i = 0 on the first iteration
- i = 1 on the second iteration
The iterable range(count) (viewed as its contents) remains [0, 1] for each of the 2 iterations, so it's represented twice.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, count):
2     for i in range(count):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(count)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
3         text = ''.join(reversed(text))
4     return text
