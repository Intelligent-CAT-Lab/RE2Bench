[THOUGHT]
s = "h grateful k" has length 12, indices 0..11. The loop checks characters in order; the first space (separator) is at index 1, so the loop runs for i = 0 then i = 1 and returns inside the second iteration. range(len(s)) corresponds to the full list of indices [0..11], which is the same for each iteration, so show it repeated for the two iterations.

1 def f(s, separator):
2     for i in range(len(s)):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(s))=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]][/STATE]
3         if s[i] == separator:
4             new_s = list(s)
5             new_s[i] = '/'
6             return ' '.join(new_s)
