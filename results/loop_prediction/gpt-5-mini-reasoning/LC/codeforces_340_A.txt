[THOUGHT]
GCD is called with a=101, b=171. Evaluate a % b at the start of each loop iteration:
101 % 171 = 101 (loop runs)
171 % 101 = 70  (loop runs)
101 % 70  = 31  (loop runs)
70 % 31   = 8   (loop runs)
31 % 8    = 7   (loop runs)
8 % 7     = 1   (loop runs)
7 % 1     = 0   (loop stops; this final 0 is the check that ends the loop and is not part of an iteration)
So the values of a % b for the iterations are [101, 70, 31, 8, 7, 1].

1 def GCD ( a , b ) :
2     while a % b != 0 :## [STATE]a % b=[101, 70, 31, 8, 7, 1][/STATE]
3         a , b = b , a % b
4     return b
5 def LCM ( a , b ) :
6     return a * b // GCD ( a , b )
7 l = input ( ) . split ( ' ' )
8 x , y , a , b = int ( l [ 0 ] ) , int ( l [ 1 ] ) , int ( l [ 2 ] ) , int ( l [ 3 ] )
9 lcm = LCM ( x , y )
10 print ( b // lcm - ( a - 1 ) // lcm )
