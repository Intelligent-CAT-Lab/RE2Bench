[THOUGHT]
Initial length = len("jao mt") = 6. The while loop runs while length > 0, and each iteration decrements length by 1. So the value of length at the start of each iteration is: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (six iterations).
During each iteration index increments from 0 to 5 and value gets prefixed with the corresponding character from text, but the asked variable to track is length.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, value):
2     length = len(text)
3     index = 0
4     while length > 0:## [STATE]length=[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE]
5         value = text[index] + value
6         length -= 1
7         index += 1
8     return value
