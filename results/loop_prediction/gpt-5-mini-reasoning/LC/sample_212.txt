[THOUGHT]
len(nums) = 7, so len(nums) - 1 = 6. The for-loop iterates 6 times with _ taking the values 0 through 5. The range(...) expression is evaluated once and remains the same for each iteration; represent it as the list [0,1,2,3,4,5] repeated for each of the 6 iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):## [STATE]_=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(nums) - 1)=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]][/STATE]
3         nums.reverse()
4     return nums
