[THOUGHT]
Start: array = [1,2,3,4,5].
Line 2: result = array.copy() -> result = [1,2,3,4,5].
Line 3: result.reverse() -> result becomes [5,4,3,2,1].
Line 4: The list comprehension iterates over result in its current state [5,4,3,2,1]. The loop variable item takes values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in that order. During the comprehension, result remains [5,4,3,2,1] for each iteration (the slice assignment happens after the comprehension finishes).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array):
2     result = array.copy()
3     result.reverse()
4     result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]## [STATE]item=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE] [STATE]result=[[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]][/STATE]
5     return result
