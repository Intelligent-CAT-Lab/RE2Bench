[THOUGHT]
Input "1 1 1" gives k=1, n=1, w=1. range(1, w+1) -> range(1,2) which yields the sequence [1]. The loop runs once with i = 1. The range expanded is [1], repeated once (one iteration).

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[1]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
