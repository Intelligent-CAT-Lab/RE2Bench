[THOUGHT]
nums = [1,2,3].
Outer loop "for n1 in nums" iterates 3 times with n1 = 1, then 2, then 3.
During each outer iteration, nums remains the same list [1,2,3], so for the outer-loop marker we repeat nums 3 times.
Inner loop "for n2 in nums" runs 3 iterations for each outer iteration, so across the whole execution n2 takes: 1,2,3 (when n1=1), then 1,2,3 (when n1=2), then 1,2,3 (when n1=3) — total 9 values.
During each inner-iteration, nums is the same list [1,2,3]; there are 9 inner-iterations, so nums is repeated 9 times for that marker.

1 def f(nums, target):
2     count = 0
3     for n1 in nums:## [STATE]n1=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         for n2 in nums:## [STATE]n2=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
5             count += (n1+n2==target)
6     return count
