[THOUGHT]
nums is the list [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]. The for-loop iterates over each element in order, so n takes values 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1 across the six iterations. nums itself remains the same list during each iteration, so its state is repeated six times.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     output = []
3     for n in nums:## [STATE]n=[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]][/STATE]
4         output.append((nums.count(n), n))
5     output.sort(reverse=True)
6     return output
