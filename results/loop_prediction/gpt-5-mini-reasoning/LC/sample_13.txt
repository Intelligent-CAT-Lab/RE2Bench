[THOUGHT]
The input list names is ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]. The for-loop iterates once per element, so there are 3 iterations. Variable i takes each element in order: "sharron", then "Savannah", then "Mike Cherokee". The variable names does not change during the loop, so its value is the same list on each of the 3 iterations (repeat it 3 times).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(names):
2     count = len(names)
3     numberOfNames = 0
4     for i in names:## [STATE]i=["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"][/STATE] [STATE]names=[["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"], ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"], ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]][/STATE]
5         if i.isalpha():
6             numberOfNames += 1
7     return numberOfNames
