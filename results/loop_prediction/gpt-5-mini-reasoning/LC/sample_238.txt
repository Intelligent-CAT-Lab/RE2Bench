[THOUGHT]
ls is the list of three sublists. The for-loop iterates over ls in order, so i takes each sublist in sequence:
- first iteration: i = [1, 9, 4] (i[0] == 1 matches n)
- second iteration: i = [83, 0, 5]
- third iteration: i = [9, 6, 100]
ls itself remains the same across all iterations, so repeat the full ls three times to show its state at each iteration.

1 def f(ls, n):
2     answer = 0
3     for i in ls:## [STATE]i=[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]][/STATE] [STATE]ls=[[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]][/STATE]
4         if i[0] == n:
5             answer = i
6     return answer
