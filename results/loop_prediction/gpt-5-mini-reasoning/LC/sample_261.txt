[THOUGHT]
We iterate over nums = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]. The loop runs once per element (7 iterations). The loop variable i takes each element in order: 12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51. The list nums itself does not change during the loop, so its state is the full list repeated for each of the 7 iterations.

1 def f(nums, target):
2     lows, higgs = [], []
3     for i in nums:## [STATE]i=[12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]][/STATE]
4         if i < target:
5             lows.append(i)
6         else:
7             higgs.append(i)
8     lows.clear()
9     return lows, higgs
