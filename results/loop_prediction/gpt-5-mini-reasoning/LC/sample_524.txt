[THOUGHT]
dict0 has 5 keys, so new = dict0.copy() also has length 5. Therefore len(new)-1 = 4 and range(len(new)-1) is range(4), which iterates with i = 0, 1, 2, 3. The iterable value (the expanded range) stays the same across iterations, so it can be shown repeated for each iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(dict0):
2     new = dict0.copy()
3     for i in range(len(new)-1):## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(new)-1)=[[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         dict0[sorted(new)[i]] = i
5     return dict0
