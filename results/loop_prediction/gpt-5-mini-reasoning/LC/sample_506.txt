[THOUGHT]
n = 1 is odd, so the else branch is skipped and p becomes 'sn'.
The loop is for x in range(1, n+1) => range(1,2) which yields a single value: 1.
So x takes the values [1]. The iterable range(1, n+1) is the sequence [1], and since there is one iteration we repeat that once: [[1]].

1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1:
4         p+='sn'
5     else:
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):## [STATE]x=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range(1, n+1)=[[1]][/STATE]
8         if x%2 == 0:
9             p+='to'
10         else:
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
