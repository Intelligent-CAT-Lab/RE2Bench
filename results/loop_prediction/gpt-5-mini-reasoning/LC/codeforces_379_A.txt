[THOUGHT]
Input "80 970" gives a = 80, b = 970. x is initialized to a, so x = 80. The first while loop runs while x > 0, and each iteration does x -= 1, so x takes the values 80, 79, ..., 1 at the start of each iteration (80 iterations). After that loop x becomes 0. s increments once per iteration, so s becomes 80; because b = 970, s // b == 0, so the second while loop is not entered. Final h remains 80.

1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 x = a
3 h = 0
4 s = 0
5 while x > 0 :## [STATE]['x']=[80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE]
