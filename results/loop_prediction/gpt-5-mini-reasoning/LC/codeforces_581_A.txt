[THOUGHT]
Input string "1 1" .split() -> ['1', '1'], so x starts as ['1', '1'] and len(x) == 2. The for-loop iterates i = 0 then i = 1 (two iterations). The range(len(x)) is range(0, 2), which as a list of indices is [0, 1]; per the instruction to repeat a value that stays the same through K iterations, represent range(len(x)) as [[0, 1], [0, 1]] for the two iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
