Compute max(nums). nums = [77, 9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43] -> max = 77.
The for-loop is for i in range(77), so i takes values 0,1,2,...,76 (77 iterations).
range(m) (the sequence of loop indices) is the same list of numbers [0,1,2,...,76] for every iteration, so its value stays the same across all 77 iterations.
We only need to annotate the loop variables: i (the loop index sequence) and range(m) (the iterable, constant across iterations).
