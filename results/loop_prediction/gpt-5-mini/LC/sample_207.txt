[THOUGHT]
"commands" is the list [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]. The for-loop iterates over that list in order:
- First iteration: c = {"brown": 2}
- Second iteration: c = {"blue": 5}
- Third iteration: c = {"bright": 4}
"commands" itself stays the same list during each iteration, so its state is the same list repeated three times (once per iteration).

1 def f(commands):
2     d = {}
3     for c in commands:## [STATE]c=[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}][/STATE] [STATE]commands=[[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}], [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}], [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]][/STATE]
4         d.update(c)
5     return d
