[THOUGHT]
count = len(nums) = 5. range(2, count) is range(2,5) which produces the sequence 2, 3, 4 (three iterations). So num takes values 2, then 3, then 4. The range expression itself is the list [2, 3, 4], which is the same for each of the three iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     count = len(nums)
3     for num in range(2, count):## [STATE]num=[2, 3, 4][/STATE] [STATE]range(2, count)=[[2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]][/STATE]
4         nums.sort()
5     return nums
