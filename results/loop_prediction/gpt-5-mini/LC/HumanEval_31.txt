[THOUGHT]
n = 13441. The loop iterates over range(2, n - 1) which is range(2, 13440), producing the integers 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439. Therefore k takes the values 2 through 13439 in sequence (13438 iterations). The range expression itself corresponds to that sequence and, if shown per-iteration, would be that same list repeated 13438 times.
