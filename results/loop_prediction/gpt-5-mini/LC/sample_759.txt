[THOUGHT]
text = "egmdartoa", sub = "good". starting is initialized to 0. Enter while because 0 != -1. Inside, starting = text.find("good", 0) returns -1 (not found). The if block is skipped and loop ends. There is exactly one loop iteration, and the value of starting at that iteration's start was 0.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
