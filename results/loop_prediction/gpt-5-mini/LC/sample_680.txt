[THOUGHT]
The input string has length 29 (indices 0 through 28). The for-loop iterates i over range(29), so i takes values 0,1,...,28 in order. The range(len(text)) object (as the sequence of indices) remains the same for every iteration, so its value (the list of indices 0..28) is repeated 29 times (once per iteration).
