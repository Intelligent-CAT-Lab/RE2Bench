[THOUGHT]
Initial a=10, b=15.
Loop iterations:
- Iteration 1: b is 15 (loop runs). After a,b = b, a % b -> a=15, b=10.
- Iteration 2: b is 10 (loop runs). After assignment -> a=10, b=5.
- Iteration 3: b is 5 (loop runs). After assignment -> a=5, b=0.
- Iteration 4: b is 0 so loop stops.
So b's values while the loop runs are [15, 10, 5].
