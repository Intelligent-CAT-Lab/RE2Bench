[THOUGHT]
We iterate over items (5 elements). The loop variable text takes each element in order:
1) " bBb " -> text.rfind(" B ") returns -1 (no " B " substring).
2) " BaB " -> rfind returns -1.
3) " bB"  -> rfind returns -1.
4) " bBbB " -> rfind returns -1.
5) " bbb" -> rfind returns -1.
The list items itself remains the same during all iterations, so its state is the full list repeated for each of the 5 iterations.

1 def f(pattern, items):
2     result = []
3     for text in items:## [STATE]text=[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"][/STATE] [STATE]items=[[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"]][/STATE]
4         pos = text.rfind(pattern)
5         if pos >= 0:
6             result.append(pos)
7 
8     return result
