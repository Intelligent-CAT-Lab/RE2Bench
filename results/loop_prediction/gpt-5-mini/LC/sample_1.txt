[THOUGHT]
Inputs: a = [1], b = [1], c = [1, 2].
The for-loop iterates over the tuple (a, b, c), so there are 3 iterations.
- d takes the value of a on iteration 1 -> [1]
- d takes the value of b on iteration 2 -> [1]
- d takes the value of c on iteration 3 -> [1, 2]
The variables a, b, c themselves are not modified, so each repeats its value for each of the 3 iterations:
- a = [1] repeated 3 times -> [[1], [1], [1]]
- b = [1] repeated 3 times -> [[1], [1], [1]]
- c = [1, 2] repeated 3 times -> [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]

1 def f(a, b, c):
2     result = {}
3     for d in a, b, c:## [STATE]d=[[1], [1], [1, 2]][/STATE] [STATE]a=[[1], [1], [1]], b=[[1], [1], [1]], c=[[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]][/STATE]
4         result.update(dict.fromkeys(d))
5     return result
