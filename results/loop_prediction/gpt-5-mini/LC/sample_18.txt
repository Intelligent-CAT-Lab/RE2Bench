[THOUGHT]
Initial array = [3,5,4,3,2,1,0], elem = 3. l is a copy of array: [3,5,4,3,2,1,0]. k starts at 0.
Loop over l:
- Iteration 1: i = 3. Condition i > elem (3 > 3) is False. Increment k -> k = 1.
- Iteration 2: i = 5. Condition 5 > 3 is True. Insert elem (3) at index k (1) into array, resulting in [3,3,5,4,3,2,1,0]. Then break.
Loop stops after 2 iterations. Therefore i took values [3, 5], and l remained the same list for each of the 2 iterations (repeated twice).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
