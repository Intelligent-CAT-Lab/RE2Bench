[THOUGHT]
The input list "ints" is [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]. The for-loop iterates over each element in order, so i takes the values 2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89 respectively. The variable "ints" (the list itself) does not change during the loop, so its state is the same list repeated for each of the 8 iterations.
