[THOUGHT]
The input s is the string "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!".
s.split() produces the list ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"].
The list comprehension iterates over that list; the loop variable s (shadowing the parameter) takes each element in order:
"SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!".
s.split() is evaluated once before the loop and remains the same across all 5 iterations, so its state is that same list repeated 5 times.

1 def f(s):
2     return sum([s.istitle() for s in s.split()])## [STATE]s=["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"][/STATE] [STATE]s.split()=[["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"]][/STATE]
