[THOUGHT]
Initial x = 4, base = 5.
While loop condition x > 0 is true for x = 4, so one iteration occurs.
- Iteration 1: x = 4; ret becomes "4"; then x //= base -> x = 4 // 5 = 0.
After this update x = 0, loop stops. So the sequence of x values seen by the loop is [4].

1 def change_base(x: int, base: int):
2 
3     ret = ""
4     while x > 0:## [STATE]x=[4][/STATE]
5         ret = str(x % base) + ret
6         x //= base
7     return ret
