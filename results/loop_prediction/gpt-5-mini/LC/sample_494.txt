[THOUGHT]
Initial values: num = "1" (length 1), l = 3. The while condition l > len(num) is true for l=3 and l=2, and becomes false when l=1. Thus the loop runs 2 iterations. During iteration 1 l is 3, num is "1". During iteration 2 l is 2, num is "1". num does not change.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
