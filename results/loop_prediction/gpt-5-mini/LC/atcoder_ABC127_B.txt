[THOUGHT]
Input "2 100 105" gives r = 2, D = 100, x = 105.
The for-loop iterates i over range(10), so i takes values 0 through 9 (10 iterations).
The range(10) object/value is constant across iterations; per instructions, repeat its value for each of the 10 iterations.

1 r , D , x = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( 10 ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 10 )=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]][/STATE]
