[THOUGHT]
n = 3. reversed(range(3)) yields the sequence 2, 1, 0.
The loop executes until a return. For i=2, 3 % 2 != 0 so it continues. For i=1, 3 % 1 == 0 so the function returns at that iteration. Therefore the loop actually iterates with i = 2 then i = 1 (stops before i = 0).
Following the example's style, show the full sequence produced by reversed(range(n)) as a list repeated for each actual iteration.

1 def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
2 
3     for i in reversed(range(n)):## [STATE]i=[2, 1][/STATE] [STATE]reversed(range(n))=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         if n % i == 0:
5             return i
