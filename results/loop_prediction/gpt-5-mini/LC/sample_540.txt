[THOUGHT]
len(a) = 6, so range(0, len(a) - 1, 2) = range(0, 5, 2) which yields the sequence 0, 2, 4 — three iterations.
Thus k takes values [0, 2, 4] across the iterations.
For the range expression, show its full sequence repeated for each iteration: [[0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 4]].
(For reference, b starts as a.copy() = [5,5,5,6,4,9] and after inserts becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,6,4,9] then appended with b[0] -> final [5,5,5,5,5,5,6,4,9,5].)

1 def f(a):
2     b = a.copy()
3     for k in range(0, len(a) - 1, 2):## [STATE]k=[0, 2, 4][/STATE] [STATE]range(0, len(a) - 1, 2)=[[0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 4]][/STATE]
4         b.insert(k + 1, b[k])
5     b.append(b[0])
6     return b
