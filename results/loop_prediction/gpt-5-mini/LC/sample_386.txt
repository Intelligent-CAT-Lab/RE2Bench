[THOUGHT]
count = len(di) = 3. range(count) is evaluated once at the start as range(0, 3) -> [0, 1, 2]. The loop will iterate with i = 0, then 1, then 2. Mutating di inside the loop (di.pop) would change di, but does not change the already-evaluated range. For completeness, represent the iterable range(count) as the same list repeated for each iteration (3 times).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(concat, di):
2     count = len(di)
3     for i in range(count):## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2][/STATE] [STATE]range(count)=[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]][/STATE]
4         if di[str(i)] in concat:
5             di.pop(str(i))
6     return "Done!"
