[THOUGHT]
polynomials is the dict {"2": "x*y"}. Iterating "for deg in polynomials" yields the dict keys, so there is a single iteration with deg = "2". polynomials itself remains the same dict during that (one) iteration, so repeat its value once.
hp_params is provided as null (None), but there is no loop marker for it to annotate here; the only loop-marked variables are deg and polynomials on the outer loop.
