[THOUGHT]
The loop iterates over ls which has three sublists. So i takes each sublist in order: [1, 9, 4], then [83, 0, 5], then [9, 6, 100]. The list ls itself remains the same across all iterations, so its state is the full list repeated three times (once per iteration).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(ls, n):
2     answer = 0
3     for i in ls:## [STATE]i=[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]][/STATE] [STATE]ls=[[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]][/STATE]
4         if i[0] == n:
5             answer = i
6     return answer
