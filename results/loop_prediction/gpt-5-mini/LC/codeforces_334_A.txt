[THOUGHT]
n is 8 from input. So n*n = 64, initial i = 1, j = 64.
Each loop iteration increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1. Before each iteration the condition i < j is checked.
After k iterations (k starting at 0), i = 1 + k and j = 64 - k. The loop runs while 1 + k < 64 - k -> 2k < 63 -> k <= 31.
Thus the loop executes for k = 0..31 inclusive, i.e., 32 iterations. For each of these iterations the condition i < j evaluates to True. The loop exits when i becomes 33 and j becomes 32 (i < j is False), but that final False check is after the last iteration and is not part of the per-iteration "True" states.

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 i , j = 1 , n * n
3 while i < j :## [STATE]i<j=[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True][/STATE]
4     print ( i , j )
5     i += 1
6     j -= 1
