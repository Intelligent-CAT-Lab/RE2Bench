[THOUGHT]
Input "1 1 1" gives k = 1, n = 1, w = 1.
The loop is for i in range(1, w + 1) -> range(1, 2), so i takes values [1] (a single iteration).
Across the iteration, i = 1. The range(1, w + 1) can be represented as the list of values it yields; since there is one iteration, show it as [[1]] to represent its state per iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[1]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
