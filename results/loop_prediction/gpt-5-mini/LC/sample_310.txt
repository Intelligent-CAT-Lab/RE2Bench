We iterate over subs (10 items), so i takes values 0 through 9. At each outer iteration j is the current element subs[i] (none of the earlier iterations modify other indices, so j equals the original element at that index when reached). Compute len(j)//2 for each j to see how many inner iterations occur:

Indices and values:
0: "__" (len 2) -> len//2 = 1 -> range(1) -> inner _ takes [0] (one iteration)
1: "1"  (len 1) -> 0 -> []
2: "."  (len 1) -> 0 -> []
3: "0"  (len 1) -> 0 -> []
4: "0r" (len 2) -> 1 -> [0]
5: "__" (len 2) -> 1 -> [0]
6: "j_a"(len 3) -> 1 -> [0]
7: "6"  (len 1) -> 0 -> []
8: "__" (len 2) -> 1 -> [0]
9: "6"  (len 1) -> 0 -> []

So range(len(j)//2) per outer iteration is: [[0], [], [], [], [0], [0], [0], [], [0], []].
The inner-loop variable _ takes values in execution order for the iterations that run: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (one 0 for each of indices 0,4,5,6,8).

(For completeness: the string transformation subs[i] = subs[i][-1:] + subs[i][1:-1] + subs[i][0] leaves "__" unchanged, turns "0r" -> "r0", and "j_a" -> "a_j".)
