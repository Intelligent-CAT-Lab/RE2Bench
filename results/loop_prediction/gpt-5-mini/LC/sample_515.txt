[THOUGHT]
Start: array = [1,2,3,4,5]
Line 2: result = array.copy() -> result = [1,2,3,4,5]
Line 3: result.reverse() -> result = [5,4,3,2,1]
Line 4: the list comprehension iterates over the current result list [5,4,3,2,1].
- item takes values in order: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (five iterations).
- During each iteration, result remains the same list [5,4,3,2,1] (the comprehension is evaluated before the slice assignment).
After the comprehension finishes, result[:] is assigned the new list [10,8,6,4,2], but the per-iteration states are as above.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array):
2     result = array.copy()
3     result.reverse()
4     result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]## [STATE]item=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE] [STATE]result=[[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]][/STATE]
5     return result
