[THOUGHT]
text = "USaR", len(text) = 4. The while condition is index < 4.
Start index = 1.
Iteration 1: index = 1, compare text[1]='S' to text[0]='U' -> different, so index becomes 2.
Iteration 2: index = 2, compare text[2]='a' to text[1]='S' -> different, so index becomes 3.
Iteration 3: index = 3, compare text[3]='R' to text[2]='a' -> different, so index becomes 4.
Loop stops because index == 4 is not < 4. text never changes during the loop.
So index values at the start of each iteration are [1, 2, 3], and text is ["USaR", "USaR", "USaR"] for those iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     index = 1
3     while index < len(text):## [STATE]index=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]text=["USaR", "USaR", "USaR"][/STATE]
4         if text[index] != text[index - 1]:
5             index += 1
6         else:
7             text1 = text[:index]
8             text2 = text[index:].swapcase()
9             return text1 + text2
10     return text.swapcase()
