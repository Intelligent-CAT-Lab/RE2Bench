[THOUGHT]
Initial text = "ndbtdabdahesyehu" and prefix = "n".
Check while condition: text.startswith("n") is True for the initial text, so the loop runs once.
Inside the loop text becomes text[1:] which is "dbtdabdahesyehu" (non-empty), so assignment yields that value.
After that iteration the while condition text.startswith("n") is False, so the loop stops.
Thus the value of text at the start of each loop iteration is just the initial string once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, prefix):
2     while text.startswith(prefix):## [STATE]text=["ndbtdabdahesyehu"][/STATE]
3         text = text[len(prefix):] or text
4     return text
