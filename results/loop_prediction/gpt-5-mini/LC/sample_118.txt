[THOUGHT]
num_applies = 2 so range(num_applies) yields the sequence [0, 1].
The loop runs twice (K = 2). i takes values 0 then 1, so list for i is [0, 1].
The iterable range(num_applies) is the same each iteration, so repeated twice: [[0, 1], [0, 1]].
(For completeness: extra_chars starts as '', becomes 'mk' after i=0, then 'mkmk' after i=1. text has no 'mk' or 'mkmk' substrings, so it remains unchanged.)

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, chars):
2     num_applies = 2
3     extra_chars = ''
4     for i in range(num_applies):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(num_applies)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
5         extra_chars += chars
6         text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
7     return text
