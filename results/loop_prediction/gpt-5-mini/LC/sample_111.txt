[THOUGHT]
The dictionary preserves insertion order. The values in order are: 67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83. The loop iterates over these six values. The loop variable value takes each of these ints in sequence. marks.values() stays the same for every iteration, so repeat the full values list once per iteration (6 times).

1 def f(marks):
2     highest = 0
3     lowest = 100
4     for value in marks.values():## [STATE]value=[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83][/STATE] [STATE]marks.values()=[[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]][/STATE]
5         if value > highest:
6             highest = value
7         if value < lowest:
8             lowest = value
9     return highest, lowest
