[THOUGHT]
numbers = [11, 3]. enumerate(numbers) yields the sequence of pairs (index, value): (0, 11) then (1, 3).
So i takes values 0 then 1 across the two iterations.
The enumerate(numbers) iterable (represented as the full list of pairs) remains the same for each iteration, so it's repeated twice.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(numbers):
2     new_numbers = []
3     for i, _ in enumerate(numbers):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]enumerate(numbers)=[[(0, 11), (1, 3)], [(0, 11), (1, 3)]][/STATE]
4         new_numbers.append(numbers[len(numbers)-1-i])
5     return new_numbers
