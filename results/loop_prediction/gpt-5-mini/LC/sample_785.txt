[THOUGHT]
n is 1 so str(n) is "1". The for-loop iterates over the characters of "1", which is a single character '1'. Therefore c takes the value '1' once. str(n) remains ["1"] during that one iteration.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[["1"]][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
