s = "h grateful k" has length 12 (indices 0..11). range(len(s)) -> range(0, 12) which as a list is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].
The loop checks s[i] against separator " ". At i=0 s[0] = 'h' != ' ', so continue. At i=1 s[1] = ' ' == separator, so the function returns during the second iteration. Therefore the loop runs for i = 0 then i = 1, and range(len(s)) remains the same iterable during each of those iterations.

1 def f(s, separator):
2     for i in range(len(s)):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(s))=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]][/STATE]
3         if s[i] == separator:
4             new_s = list(s)
5             new_s[i] = '/'
6             return ' '.join(new_s)
