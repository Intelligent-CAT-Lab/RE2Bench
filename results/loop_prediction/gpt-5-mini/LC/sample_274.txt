[THOUGHT]
nums = [1, 2, 3]. The outer for-loop iterates n1 over 1, then 2, then 3 (3 iterations). nums itself remains the same list during each outer iteration, so repeat it 3 times for the outer-loop annotation.

The inner for-loop runs for each outer iteration and iterates n2 over 1, 2, 3. Across the whole execution the inner loop runs 3 times per outer iteration × 3 outer iterations = 9 inner iterations, so n2's sequence across the full execution is [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]. The nums list remains the same during each inner iteration, so repeat it 9 times for the inner-loop annotation.

1 def f(nums, target):
2     count = 0
3     for n1 in nums:## [STATE]n1=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         for n2 in nums:## [STATE]n2=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
5             count += (n1+n2==target)
6     return count
