[THOUGHT]
a = 80, b = 970 from input. x starts as 80, h = 0, s = 0.
The first while loop runs while x > 0. Each iteration decrements x by 1 and increments h and s by 1.
So the loop runs 80 iterations with x taking values 80, 79, ..., 1 at the start of each iteration (after the loop x becomes 0, h and s become 80).
The second while loop checks s // b != 0; since s is 80 and b is 970, 80 // 970 == 0, so the second loop does not run.
