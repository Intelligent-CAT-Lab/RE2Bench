[THOUGHT]
The input list lst is [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]. The for-loop iterates over each element in order, so i takes -1.4, then 17.9, then 18.9, then 19.9. The list lst itself does not change during iteration, so its state is the same for each of the 4 iterations (repeat the full list 4 times).

1 def sum_squares(lst):
2 
3     import math
4     squared = 0
5     for i in lst:## [STATE]i=[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9][/STATE] [STATE]lst=[[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]][/STATE]
6         squared += math.ceil(i)**2
7     return squared
