[THOUGHT]
"text" is "Mammoth", length 7. enumerate(text) yields (0,"M"), (1,"a"), (2,"m"), (3,"m"), (4,"o"), (5,"t"), (6,"h").
So i takes values 0 through 6 in order, c takes corresponding characters. enumerate(text) (the iterable) is the same full list of pairs on each iteration, so we repeat that list 7 times (once per iteration).
