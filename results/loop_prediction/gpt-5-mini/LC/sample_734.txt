[THOUGHT]
Initial nums = [5, 3, 3, 7], so len(nums) = 4 and len(nums) - 2 = 2. The range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1) produces the sequence [2, 1, 0], which is determined once at loop start and does not change as nums is mutated. The loop iterates three times with i taking values 2, then 1, then 0. For each i we check nums[i] % 2 == 0; all elements at indices 2,1,0 are 3,3,5 respectively (all odd), so no removals occur and nums stays [5,3,3,7] throughout.

1 def f(nums):
2     for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
3         if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
4             nums.remove(nums[i])
5     return nums
