[THOUGHT]
We convert the input string to a list of its characters. The string "Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#" has 28 characters (indices 0..27). The for loop iterates i over range(len(text)) which is range(0, 28) — equivalently the list [0, 1, ..., 27]. So i takes values 0 through 27 in order. The range(len(text)) value (the sequence of indices) stays the same for each of the 28 iterations, so we repeat that list 28 times for its state.
