[THOUGHT]
Input string "1 1" is split into x = ["1", "1"].
len(x) == 2 so range(len(x)) is range(0, 2) and the loop iterates with i = 0 then i = 1.
During each iteration x[i] is converted to int resulting in x becoming [1, 1] after the loop.
Thus i takes values 0 and 1; range(len(x)) is the same range object for both iterations (range(0, 2)).

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[range(0, 2), range(0, 2)][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
