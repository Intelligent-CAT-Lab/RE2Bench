[THOUGHT]
aDict is {"1":1, "2":2, "3":3}. Iterating aDict.items() yields the key-value tuples in insertion order: ("1", 1), then ("2", 2), then ("3", 3). So v takes these three tuples across the three iterations. aDict.items() as a sequence of items can be represented as [("1",1), ("2",2), ("3",3)], and that same view/state is observed on each of the three iterations.
