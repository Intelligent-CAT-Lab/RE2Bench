[THOUGHT]
n = 1 so range(1, n+1) is range(1, 2) which yields [1]. The for-loop runs exactly once with x = 1. Because there's one iteration, x's state list is [1]. The range object (as a sequence of its elements) is [1], and repeated once for the single iteration becomes [[1]].

1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1:
4         p+='sn'
5     else:
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):## [STATE]x=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range(1, n+1)=[[1]][/STATE]
8         if x%2 == 0:
9             p+='to'
10         else:
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
