Let me trace through this nested loop structure step by step.

Given:
- nums = [1, 2, 3]
- target = 4

**Outer loop (Line 3): `for n1 in nums:`**
The outer loop iterates 3 times, once for each element in nums:
- Iteration 1: n1 = 1
- Iteration 2: n1 = 2
- Iteration 3: n1 = 3

So n1 takes values: [1, 2, 3]

The variable nums remains constant throughout all outer iterations, staying [1, 2, 3], so it should be repeated 3 times (once for each outer loop iteration).

**Inner loop (Line 4): `for n2 in nums:`**
The inner loop is inside the body of the outer loop. For each outer loop iteration, the inner loop executes and iterates over nums [1, 2, 3].

- Outer iteration 1 (n1=1): Inner loop runs with n2 = 1, 2, 3
- Outer iteration 2 (n1=2): Inner loop runs with n2 = 1, 2, 3
- Outer iteration 3 (n1=3): Inner loop runs with n2 = 1, 2, 3

So n2 takes values across all 9 inner loop iterations: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

The variable nums remains constant throughout all inner loop iterations, staying [1, 2, 3], so it should be repeated 9 times (once for each inner loop iteration).

1 def f(nums, target):
2     count = 0
3     for n1 in nums:## [STATE]n1=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         for n2 in nums:## [STATE]n2=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
5             count += (n1+n2==target)
6     return count
