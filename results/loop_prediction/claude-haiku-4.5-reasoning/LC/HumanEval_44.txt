[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `change_base(4, 5)` execution:

Initial state:
- x = 4
- base = 5
- ret = ""

**Iteration 1:**
- Check condition: x > 0 → 4 > 0 → True, enter loop
- ret = str(4 % 5) + "" = str(4) + "" = "4"
- x = 4 // 5 = 0
- x is now 0

**After Iteration 1:**
- Check condition: x > 0 → 0 > 0 → False, exit loop

The while loop executes once. At the start of that iteration, x = 4. After one iteration, x becomes 0 and the condition fails, so the loop terminates.

Therefore, the state of x across iterations is: [4]

3     ret = ""
4     while x > 0:## [STATE]x=[4][/STATE]
5         ret = str(x % base) + ret
6         x //= base
7     return ret
