[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this list comprehension with `n = 3`.

The list comprehension is: `[n + 2*i for i in range(n)]`

With `n = 3`:
- `range(n)` = `range(3)` which iterates over: 0, 1, 2
- So there are 3 iterations

For each iteration:
- Iteration 1: `i = 0`
- Iteration 2: `i = 1`
- Iteration 3: `i = 2`

Therefore:
- `i` takes the values: [0, 1, 2]
- `range(n)` remains `range(3)` throughout all 3 iterations, which expands to [0, 1, 2]

Following the example format where constant variables are repeated for each iteration:
- `i` state: `[0, 1, 2]` (the values it takes)
- `range(n)` state: `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]` (the expanded range repeated 3 times, once for each iteration)
