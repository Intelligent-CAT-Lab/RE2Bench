[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the loop step by step.

The input is `nums = [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]` which has 6 elements.

The loop `for n in nums:` iterates over each element in `nums`:
- Iteration 1: `n = 1` (first element)
- Iteration 2: `n = 1` (second element)
- Iteration 3: `n = 3` (third element)
- Iteration 4: `n = 1` (fourth element)
- Iteration 5: `n = 3` (fifth element)
- Iteration 6: `n = 1` (sixth element)

`nums` remains unchanged throughout all iterations and equals `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.

Since `nums` stays the same for all 6 iterations, I need to repeat `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]` 6 times.

4         output.append((nums.count(n), n))
5     output.sort(reverse=True)
6     return output
