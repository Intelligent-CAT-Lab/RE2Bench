[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code with the input `text = "meet"`.

1. `text = "meet"`
2. `if text == '':` - "meet" is not empty, so continue
3. `first_char = text[0]` - first_char = "m"
4. `if text[0].isdigit():` - "m" is not a digit, so continue
5. `for last_char in text:` - Now we loop through each character in "meet"

The loop will iterate 4 times (one for each character):
- Iteration 1: last_char = "m"
- Iteration 2: last_char = "e"  
- Iteration 3: last_char = "e"
- Iteration 4: last_char = "t"

During all iterations, `text` remains unchanged as "meet".

For the variable states:
- `last_char` changes in each iteration: ["m", "e", "e", "t"]
- `text` stays the same through all 4 iterations. Following the example convention where strings are represented as lists of characters, "meet" becomes ["m", "e", "e", "t"]. Since this stays the same for 4 iterations, we repeat it 4 times: [["m", "e", "e", "t"], ["m", "e", "e", "t"], ["m", "e", "e", "t"], ["m", "e", "e", "t"]]
