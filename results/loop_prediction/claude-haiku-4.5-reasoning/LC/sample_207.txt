[THOUGHT]
`commands` is a list containing 3 dictionaries:
```
[
    {"brown": 2},
    {"blue": 5},
    {"bright": 4}
]
```

The loop iterates over each dictionary in the list:

Iteration 1:
- `c` = `{"brown": 2}`
- `commands` = `[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]` (unchanged)

Iteration 2:
- `c` = `{"blue": 5}`
- `commands` = `[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]` (unchanged)

Iteration 3:
- `c` = `{"bright": 4}`
- `commands` = `[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]` (unchanged)

For `c`: The variable changes at each iteration, taking on each dictionary in turn.
For `commands`: The variable stays constant throughout all 3 iterations, so the same list is repeated 3 times in the state representation.
