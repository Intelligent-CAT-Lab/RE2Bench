Let me trace through the code step by step with the given inputs: `num = "1"`, `l = 3`

Initial state before the loop:
- `num = "1"` (string of length 1)
- `l = 3`

**Iteration 1:**
- Check condition at line 3: `l > len(num)` → `3 > 1` → True
- State at this point: `l = 3`, `num = "1"`
- Execute loop body:
  - `t += '0'` → `t = "0"`
  - `l -= 1` → `l = 2`

**Iteration 2:**
- Check condition at line 3: `l > len(num)` → `2 > 1` → True
- State at this point: `l = 2`, `num = "1"` (num hasn't changed)
- Execute loop body:
  - `t += '0'` → `t = "00"`
  - `l -= 1` → `l = 1`

**Check condition again:**
- Check condition at line 3: `l > len(num)` → `1 > 1` → False
- Loop exits (no iteration 3)

The loop executes 2 times total.

States recorded at the while condition line for each executing iteration:
- Iteration 1: `l = 3`, `num = "1"`
- Iteration 2: `l = 2`, `num = "1"`

Therefore:
- `l` changes across iterations: `l = [3, 2]`
- `num` stays the same through both iterations: `num = ["1", "1"]` (repeated 2 times per the instructions)

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
