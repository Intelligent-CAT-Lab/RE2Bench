[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step.

The function `sum_squares` takes `lst` as input: `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`

The loop on line 5 is `for i in lst:`, which iterates over each element:
- Iteration 1: `i = -1.4`
- Iteration 2: `i = 17.9`
- Iteration 3: `i = 18.9`
- Iteration 4: `i = 19.9`

The variable `lst` remains constant throughout all iterations: `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`

Following the pattern from the example:
- For the changing variable `i`, I list all values: `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`
- For the static variable `lst`, I repeat its value K times (once per iteration), wrapped: `[[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]]`
