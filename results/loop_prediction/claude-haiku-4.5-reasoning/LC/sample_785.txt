[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step.

Given input: `n = 1`

First, I need to evaluate `str(n)`:
- `str(1) = "1"` (a string with one character)

The loop `for c in str(n):` iterates over the string "1":
- Iteration 1: `c = '1'`

Since the string "1" has only one character, the loop runs exactly 1 time.

For variable `c`:
- Takes the value `'1'` in iteration 1
- State: `['1']` (list of values across iterations)

For variable `str(n)`:
- The value is the string `"1"`, which stays constant throughout
- According to the instruction: "If the value of a variable stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times"
- The string "1" represented as a list of characters is `['1']`
- Since this is constant for K=1 iteration, we show it as a nested list: `[['1']]`

This follows the pattern from the example where constant iterables are shown as nested lists with the value repeated for each iteration.

1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[["1"]][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
