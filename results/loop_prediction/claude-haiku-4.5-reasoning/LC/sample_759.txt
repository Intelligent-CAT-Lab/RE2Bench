[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with `text = "egmdartoa"` and `sub = "good"`.

Initial state (line 3): `starting = 0`

**First evaluation of while condition (line 4):**
- Condition: `starting != -1` with `starting = 0` → True (this is iteration 1)
- State at marker: `starting = 0`

**Execute loop body (lines 5-8):**
- Line 5: `starting = text.find("good", 0)`
  - The substring "good" does not exist in "egmdartoa"
  - `find()` returns -1
  - So `starting = -1`
- Line 6: Check `if starting != -1` with `starting = -1` → False
- Skip lines 7-8

**Return to while condition (line 4):**
- Condition: `starting != -1` with `starting = -1` → False
- Exit the loop (no more iterations)

The loop body executes exactly once. At the state marker (the while condition line 4) during that execution, `starting = 0`.

Therefore, the state is a list containing one value (for one iteration): `[0]`

1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
