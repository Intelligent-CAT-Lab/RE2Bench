[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Given:
- s1 = "abcdefghabc"
- s2 = "abc"

Line 3: `i = s1.rfind(s2)`
- rfind finds the rightmost occurrence of "abc" in "abcdefghabc"
- In "abcdefghabc", "abc" appears at position 0 and position 8
- rfind returns the starting index of the rightmost match: i = 8

**First iteration:**
- Condition: i != -1 is True (8 != -1)
- Loop body executes with i = 8
- Line 6: i = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 8) searches in s1[0:8] = "abcdefgh"
- "abc" is found at position 0
- i becomes 0

**Second iteration:**
- Condition: i != -1 is True (0 != -1)
- Loop body executes with i = 0
- Line 6: i = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 0) searches in s1[0:0] = ""
- "abc" is not found in empty string
- i becomes -1

**Third check:**
- Condition: i != -1 is False (-1 == -1)
- Loop exits, body doesn't execute

The loop executes 2 times with i values: [8, 0]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
