Let me trace through this code step by step.

Given:
- `s` = "h grateful k" 
- `separator` = " "

First, I need to determine `len(s)`:
- s = "h grateful k" has 12 characters
- s[0]='h', s[1]=' ', s[2]='g', s[3]='r', s[4]='a', s[5]='t', s[6]='e', s[7]='f', s[8]='u', s[9]='l', s[10]=' ', s[11]='k'

So `range(len(s))` = `range(12)` = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

Now let me trace through the loop iterations:

**Iteration 1 (i=0):**
- `i = 0`
- `s[0] = 'h'`
- Check: `'h' == ' '`? No, so we don't enter the if block
- Loop continues

**Iteration 2 (i=1):**
- `i = 1`
- `s[1] = ' '`
- Check: `' ' == ' '`? Yes! We enter the if block
- We execute `return ' '.join(new_s)` which exits the function immediately

So the loop only executes for `i = 0` and `i = 1` before the function returns.

For the states:
- `i` varies across iterations: [0, 1]
- `range(len(s))` is constant across iterations (always [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]), and since ranges are iterable, we repeat the list representation for each of the 2 iterations: [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]]
