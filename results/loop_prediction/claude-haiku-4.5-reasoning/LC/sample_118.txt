[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this loop step by step.

Initial state:
- num_applies = 2
- range(num_applies) = range(2), which yields values: 0, 1
- extra_chars = ''
- text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx"
- chars = "mk"

The loop `for i in range(num_applies):` will execute 2 times:

**Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
- extra_chars = '' + 'mk' = 'mk'
- text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx".replace('mk', '') = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no 'mk' substring exists)

**Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
- extra_chars = 'mk' + 'mk' = 'mkmk'
- text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx".replace('mkmk', '') = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no 'mkmk' substring exists)

So the loop variable `i` takes the values: 0, 1

The iterable `range(num_applies)` which is `range(2)` stays constant throughout. Following the pattern from the example where unchanging iterables are represented with their elements repeated for each iteration:
- range(2) yields elements [0, 1]
- Since it doesn't change across 2 iterations, we represent it as [[0, 1], [0, 1]]

1 def f(text, chars):
2     num_applies = 2
3     extra_chars = ''
4     for i in range(num_applies):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(num_applies)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
5         extra_chars += chars
6         text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
7     return text
