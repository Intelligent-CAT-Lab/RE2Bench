[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with `n = 13441`.

The function starts with `if n < 2:` which is False since 13441 is not less than 2, so we proceed to the loop.

The loop is: `for k in range(2, n - 1):`

With `n = 13441`, this becomes: `for k in range(2, 13440):`

The `range(2, 13440)` object generates integers starting from 2 and stopping before 13440, so it produces: 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 13437, 13438, 13439.

This means:
- The loop iterates 13440 - 2 = 13438 times
- `k` takes on the values: 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 13437, 13438, 13439 (one value per iteration)
- `range(2, n - 1)` evaluates to `range(2, 13440)` and stays the same across all 13438 iterations

For the state annotation:
- `k` changes each iteration: `[2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 13437, 13438, 13439]`
- `range(2, n - 1)` (which is `range(2, 13440)`) stays constant and is repeated for each iteration: `[range(2, 13440), range(2, 13440), ..., range(2, 13440)]`
