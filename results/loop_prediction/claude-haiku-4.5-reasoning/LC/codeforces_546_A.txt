# [THOUGHT]

Let me trace through this code with the input "1 1 1".

First, the input is split and mapped to integers:
- k = 1
- n = 1  
- w = 1

Then sum = 0.

Now for the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, w + 1):
```

Since w = 1, this becomes:
```python
for i in range(1, 2):
```

The range(1, 2) generates the single value: 1

So the loop iterations are:
- Iteration 1: i = 1 (sum += 1 * 1)

For the state variables:
- **i (loop variable)**: This changes with each iteration. It takes the values: [1]
- **range(1, w + 1)**: This evaluates to range(1, 2) and stays constant throughout the loop. Following the pattern from the example where unchanging variables are repeated per iteration, I need to represent what range(1, 2) generates (which is [1]) repeated for the 1 iteration: [[1]]

This parallels the example where the unchanging variable `t` was shown as a repeated list representation across iterations.

# [ANSWER]

1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[1]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
