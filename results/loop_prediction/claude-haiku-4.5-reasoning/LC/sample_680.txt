`text` is the string "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324"

Let me count its length by enumerating each character:
w(1), e(2), @(3), 3(4), 2(5), r(6), 7(7), 1(8), g(9), 7(10), 2(11), u(12), g(13), 9(14), 4(15), =(16), ((17), 8(18), 2(19), 3(20), 6(21), 5(22), 8(23), *(24), !(25), @(26), 3(27), 2(28), 4(29)

So `len(text)` = 29, and `range(len(text))` = `range(29)` which produces [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 28]

The loop `for i in range(len(text)):` will iterate 29 times:
- Iteration 0: i = 0
- Iteration 1: i = 1
- Iteration 2: i = 2
- ...
- Iteration 28: i = 28

So `i` takes the values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

`range(len(text))` is constant throughout all 29 iterations and always equals `range(29)` (which expands to [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 28]). Following the pattern from the example where constant variables are represented as nested lists (repeated once per iteration), this should be shown as a list repeated 29 times, with each inner list being [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 28].
