[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The function `f` is called with `text = "hbtofdeiequ"`.

Line 2: `new_text = list(text)` converts the string to a list of characters.

Line 3: `for i in '+':`
The loop iterates over the string `'+'`. This is a single-character string containing only the character `'+'`.

Since the string `'+'` has only 1 character, the loop body executes exactly once:
- Iteration 1: `i = '+'`

That's the only iteration in this loop.

Following the pattern from the example:
- For a loop variable that changes across iterations, we list all its values in a single list
- In this case, `i` takes only one value: `'+'`
- The state should be: `['+']`

This represents all the values that `i` takes across all iterations of the loop (which is just one iteration with value `'+'`).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     for i in '+':## [STATE]i=['+'][/STATE]
4         if i in new_text:
5             new_text.remove(i)
6     return ''.join(new_text)
