[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

First, I need to find the value of `m`:
- `nums = [77, 9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43]`
- `m = max(nums) = 77`

Next, the loop is `for i in range(m):` which becomes `for i in range(77):`
- This loop will iterate 77 times
- `i` takes values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 76 (all 77 values)
- `range(m)` is `range(77)`, which produces the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 76]
- `range(m)` stays the same throughout all 77 iterations

For the state markers:
- `i`: Changes each iteration, taking all values from 0 to 76. This is represented as: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 76]`
- `range(m)`: Stays the same each iteration (range(77) / [0, 1, 2, ..., 76]). Since it stays the same for 77 iterations, it should be repeated 77 times: `[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 76]] * 77`
</THOUGHT>
