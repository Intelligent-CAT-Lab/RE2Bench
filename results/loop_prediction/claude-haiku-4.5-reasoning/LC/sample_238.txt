<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The function `f(ls, n)` is called with:
- `ls = [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
- `n = 1`

The loop iterates over each element in `ls`:

**Iteration 1:**
- `i = [1, 9, 4]`
- `ls = [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` (unchanged)

**Iteration 2:**
- `i = [83, 0, 5]`
- `ls = [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` (unchanged)

**Iteration 3:**
- `i = [9, 6, 100]`
- `ls = [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` (unchanged)

Following the pattern from the example:
- `i` takes different values at each iteration, so the state is: `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` (a list of all values)
- `ls` stays the same throughout all 3 iterations, so the state repeats its value 3 times: `[[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]]`
