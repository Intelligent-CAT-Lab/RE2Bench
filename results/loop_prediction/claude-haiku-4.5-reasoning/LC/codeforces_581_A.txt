[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step.

Input: " 1 1"

Line 1: `x = list(input().split())`
- `input()` returns " 1 1"
- `.split()` returns ['1', '1'] (splits on whitespace)
- `x = ['1', '1']`

Line 2: `for i in range(len(x)):`
- `len(x) = 2`
- `range(2)` produces the values 0, 1
- The loop will execute 2 times

For the loop variables:
- `i` takes values: 0 (iteration 1), then 1 (iteration 2)
  - State: [0, 1]

- `range(len(x))` evaluates to `range(2)` which represents the sequence [0, 1]
  - This stays the same throughout both iterations
  - Following the example pattern where constant values are repeated for K iterations:
  - State: [[0, 1], [0, 1]]

The example shows that when a value doesn't change, we show its representation repeated K times. Since `range(2)` can be represented as the sequence [0, 1], and it doesn't change through 2 iterations, we repeat it: [[0, 1], [0, 1]].

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
