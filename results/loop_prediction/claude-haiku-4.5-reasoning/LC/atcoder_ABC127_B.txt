Let me trace through the code with input "2 100 105":

After parsing:
- r = 2
- D = 100  
- x = 105

The loop `for i in range(10)` iterates 10 times (i = 0 through 9).

For the loop variable `i`:
- Iteration 1: i = 0
- Iteration 2: i = 1
- Iteration 3: i = 2
- ... continuing ...
- Iteration 10: i = 9

So `i` takes values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

For `range(10)`:
Looking at the example, when a constant iterable is shown and the loop variable iterates across it, the iterable's state is represented by converting it to its list form and repeating it for each iteration. Since `range(10)` stays constant throughout all 10 iterations, and list(range(10)) = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], I should show this list representation repeated 10 times (matching the pattern from the example where t's list representation was repeated for each iteration).

So `range(10)` = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], ...] (10 times)

1 r , D , x = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( 10 ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 10 )=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]][/STATE]
3     x = r * x - D
4     print ( x )
