[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step:

0. Initial setup:
   - `string = "    jcmfxv     "` (4 spaces, "jcmfxv", 5 spaces = 15 characters)
   - `l = [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'j', 'c', 'm', 'f', 'x', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']`
   - Indices: 0-3 are spaces, 4-9 are 'jcmfxv', 10-14 are spaces
   - `len(l) = 15`
   - `range(len(l)) = range(15) = [0, 1, 2, ..., 14]`
   - `reversed(range(15))` will yield: [14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

1. Iteration 1: `i = 14`
   - `l[14] = ' '` (space)
   - `l[14] != ' '` is False, so skip break
   - `l.pop(14)` removes the last space

2. Iteration 2: `i = 13`
   - `l[13] = ' '` (space)
   - Condition is False, pop(13)

3. Iteration 3: `i = 12`
   - `l[12] = ' '` (space)
   - Condition is False, pop(12)

4. Iteration 4: `i = 11`
   - `l[11] = ' '` (space)
   - Condition is False, pop(11)

5. Iteration 5: `i = 10`
   - `l[10] = ' '` (space)
   - Condition is False, pop(10)

6. Iteration 6: `i = 9`
   - `l[9] = 'v'` (not a space!)
   - `l[9] != ' '` is True, execute break statement
   - Loop exits

Loop variable `i` takes values: [14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9] (6 iterations)

The iterable `reversed(range(len(l)))` is evaluated once at the start when `len(l) = 15`, creating an iterator over [14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. Since this doesn't change during the loop, it's repeated for each of the 6 iterations.
