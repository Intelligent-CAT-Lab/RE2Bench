Let me trace through the code with `text = ",wPzPppdl/"`.

The function uses a `for` loop: `for i in range(len(text)):`

First, I need to determine the length of text:
- `text = ",wPzPppdl/"` has 10 characters
- `len(text) = 10`
- `range(len(text)) = range(10)`

The loop will iterate 10 times with `i` taking values:
- Iteration 1: `i = 0`
- Iteration 2: `i = 1`
- Iteration 3: `i = 2`
- Iteration 4: `i = 3`
- Iteration 5: `i = 4`
- Iteration 6: `i = 5`
- Iteration 7: `i = 6`
- Iteration 8: `i = 7`
- Iteration 9: `i = 8`
- Iteration 10: `i = 9`

So `i` takes the values: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

For `range(len(text))`:
- This is the iterable that doesn't change throughout the loop
- `range(len(text)) = range(10)` which represents `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- Since it stays the same for all 10 iterations, I need to repeat this value 10 times
- According to the instructions, when a value stays the same through K iterations, repeat it K times

The representation should be a list of the value repeated for each iteration:
`[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]`
