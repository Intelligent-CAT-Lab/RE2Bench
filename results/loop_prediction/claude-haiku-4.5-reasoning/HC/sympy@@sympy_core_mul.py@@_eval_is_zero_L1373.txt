The loop at line 25 is:
```python
for a in self.args:
```

The input shows that `self` represents "pi/2". Since this is a method of the `Mul` class (which represents multiplication operations), the object must be a `Mul` instance.

For a `Mul` object representing `pi/2`:
- This represents the multiplication: `pi * (1/2)`
- The `args` property returns a tuple of the multiplicands
- In symbolic math systems (like SymPy), `pi/2` would be structured as `Mul(pi, Rational(1, 2))` or similar
- Thus, `self.args` is a tuple containing two elements: the symbol `pi` and `Rational(1, 2)` (representing 1/2)

Loop execution:
- The loop iterates over `self.args`, which has 2 elements
- Iteration 1: `a = pi` (the pi symbol, which is not zero and not infinite)
- Iteration 2: `a = Rational(1, 2)` (the rational number 1/2, which is not zero and not infinite)

Following the example format:
- `a` shows the sequence of values taken across iterations: `[pi, Rational(1,2)]`
- `self.args` is the iterable (constant across iterations), so it's repeated for each iteration: `[(pi, Rational(1,2)), (pi, Rational(1,2))]`
