[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` is called with `text="   "` (a string of three spaces).

1.  **Line 1:** `text` is `"   "`.
2.  **Line 2:** `text` is converted to a list of characters. `text` becomes `[' ', ' ', ' ']`. `len(text)` is `3`.
3.  **Line 3:** The `for` loop initializes. The iterable expression is `range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)`.
    *   `len(text)-1` is `2`.
    *   The range is `range(2, -1, -1)`.
    *   As a sequence, this range produces `[2, 1, 0]`.
    *   Based on the provided example where the string `t` was expanded into a list of its characters `['#', '2', '8', '4']` in the state annotation, the range object used as the loop iterable should also be represented as the list of values it yields: `[2, 1, 0]`. This value remains constant for the entire loop.
    *   The loop variable `i` will take values from this sequence in order: `2`, `1`, `0`.
    *   The loop runs 3 times.

    *   **Iteration 1:** `i` becomes `2`.
    *   **Iteration 2:** `i` becomes `1`.
    *   **Iteration 3:** `i` becomes `0`.

4.  **Loop Body (Lines 4-5):**
    *   For `i=2`: `text[2]` is `' '`. `isspace()` is True. `text[2]` becomes `'&nbsp;'`.
    *   For `i=1`: `text[1]` is `' '`. `isspace()` is True. `text[1]` becomes `'&nbsp;'`.
    *   For `i=0`: `text[0]` is `' '`. `isspace()` is True. `text[0]` becomes `'&nbsp;'`.
    *   (Note: `text` changes, but `text` is not being tracked in the requested annotations).

5.  **State Consolidation:**
    *   `i` states: `[2, 1, 0]`
    *   `range(...)` states: It behaves as the constant collection `[2, 1, 0]` for each of the 3 iterations. State list: `[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]]`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     text = list(text)
3     for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         if text[i].isspace():
5             text[i] = '&nbsp;'
6     return ''.join(text)
