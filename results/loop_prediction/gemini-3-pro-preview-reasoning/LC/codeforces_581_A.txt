[THOUGHT]
The code initializes a list `x` by splitting the input string "1 1".
`x` becomes `['1', '1']`.
The loop iterates using `range(len(x))`.
`len(x)` is 2. `range(2)` produces the sequence `0`, `1`. The list representation of this iterable is `[0, 1]`.

Loop Trace:
1.  **Iteration 1**:
    *   The loop variable `i` is assigned the first element of the range: `0`.
    *   The expression `range(len(x))` represents the loop source `[0, 1]`. Its state is `[0, 1]`.
    *   Line 3 executes: `x[0]` changes from `'1'` to `1`. `x` is `[1, '1']`.

2.  **Iteration 2**:
    *   The loop variable `i` is assigned the second element of the range: `1`.
    *   The expression `range(len(x))` remains constant as the loop source: `[0, 1]`.
    *   Line 3 executes: `x[1]` changes from `'1'` to `1`. `x` is `[1, 1]`.

The loop terminates after these two iterations.

Summary of States:
*   `i`: `[0, 1]`
*   `range(len(x))`: `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]` (The constant iterable value `[0, 1]` repeated for each iteration).

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
