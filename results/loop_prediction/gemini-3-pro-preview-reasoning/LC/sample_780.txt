[THOUGHT]
The function `f` receives a list of integers `ints`.
The input `ints` is `[2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`.

The loop inside `f` starts at line 4: `for i in ints:`.
We trace the iterations of this loop:

1.  **Iteration 1**: `i` is `2`. `ints` is `[2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`.
2.  **Iteration 2**: `i` is `3`. `ints` is unchanged.
3.  **Iteration 3**: `i` is `5`. `ints` is unchanged.
4.  **Iteration 4**: `i` is `2`. `ints` is unchanged.
5.  **Iteration 5**: `i` is `4`. `ints` is unchanged.
6.  **Iteration 6**: `i` is `5`. `ints` is unchanged.
7.  **Iteration 7**: `i` is `2`. `ints` is unchanged.
8.  **Iteration 8**: `i` is `89`. `ints` is unchanged.

The variable `i` tracks the current element of the list `ints`.
The variable `ints` remains constant throughout the loop.
