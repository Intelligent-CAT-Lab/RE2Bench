[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `nums=[7, 1, 2]` and `elements=[9, 0, 3]`.
Line 2 initializes `result` as an empty list.
Line 3 starts a loop: `for i in range(len(elements)):`.
- `len(elements)` is evaluated. `elements` has 3 items, so `len` is 3.
- `range(3)` creates a range object representing the sequence `0, 1, 2`. In the state annotations, iterables are typically expanded into their list representation (as seen with the string `t` in the example). So `range(len(elements))` corresponds to the list `[0, 1, 2]`. This value is constant for every iteration of the loop.
- The loop iterates 3 times.

Iteration 1:
- `i` takes the first value from the sequence: `0`.
- `nums` is `[7, 1, 2]`. `nums.pop()` returns `2`. `result` becomes `[2]`. `nums` becomes `[7, 1]`.

Iteration 2:
- `i` takes the second value: `1`.
- `nums` is `[7, 1]`. `nums.pop()` returns `1`. `result` becomes `[2, 1]`. `nums` becomes `[7]`.

Iteration 3:
- `i` takes the third value: `2`.
- `nums` is `[7]`. `nums.pop()` returns `7`. `result` becomes `[2, 1, 7]`. `nums` becomes `[]`.

The loop terminates.

Variables to annotate in Line 3:
`i`: Takes values `0`, `1`, `2` across the 3 iterations. State list: `[0, 1, 2]`.
`range(len(elements))`: Evaluates to `range(0, 3)`. Represented as a list `[0, 1, 2]`. It stays the same across 3 iterations. State list: `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]`.
