[THOUGHT]
1.  **Parse Input**: The input string is `2 100 105`. The line `r, D, x = map(int, input().split())` splits this string and converts elements to integers:
    *   `r = 2`
    *   `D = 100`
    *   `x = 105`

2.  **Analyze Loop Header**:
    *   Line 2: `for i in range(10):`
    *   The iterable expression is `range(10)`. Evaluated as a list/sequence, it contains integers from 0 to 9: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
    *   Consistent with the example (where a string iterable was represented as a list of its characters), `range(10)` is represented as a list of integers.
    *   The loop iterates 10 times. The value of `range(10)` does not change during the loop. So, its state is the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` repeated 10 times.

3.  **Trace Loop Variable `i`**:
    *   The variable `i` takes values from the iterable sequentially.
    *   Iteration 1: `i = 0`
    *   Iteration 2: `i = 1`
    *   ...
    *   Iteration 10: `i = 9`
    *   State for `i`: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

4.  **Verify Execution (Mental Check)**:
    *   `x` starts at 105.
    *   `i=0`: `x = 2*105 - 100 = 110`
    *   `i=1`: `x = 2*110 - 100 = 120`
    *   ...
    *   The loop runs without early exit for 10 iterations.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   Replace `[STATE]i=??[/STATE]` with `[STATE]i=[0, 1, ... 9][/STATE]`.
    *   Replace `[STATE]range ( 10 )=??[/STATE]` with `[STATE]range ( 10 )=[[0...9], [0...9], ...][/STATE]`.
