[THOUGHT]
The function `f(n)` is called with `n=1`.
On line 2, `streak` is initialized to `''`.
On line 3, the loop `for c in str(n):` iterates over the characters of the string representation of `n`.
`n` is 1, so `str(n)` evaluates to the string `"1"`.
The loop iterates once.

Iteration 1:
- The loop variable `c` takes the value of the first character of `"1"`, which is `'1'`.
- The expression `str(n)` evaluates to `"1"`.

The example provided shows that when iterating over a string `t="#284"`, `t`'s state was recorded as `[["#", "2", "8", "4"], ...]`. This implies that the iterable (container) string is represented as a list of its characters in the state annotations.
Following this pattern for `str(n)`:
- The value is `"1"`.
- Represented as a list of characters: `['1']`.
- Since the loop runs once, the state list for `str(n)` contains this value once: `[['1']]`.

For the loop variable `c`:
- The value is `'1'`.
- The state list for `c` contains this value once: `['1']`.

Inside the loop line 4:
`int(c)` is `1`.
`int(c) * 2` is `2`.
`c.ljust(2)` pads `'1'` with spaces to length 2 -> `'1 '`.
`streak` becomes `'1 '`.

The return value is `'1 '`.

State summary:
`c`: `['1']`
`str(n)`: `[['1']]` (Following the example's convention of expanding the string iterable to a list of characters)

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=['1'][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[['1']][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
