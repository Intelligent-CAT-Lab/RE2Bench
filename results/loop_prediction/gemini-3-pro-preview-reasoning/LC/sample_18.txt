[THOUGHT]
The function iterates through list `l`, which is a copy of the input `array` initialized to `[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
In the first iteration, `i` is 3. Since 3 is not greater than the `elem` (3), the loop continues.
In the second iteration, `i` is 5. Since 5 is greater than 3, the code executes the insertion logic and breaks out of the loop.
Therefore, the loop runs exactly twice, capturing the state of `i` and `l` for these two steps.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
