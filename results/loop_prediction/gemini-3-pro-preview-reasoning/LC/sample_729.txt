The function `f(s1, s2)` finds all occurrences of substring `s2` inside `s1` searching backwards from the end, and returns a list containing the indices of the *last* character of each match.

Input:
`s1` = "abcdefghabc"
`s2` = "abc"

Tracing the code:
1.  **Line 3**: `i = s1.rfind(s2)`
    *   `s1` is "abcdefghabc".
    *   `s2` occurs at index 0 ("abc...") and index 8 ("...abc").
    *   `rfind` returns the highest index, so `i` = 8.

2.  **Line 4 (Iteration 1)**: `while i != -1:`
    *   `i` is 8. Condition `8 != -1` is True.
    *   We enter the loop. This is the first state to record for `i`.
    *   Current list of states: `i` = [8].

3.  **Line 5**: `res.append(i+len(s2)-1)`
    *   `len(s2)` is 3.
    *   Appends `8 + 3 - 1` = 10 to `res`.

4.  **Line 6**: `i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)`
    *   `i` is currently 8.
    *   Searches for `s2` ("abc") in `s1` within the slice `s1[0:8]`.
    *   `s1[0:8]` is "abcdefgh".
    *   "abc" is found at index 0.
    *   `i` becomes 0.

5.  **Line 4 (Iteration 2)**: `while i != -1:`
    *   `i` is 0. Condition `0 != -1` is True.
    *   We enter the loop.
    *   Current list of states: `i` = [8, 0].

6.  **Line 5**: `res.append(i+len(s2)-1)`
    *   Appends `0 + 3 - 1` = 2 to `res`.

7.  **Line 6**: `i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)`
    *   `i` is currently 0.
    *   Searches for `s2` ("abc") in `s1` within the slice `s1[0:0]`.
    *   `s1[0:0]` is an empty string "".
    *   "abc" is not found.
    *   `i` becomes -1.

8.  **Line 4 (Iteration 3)**: `while i != -1:`
    *   `i` is -1. Condition `-1 != -1` is False.
    *   Loop terminates.

The variable `i` took the values 8 and 0 at the start of the loop iterations.
