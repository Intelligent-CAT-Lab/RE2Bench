[THOUGHT]
The function `change_base` is called with input arguments `x = 4` and `base = 5`.
We trace the execution:
1.  **Initialization**: `ret = ""` (line 3).
2.  **While Loop (line 4)**: checks `x > 0`.
    *   **Iteration 1**:
        *   Current value of `x` is 4.
        *   Condition `4 > 0` is `True`.
        *   We record the state: `x` = 4.
        *   Line 5: `ret = str(4 % 5) + ""` -> `ret = "4"`.
        *   Line 6: `x = 4 // 5` -> `x = 0`.
    *   **Iteration 2 (check only)**:
        *   Current value of `x` is 0.
        *   Condition `0 > 0` is `False`.
        *   Loop terminates.

The variable `x` at the loop condition line corresponds to the successful iterations. Since the loop runs only once, the state list contains a single element.
State for `x`: `[4]`.
