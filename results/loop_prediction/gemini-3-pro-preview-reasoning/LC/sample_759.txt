[THOUGHT]
The function `f` searches for all occurrences of substring `sub` within `text` and returns their starting indices. The loop uses the variable `starting` to track the current search position.

Input:
`text` = "egmdartoa"
`sub` = "good"

Trace:
1.  **Initialization**:
    - `index = []`
    - `starting = 0`

2.  **Loop Iteration 1**:
    - Line 4 (`while starting != -1`): Current value of `starting` is `0`. 
        - Condition `0 != -1` is True.
        - **State recorded**: `0`.
    - Line 5 (`starting = text.find(sub, starting)`):
        - `text.find("good", 0)` is called.
        - The substring "good" is NOT found in "egmdartoa".
        - `find` returns `-1`.
        - `starting` becomes `-1`.
    - Line 6 (`if starting != -1`): `-1 != -1` is False.
    - Line 8 is skipped.

3.  **Loop Iteration 2**:
    - Line 4 (`while starting != -1`): Current value of `starting` is `-1`.
        - Condition `-1 != -1` is False.
        - **State recorded**: `-1`.
    - The loop terminates.

The sequence of states for `starting` at the beginning of the `while` loop is `[0, -1]`.

1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0, -1][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
