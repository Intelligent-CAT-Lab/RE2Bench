[THOUGHT]
The function `f` iterates through a loop determined by `num_applies`, which is initialized to 2.
The loop statement is `for i in range(num_applies):`.
`num_applies` is 2, so `range(num_applies)` yields the sequence `[0, 1]`.
The loop runs 2 times.
In the first iteration, `i` is 0. The iterable `range(num_applies)` represents the sequence `[0, 1]`.
In the second iteration, `i` is 1. The iterable `range(num_applies)` remains `[0, 1]`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, chars):
2     num_applies = 2
3     extra_chars = ''
4     for i in range(num_applies):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(num_applies)=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
5         extra_chars += chars
6         text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
7     return text
