[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list of lists `ls` and an integer `n`.
The input `ls` is `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
The input `n` is `1`.

The loop `for i in ls:` iterates over each sublist in `ls`.

**Iteration 1:**
- `ls` is `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
- `i` takes the value of the first element: `[1, 9, 4]`.
- Inside the loop, `i[0]` is `1`. `1 == 1` is True. `answer` is updated to `[1, 9, 4]`.

**Iteration 2:**
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
- `i` takes the value of the second element: `[83, 0, 5]`.
- Inside the loop, `i[0]` is `83`. `83 == 1` is False.

**Iteration 3:**
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
- `i` takes the value of the third element: `[9, 6, 100]`.
- Inside the loop, `i[0]` is `9`. `9 == 1` is False.

The loop finishes.
Variable `i` sequence: `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
Variable `ls` sequence: `[[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]]`.
