[THOUGHT]
The input `string` is `"    jcmfxv     "`.
`l` is initialized as a list of characters of `string`. The length `len(l)` is 15.
The loop iterates using `reversed(range(15))`, which generates the sequence: `14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0`.
Trace of loop:
1. `i` = 14. `l[14]` is ' ' (tail space). Logic pops index 14.
2. `i` = 13. `l[13]` is ' ' (tail space). Logic pops index 13.
3. `i` = 12. `l[12]` is ' ' (tail space). Logic pops index 12.
4. `i` = 11. `l[11]` is ' ' (tail space). Logic pops index 11.
5. `i` = 10. `l[10]` is ' ' (tail space). Logic pops index 10.
6. `i` = 9. `l[9]` is 'v' (last char of "jcmfxv"). Condition `l[i] != ' '` is True. `break` is executed.

The loop runs 6 times.
State of `i`: `[14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9]`.
State of `reversed(range(len(l)))`: This expression evaluates to the iterator over the range. Following the example where the iterable `t` was represented as its full sequence `["#", "2", "8", "4"]` repeatedly, I will represent the `reversed` iterator as the list `[14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`. It is repeated 6 times.
