[THOUGHT]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. 
The initial input values are `a = 10` and `b = 15`.

Let's trace the execution of the `while b:` loop step by step:

1. **First Iteration Check**:
   - Current value of `b` is 15.
   - The condition `while b` (which checks if `b != 0`) is true (15 != 0).
   - We record the state of `b` at the beginning of the loop check: **15**.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `a, b = b, a % b`
     - New `a` becomes the old `b` (15).
     - New `b` becomes the old `a` % old `b` (10 % 15 = 10).
   - State after update: `a = 15`, `b = 10`.

2. **Second Iteration Check**:
   - Current value of `b` is 10.
   - The condition `while b` is true (10 != 0).
   - We record the state of `b`: **10**.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `a, b = b, a % b`
     - New `a` becomes the old `b` (10).
     - New `b` becomes the old `a` % old `b` (15 % 10 = 5).
   - State after update: `a = 10`, `b = 5`.

3. **Third Iteration Check**:
   - Current value of `b` is 5.
   - The condition `while b` is true (5 != 0).
   - We record the state of `b`: **5**.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `a, b = b, a % b`
     - New `a` becomes the old `b` (5).
     - New `b` becomes the old `a` % old `b` (10 % 5 = 0).
   - State after update: `a = 5`, `b = 0`.

4. **Fourth Iteration Check**:
   - Current value of `b` is 0.
   - The condition `while b` is false (0 is falsy).
   - We record the state of `b`: **0**.
   - The loop terminates.

The sequence of states for `b` at the loop check is `[15, 10, 5, 0]`.
