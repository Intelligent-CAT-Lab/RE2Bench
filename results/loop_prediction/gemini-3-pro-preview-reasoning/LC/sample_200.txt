[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes `text` ("jao mt") and `value` ("house") as input.
`length` is initialized to `len("jao mt")`, which is 6.
`index` is initialized to 0.

The `while` loop continues as long as `length > 0`. The marker is at the beginning of the loop check.

Iteration 1:
- `length` is 6. Condition `6 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 6.
- `value` becomes `text[0]` ('j') + "house" = "jhouse".
- `length` becomes 5.
- `index` becomes 1.

Iteration 2:
- `length` is 5. Condition `5 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 5.
- `value` becomes `text[1]` ('a') + "jhouse" = "ajhouse".
- `length` becomes 4.
- `index` becomes 2.

Iteration 3:
- `length` is 4. Condition `4 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 4.
- `value` becomes `text[2]` ('o') + "ajhouse" = "oajhouse".
- `length` becomes 3.
- `index` becomes 3.

Iteration 4:
- `length` is 3. Condition `3 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 3.
- `value` becomes `text[3]` (' ') + "oajhouse" = " oajhouse".
- `length` becomes 2.
- `index` becomes 4.

Iteration 5:
- `length` is 2. Condition `2 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 2.
- `value` becomes `text[4]` ('m') + " oajhouse" = "m oajhouse".
- `length` becomes 1.
- `index` becomes 5.

Iteration 6:
- `length` is 1. Condition `1 > 0` is True.
- State `length` = 1.
- `value` becomes `text[5]` ('t') + "m oajhouse" = "tm oajhouse".
- `length` becomes 0.
- `index` becomes 6.

Iteration 7:
- `length` is 0. Condition `0 > 0` is False. Loop terminates.

The recorded states for `length` at line 4 are `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

1 def f(text, value):
2     length = len(text)
3     index = 0
4     while length > 0:## [STATE]length=[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE]
5         value = text[index] + value
6         length -= 1
7         index += 1
8     return value
