[THOUGHT]
The function `sum_squares` receives the list `lst` = `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
The loop `for i in lst` iterates over each element of the list.

Iteration 1:
- `i` becomes the first element: `-1.4`.
- `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.

Iteration 2:
- `i` becomes the second element: `17.9`.
- `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.

Iteration 3:
- `i` becomes the third element: `18.9`.
- `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.

Iteration 4:
- `i` becomes the fourth element: `19.9`.
- `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.

The loop finishes.
We collect the states for `i` and `lst` across the iterations.
`i`: `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`
`lst`: Repeated 4 times.
