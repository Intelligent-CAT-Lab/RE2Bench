[THOUGHT]
The loop `for text in items` iterates over the input list `items`.
The input `items` is a list of 5 strings: `[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"]`.
The loop runs 5 times.
During each iteration, the variable `text` takes the value of the current string from the list. 
The variable `items` remains the constant list `[" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"]` throughout all iterations.
The state for `text` is a list collecting the value of `text` at each step.
The state for `items` is a list collecting the value of `items` at each step (which is the same list repeated 5 times).
