[THOUGHT]
The function `make_a_pile(n)` is called with `n=3`.
The code contains a list comprehension: `[n + 2*i for i in range(n)]`.
We need to determine the state of `i` and `range(n)` during the iterations of this comprehension.

1.  **Analyze `range(n)`**:
    *   With `n=3`, `range(n)` evaluates to `range(0, 3)`.
    *   In the provided example, the iterable `t` (a string) was represented as a list of its elements (characters). Applying this pattern to `range(n)`, we represent it as a list of its integers: `[0, 1, 2]`.
    *   This expression evaluates once before the loop starts and stays constant for all iterations.
    *   Since the loop runs 3 times, we repeat this state 3 times.

2.  **Analyze `i`**:
    *   The loop iterates over the values produced by `range(0, 3)`.
    *   Iteration 1: `i` takes the value `0`.
    *   Iteration 2: `i` takes the value `1`.
    *   Iteration 3: `i` takes the value `2`.
    *   So, the state of `i` across the iterations is `[0, 1, 2]`.

3.  **Construct State Lists**:
    *   `i` -> `[0, 1, 2]`
    *   `range(n)` -> `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]`

4.  **Format Output**:
    *   Replace `??` in `[STATE]i=??[/STATE]` with `[0, 1, 2]`.
    *   Replace `??` in `[STATE]range(n)=??[/STATE]` with `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]`.
