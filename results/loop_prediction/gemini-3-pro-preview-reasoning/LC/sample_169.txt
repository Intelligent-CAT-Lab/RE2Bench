[THOUGHT]
The input `text` is "taole".
Line 2: `ls = list(text)` becomes `['t', 'a', 'o', 'l', 'e']`.
Line 3: `total = (len(text) - 1) * 2`. `len("taole")` is 5. `total` is (5-1)*2 = 8.
Line 4: `for i in range(1, total+1):`
`range(1, total+1)` becomes `range(1, 9)`. Following the pattern in the example where the iterable `t` (string) was expanded to a list of characters, `range(1, 9)` is expanded to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
The loop iterates `i` from 1 to 8.
Iterations:
1. `i`=1. `ls` appends '+'.
2. `i`=2. `ls` inserts '+' at 0.
3. `i`=3. `ls` appends '+'.
4. `i`=4. `ls` inserts '+' at 0.
5. `i`=5. `ls` appends '+'.
6. `i`=6. `ls` inserts '+' at 0.
7. `i`=7. `ls` appends '+'.
8. `i`=8. `ls` inserts '+' at 0.

States for `i`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
States for `range(1, total+1)`: The value is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` (the sequence being iterated). This stays constant for all 8 iterations.
