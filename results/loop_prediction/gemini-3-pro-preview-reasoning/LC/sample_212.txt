[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums`.
The input `nums` is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
The length of `nums` is 7.
The loop iterates over `range(len(nums) - 1)`, which is `range(6)`.
The sequence of values produced by `range(6)` is `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
The loop runs 6 times.

Variable `_` (the loop iterator):
It takes the values `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5` in sequential iterations.

Variable `range(len(nums) - 1)` (the iterable expression):
This expression evaluates to a range object corresponding to the sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
Based on the provided example where the string iterable `t` was expanded into a list of its characters `["#", "2", "8", "4"]`, the range object should be expanded into a list of its integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
Since the iterable object does not change during the loop, this state is repeated for all 6 iterations.

Loop Trace:
Iteration 1: `_` = 0
Iteration 2: `_` = 1
Iteration 3: `_` = 2
Iteration 4: `_` = 3
Iteration 5: `_` = 4
Iteration 6: `_` = 5

Construction of state lists:
`_`: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
`range(len(nums) - 1)`: `[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]`
