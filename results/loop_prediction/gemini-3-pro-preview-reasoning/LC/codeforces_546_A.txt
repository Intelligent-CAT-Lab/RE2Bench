[THOUGHT]
The code initializes variables `k`, `n`, and `w` from the input `1 1 1`. A loop iterates from 1 to `w + 1`. Since `w` is 1, the loop runs exactly once with `i` taking the value 1. The state of `i` is recorded for this single iteration, and the range object is represented as a list containing the single element `1`.

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[1]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
