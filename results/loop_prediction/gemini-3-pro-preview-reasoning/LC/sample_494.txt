[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `num` and an integer `l`.
Input:
`num` = "1"
`l` = 3

Initialization:
`t` = ""

The logic enters a `while` loop with condition `l > len(num)`. `len(num)` is 1.

Iteration 1:
Current values: `l` = 3, `num` = "1".
Condition check: `3 > 1` is True.
State recorded: `l` is 3, `num` is "1".
Inside loop:
`t` becomes "0".
`l` becomes `3 - 1` = 2.

Iteration 2:
Current values: `l` = 2, `num` = "1".
Condition check: `2 > 1` is True.
State recorded: `l` is 2, `num` is "1".
Inside loop:
`t` becomes "00".
`l` becomes `2 - 1` = 1.

Iteration 3:
Current values: `l` = 1, `num` = "1".
Condition check: `1 > 1` is False.
Loop terminates.

The variable states captured are for the iterations where the loop body is executed.
`l`: `[3, 2]`
`num`: `["1", "1"]`

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
