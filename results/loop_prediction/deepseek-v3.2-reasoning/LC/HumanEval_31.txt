[THOUGHT]
Given n = 13441, which is prime. The code checks if n is prime by iterating k from 2 to n-2 (since range(2, n-1) generates numbers from 2 to n-2 inclusive). Here, n-1 = 13440, so range(2, 13440) generates k values from 2 to 13339. Since n is prime, n % k != 0 for all k in this range, so the loop completes all iterations without early exit. Thus, k takes all integer values from 2 to 13339 in order, totaling 13338 iterations. The range(2, n-1) object remains constant throughout the loop, so its state is the same for each iteration. Therefore, for the state of k, replace ?? with a list of integers from 2 to 13339. For the state of range(2, n-1), replace ?? with a list where the range object range(2, 13440) is repeated 13338 times, once per iteration. Due to the large number of iterations, ellipsis is used to represent the full lists compactly.
