[THOUGHT]
The input provides `nums` = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51] and `target` = 5. The loop iterates over each element in `nums` in order. The loop variable `i` takes on each value from `nums` sequentially: 12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51. The list `nums` remains unchanged throughout the loop. Since there are 7 iterations, we need to record the state of `i` as a list of its 7 values, and the state of `nums` as a list containing 7 copies of the original `nums` list.
