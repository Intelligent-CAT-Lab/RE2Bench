[THOUGHT]
We are given a function `greatest_common_divisor` with arguments `a=10` and `b=15`. We need to trace the while loop and determine the value of `b` each time the condition `while b:` is evaluated (i.e., at the start of each iteration). The loop will run as long as `b` is non-zero.

Initial values: `a=10`, `b=15`.
- First iteration: Condition checked with `b=15` (true). Inside loop: `a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 15`, `b = 10 % 15 = 10`.
- Second iteration: Condition checked with `b=10` (true). Inside loop: `a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 10`, `b = 15 % 10 = 5`.
- Third iteration: Condition checked with `b=5` (true). Inside loop: `a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 5`, `b = 10 % 5 = 0`.
- Fourth iteration: Condition checked with `b=0` (false), loop exits.

The loop body executes three times, so `b` takes the values `15`, `10`, and `5` at the start of each iteration. The final check with `b=0` does not result in an iteration, so it is not included in the state list.

[ANSWER]
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b:## [STATE]b=[15, 10, 5][/STATE]
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
