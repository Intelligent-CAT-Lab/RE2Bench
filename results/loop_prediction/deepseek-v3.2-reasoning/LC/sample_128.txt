[THOUGHT]
The input text is "Mammoth". The loop iterates over enumerate(text), which yields pairs (index, character). The string has 7 characters. 
Iteration details:
- i=0, c='M'
- i=1, c='a'
- i=2, c='m'
- i=3, c='m'
- i=4, c='o'
- i=5, c='t'
- i=6, c='h'
Thus, the state of i across iterations is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]. The state of c is ['M','a','m','m','o','t','h'].
For enumerate(text), it is an iterator that remains the same object throughout the loop. Its value, when converted to a list, is [(0,'M'), (1,'a'), (2,'m'), (3,'m'), (4,'o'), (5,'t'), (6,'h')]. Since it does not change per iteration, we repeat this list for each of the 7 iterations.
