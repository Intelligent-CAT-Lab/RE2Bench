[THOUGHT]
Given n = 3, reversed(range(n)) produces an iterator yielding 2, 1, 0. The loop iterates:
- First iteration: i = 2, condition n % i == 0 (3 % 2 = 1) is false.
- Second iteration: i = 1, condition 3 % 1 == 0 is true, so function returns 1.
Thus, the loop executes exactly 2 times. The variable i takes values [2, 1]. The expression reversed(range(n)) is constant and can be represented as the list [2, 1, 0]. Since there are 2 iterations, its state is repeated twice.

[ANSWER]
1 def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
2 
3     for i in reversed(range(n)):## [STATE]i=[2,1][/STATE] [STATE]reversed(range(n))=[[2,1,0], [2,1,0]][/STATE]
4         if n % i == 0:
5             return i
