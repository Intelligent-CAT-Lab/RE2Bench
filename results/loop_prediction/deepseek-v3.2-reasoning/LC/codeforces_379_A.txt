[THOUGHT]
Given input "80 970", we have a=80, b=970.
After line 2: x = a = 80.
First while loop condition: while x > 0. The loop will run exactly 80 times because x decrements from 80 to 1. At each iteration, before entering the loop body, the value of x is: 
Iteration 1: x=80
Iteration 2: x=79
...
Iteration 80: x=1
So the state list for 'x' is all integers from 80 down to 1.

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 x = a
3 h = 0
4 s = 0
5 while x > 0 :## [STATE]['x']=[80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE]
6     x -= 1
7     h += 1
8     s += 1
9 while s // b != 0 :
10     h += 1
11     s = s - b + 1
12 print ( h )
