[THOUGHT]
Input: `f = [2]` and `K = "ZZ"`. The method `dup_abs` contains a list comprehension: `[ K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f ]`. This is a loop where `coeff` iterates over each element in `f`. Since `f` is a list with one element `2`, the loop has only one iteration. In this iteration, `coeff` takes the value `2`. Therefore, the state of `coeff` during the loop is a list with one element: `[2]`.
