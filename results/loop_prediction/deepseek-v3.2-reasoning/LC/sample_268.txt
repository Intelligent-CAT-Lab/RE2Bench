[THOUGHT]
Given s = "h grateful k" and separator = " ", we compute len(s) = 12, so range(len(s)) produces values from 0 to 11. The loop iterates over i in this range but breaks early when a space is found. On iteration 1: i = 0, s[0] = 'h' != ' ', condition false. On iteration 2: i = 1, s[1] = ' ' == separator, condition true, so the loop body executes and returns, stopping further iterations. Thus, the loop runs for two iterations with i values 0 and 1. The expression range(len(s)) is constant, so its state per iteration is the same range converted to a list. Converting range(0,12) to a list gives [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Since there are two iterations, we repeat this list twice.

2     for i in range(len(s)):## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(s))=[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]][/STATE]

5             new_s[i] = '/'
6             return ' '.join(new_s)
