[THOUGHT]
The input list is `lst = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`. The loop iterates four times. In each iteration, `i` takes the value of each element in order: -1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9. The variable `lst` remains unchanged throughout, so its value is repeated for each iteration. Thus, `i` state is `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]` and `lst` state is `[[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]]`.
