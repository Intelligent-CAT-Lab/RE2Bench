[THOUGHT]
Input: "2 100 105" yields r=2, D=100, x=105.
The loop iterates 10 times with i taking values from 0 to 9 sequentially.
range(10) is a constant iterable, so its value is repeated for each iteration.
Following the example's representation for a constant iterable, range(10) is shown as a list of its elements [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] repeated 10 times.

1 r , D , x = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( 10 ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 10 )=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]][/STATE]
