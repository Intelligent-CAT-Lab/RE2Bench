[THOUGHT]
Input a = [5,5,5,6,4,9]. len(a) = 6, so len(a)-1 = 5. The range is range(0,5,2), which yields values 0, 2, 4. So the loop iterates three times with k taking values 0, 2, and 4. Thus, the state of k across iterations is [0, 2, 4]. The range expression is evaluated once and remains constant throughout the loop. Its value is range(0,5,2), which as a list is [0,2,4]. Since it stays the same for all three iterations, we repeat this list three times: [[0,2,4], [0,2,4], [0,2,4]].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(a):
2     b = a.copy()
3     for k in range(0, len(a) - 1, 2):## [STATE]k=[0,2,4][/STATE] [STATE]range(0, len(a) - 1, 2)=[[0,2,4], [0,2,4], [0,2,4]][/STATE]
4         b.insert(k + 1, b[k])
5     b.append(b[0])
6     return b
