[THOUGHT]
The input nums is [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3], so len(nums) = 7, and len(nums) - 1 = 6. Therefore, range(len(nums) - 1) evaluates to range(6), which yields the values 0,1,2,3,4,5.

The for loop iterates 6 times, with _ taking the values 0,1,2,3,4,5 in order. So the state of _ is [0,1,2,3,4,5].

The expression range(len(nums) - 1) is evaluated at the start and does not change during the loop, as nums is modified in place but its length remains 7. Therefore, for each iteration, the value of range(len(nums) - 1) is the same, i.e., range(6). Representing range(6) as a list [0,1,2,3,4,5], the state for range(len(nums) - 1) is a list of this value repeated for each iteration: [[0,1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5]].
