[THOUGHT]
Given input n=1259, x=3, y=52.
- n != 1, so skip the first if.
- Enter the for loop: range(2, n) generates integers from 2 to 1258 inclusive.
- Since 1259 is prime, no divisor i in that range satisfies n % i == 0.
- Therefore, the loop runs to completion over all i from 2 to 1258.
- Thus, variable i takes each value from 2 to 1258 exactly once.
- The state of i is the list of these values: [2, 3, 4, ..., 1258].
- The expression range(2, n) evaluates to range(2, 1259), which remains constant throughout the loop.
- The loop iterates 1257 times (from 2 to 1258 inclusive), so range(2, n)'s state is repeated 1257 times.
- Represent range(2, n) as a list: list(range(2, 1259)) = [2, 3, ..., 1258].
- Then repeat this list 1257 times to match the number of iterations.
