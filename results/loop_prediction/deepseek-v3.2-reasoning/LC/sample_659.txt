[THOUGHT]
The input bots is a list of four strings: ["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"].
The loop iterates over each string in order.
Thus, the state of username during the loop is: ["yR?TAJhIW?n", "o11BgEFDfoe", "KnHdn2vdEd", "wvwruuqfhXbGis"].
The variable bots remains unchanged throughout the loop, so its state is repeated for each of the 4 iterations: it is the original list repeated 4 times.

6     return len(clean)
