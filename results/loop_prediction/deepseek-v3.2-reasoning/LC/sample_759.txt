[THOUGHT]
The input text is "egmdartoa" and sub is "good". The function `f` finds all occurrences of `sub` in `text`. Initially, `starting` is set to 0. The while loop condition checks if `starting != -1`. In the first iteration, `starting` is 0, so the loop enters. At the start of the iteration, `starting = 0`. Then, `text.find(sub, starting)` is called. Since "good" does not appear in "egmdartoa", `find` returns -1. So `starting` becomes -1. The if condition is false, so nothing is appended and `starting` is not incremented. The loop condition is checked again: `starting != -1` is false, so the loop terminates. The loop runs only once, and the value of `starting` at the beginning of that iteration is 0.

1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
