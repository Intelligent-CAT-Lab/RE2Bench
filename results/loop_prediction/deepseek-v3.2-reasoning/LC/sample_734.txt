[THOUGHT]
The input `nums` is `[5, 3, 3, 7]`. The length of `nums` is 4, so `len(nums) - 2` equals 2. The range expression `range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)` evaluates to `range(2, -1, -1)`, which yields the sequence `[2, 1, 0]` when iterated.

The loop executes three times. In each iteration:
- First iteration: `i = 2`. `nums[2]` is 3, which is odd, so the condition `nums[i] % 2 == 0` is false, and no removal occurs.
- Second iteration: `i = 1`. `nums[1]` is 3, odd, condition false, no removal.
- Third iteration: `i = 0`. `nums[0]` is 5, odd, condition false, no removal.

Thus, `nums` remains unchanged as `[5, 3, 3, 7]` throughout the loop. The variable `i` takes the values `[2, 1, 0]` in order. The range expression `range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)` is constant and evaluates to the list `[2, 1, 0]`. Since it does not change during the loop, its state is repeated for each of the three iterations.

2     for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
3         if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
4             nums.remove(nums[i])
5     return nums
