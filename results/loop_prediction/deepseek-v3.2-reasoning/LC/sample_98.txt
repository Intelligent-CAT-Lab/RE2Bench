[THOUGHT]
Input string s = "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!". Split gives list: ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"].
The list comprehension iterates over each word. Loop variable s takes each word in order: "SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!".
s.split() evaluates once to ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"] and stays constant across 5 iterations.
So state of s is list of its values. State of s.split() is list of 5 copies of the split list.

1 def f(s):
2     return sum([s.istitle() for s in s.split()])## [STATE]s=["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"][/STATE] [STATE]s.split()=[["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"], ["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"]][/STATE]
