[THOUGHT]
The input string is "Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#". After converting to a list, it has 28 characters. The loop runs 28 times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 27. The expression `range(len(text))` evaluates to `range(28)`, which produces the numbers 0 through 27. Since this expression does not change during the loop, its state is repeated for each iteration.
