[THOUGHT]
The input provides `ls` as [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]] and `n` as 1. The function `f` iterates over each element `i` in `ls`. The loop runs three times:
- First iteration: `i` = [1,9,4]
- Second iteration: `i` = [83,0,5]
- Third iteration: `i` = [9,6,100]

The variable `ls` remains constant throughout, with value [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]]. For the state annotations:
- `i` changes each iteration, so its state is the list of values: [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]].
- `ls` stays the same for all iterations, so its state is repeated three times: [ [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]], [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]], [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]] ].
