[THOUGHT]
Given n=1, str(n) evaluates to '1'. The loop iterates over each character in this string, so there is exactly one iteration. In that iteration, c takes the value '1'. The variable str(n) remains constant at '1' throughout. According to the instructions, we represent c's state as a list of its values: ['1']. For str(n), we repeat its value (converted to a list of characters for consistency with the example) for each iteration, resulting in a list with one element: [['1']].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=['1'][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[['1']][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
