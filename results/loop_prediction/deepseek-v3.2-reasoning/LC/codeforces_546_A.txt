[THOUGHT]
Input: "1 1 1" yields k=1, n=1, w=1.
The loop runs for i in range(1, w+1) = range(1,2), which produces a single iteration with i=1.
So the state of i during the loop is [1].
The expression range(1, w+1) evaluates to range(1,2), which is constant throughout the loop. Representing it as a list gives [1]. Since there is one iteration, we repeat its value once: [[1]].

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[[1]][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
