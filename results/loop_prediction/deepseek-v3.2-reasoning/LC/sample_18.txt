[THOUGHT]
We have input: array = [3,5,4,3,2,1,0], elem = 3.
Line 2: k = 0.
Line 3: l = array.copy() = [3,5,4,3,2,1,0].
We then enter a for loop over l.
Iteration 1: i = 3. Check condition i > elem: 3 > 3 is false. So skip the if block. Then k becomes 1.
Iteration 2: i = 5. Check condition i > elem: 5 > 3 is true. Then we insert elem at index k=1 into array. array becomes [3,3,5,4,3,2,1,0]. Then break.
So the loop runs 2 iterations.
Thus i takes values: 3, 5.
l remains the same list [3,5,4,3,2,1,0] throughout both iterations.
Therefore, we replace ?? for i with [3, 5] and for l with [[3,5,4,3,2,1,0], [3,5,4,3,2,1,0]].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
