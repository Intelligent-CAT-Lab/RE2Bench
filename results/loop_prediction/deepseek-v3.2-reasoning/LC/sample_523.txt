[THOUGHT]
The input text is "   ". After converting to list, text becomes [' ', ' ', ' ']. The loop iterates over i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1) which is range(2, -1, -1), yielding i values 2, 1, 0 in order. So i state is [2, 1, 0]. The range expression is computed once and does not change; its value is range(2, -1, -1), which we represent as the list [2, 1, 0]. Since there are 3 iterations, we repeat this list 3 times for the state of the range expression.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     text = list(text)
3     for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)=[[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         if text[i].isspace():
5             text[i] = '&nbsp;'
6     return ''.join(text)
