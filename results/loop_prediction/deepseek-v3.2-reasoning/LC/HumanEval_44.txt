[THOUGHT]
Given input: x=4, base=5.
Initialize ret = "".
While loop condition: x>0.
First iteration: x=4, condition true. Execute body: ret = str(4 % 5) + "" = "4". Then x //= 5 => x = 0.
Second check: x=0, condition false, exit loop.
The loop runs for one iteration. The variable x at the start of the iteration is 4. So the state of x for the loop is [4].

3     ret = ""
4     while x > 0:## [STATE]x=[4][/STATE]
5         ret = str(x % base) + ret
6         x //= base
7     return ret
