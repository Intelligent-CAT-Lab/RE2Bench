[THOUGHT]
From the input, n = 199996, so int(n) = 199996. The loop iterates over i from 1 to 199996 inclusive. Therefore, the state of i is a list of integers from 1 to 199996: [1, 2, 3, ..., 199996]. The expression range(1, int(n)+1) evaluates to range(1, 199997), which is constant throughout the loop. Since its value does not change, for each of the 199996 iterations, its state is the same. To represent it as a list, each element can be the list of integers generated by the range, i.e., [1, 2, 3, ..., 199996]. Thus, the state is a list of 199996 identical lists, each being [1, 2, 3, ..., 199996]. Due to the large size, compact notation with ellipsis is used for readability.

1 from decimal import Decimal , getcontext
2 getcontext ( ) . prec = 200
3 n , d , x = map ( Decimal , input ( ) . split ( ) )
4 ans = 0
5 for i in range ( 1 , int ( n ) + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, ..., 199996][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , int ( n ) + 1 )=[[1, 2, 3, ..., 199996], [1, 2, 3, ..., 199996], ..., [1, 2, 3, ..., 199996]][/STATE]
6     i = Decimal ( str ( i ) )
7     ans += Decimal ( str ( ( int ( n ) - int ( i ) + 1 ) ) ) / Decimal ( str ( i ) ) * ( d + x * Decimal ( str ( int ( n ) * 2 - 1 ) ) / Decimal ( "2" ) )
8 print ( ans )
