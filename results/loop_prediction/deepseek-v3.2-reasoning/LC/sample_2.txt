[THOUGHT]
The input text is "hbtofdeiequ". The function converts it to a list of characters. The loop iterates over the string '+', which contains only one character '+'. So there is one iteration with i = '+'. The condition checks if '+' is in new_text, but new_text contains only letters, so it's false. Thus, the state of i is ['+'].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     for i in '+':## [STATE]i=['+'][/STATE]
4         if i in new_text:
5             new_text.remove(i)
6     return ''.join(new_text)
