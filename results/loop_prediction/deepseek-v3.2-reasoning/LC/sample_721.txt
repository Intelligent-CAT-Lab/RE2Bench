[THOUGHT]
First, from the input, nums is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2], so len(nums) = 5, thus count = 5. The loop for num in range(2, count) uses range(2,5), which generates values 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the loop iterates three times. In each iteration:
- Iteration 1: num = 2, and range(2, count) is range(2,5), which can be represented as [2,3,4].
- Iteration 2: num = 3, and range(2, count) is still range(2,5), represented as [2,3,4].
- Iteration 3: num = 4, and range(2, count) remains range(2,5), represented as [2,3,4].
Thus, the state of 'num' is [2,3,4], and since 'range(2, count)' is constant across iterations, its state is a list with three identical elements, each being [2,3,4].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     count = len(nums)
3     for num in range(2, count):## [STATE]num=[2,3,4][/STATE] [STATE]range(2, count)=[[2,3,4], [2,3,4], [2,3,4]][/STATE]
4         nums.sort()
5     return nums
