[THOUGHT]  
The input `marks` is a dictionary. The loop iterates over `marks.values()`. The values in the dictionary are:  
1. 67  
2. 89  
3. 4  
4. 11  
5. 72  
6. 83  

So `value` in each iteration will be: 67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83.  

`marks.values()` in Python returns a view object, but we can think of it as a sequence of values. Since the loop runs 6 times, `marks.values()` should be the same for each iteration (the view object itself doesn't change, but its content is a fixed list of values).  

We need to replace `??` with lists:  
- For `value`: `[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]`  
- For `marks.values()`: repeat the same list of values for each iteration: `[[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], ...]` (6 times total).
