[THOUGHT]
Given nums = [77, 9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43], m = max(nums) = 77.
The loop iterates 77 times, with i taking values from 0 to 76.
Thus, the state of i is the list of integers from 0 to 76.
The expression range(m) evaluates to range(0,77), which remains constant. Its value as a list is [0,1,...,76]. So the state of range(m) is that list repeated 77 times.
