[THOUGHT]
We are given nums = [1,2,3] and target=4.
The outer loop iterates over nums: n1 takes values 1,2,3 in order. So n1 state is [1,2,3]. The variable nums remains [1,2,3] throughout the outer loop, and since there are 3 outer iterations, we repeat its value 3 times: [[1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3]].

The inner loop is inside the outer loop and iterates over nums for each n1. So for each outer iteration, n2 takes values 1,2,3. Across all outer iterations, n2 takes values: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3. So n2 state is [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]. The variable nums remains [1,2,3] throughout all inner loop iterations (9 iterations), so we repeat it 9 times: [[1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3]].

1 def f(nums, target):
2     count = 0
3     for n1 in nums:## [STATE]n1=[1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
4         for n2 in nums:## [STATE]n2=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
5             count += (n1+n2==target)
6     return count
