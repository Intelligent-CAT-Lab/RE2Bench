[THOUGHT]
Given n=3, the list comprehension iterates over i in range(3). range(3) yields values 0, 1, 2. So i takes values [0, 1, 2] in order. The expression range(n) is constant and evaluates to range(0,3). Represented as a list, it is [0, 1, 2]. Since it stays the same for each of the 3 iterations, its state is that list repeated 3 times.

3     return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2][/STATE] [STATE]range(n)=[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]][/STATE]
