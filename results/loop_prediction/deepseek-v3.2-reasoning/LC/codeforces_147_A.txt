[THOUGHT]
Given input "x.x". Initially, `s = "x.x"` and `t = ',.?!'` (a string of four punctuation characters). The first loop iterates over each character in `t` in order: `i = ','`, `i = '.'`, `i = '?'`, `i = '!'`. For each iteration, `i` takes the corresponding character, while `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the state of `i` is the list of these characters. The state of `t` is the same value repeated for each iteration; following the example, we represent `t` as a list of its characters, repeated once per iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 s = input ( )
2 t = ',.?!'
3 for i in t : s = s . replace ( i , i + ' ' )## [STATE]i=[",", ".", "?", "!"][/STATE] [STATE]t=[[",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"], [",", ".", "?", "!"]][/STATE]
4 s =  ' ' . join ( s . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
5 for i in t : s = s . replace ( ' ' + i , i )
6 print (s)
