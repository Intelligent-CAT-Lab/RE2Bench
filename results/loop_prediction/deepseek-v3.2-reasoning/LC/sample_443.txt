[THOUGHT]
The input text is "lorem ipsum". The loop iterates over each character of the original string. In each iteration:
- space takes the next character: first 'l', then 'o', 'r', 'e', 'm', ' ', 'i', 'p', 's', 'u', 'm'.
- At each iteration, we check if space is a space. If it is, we call text.lstrip(), but since there is no leading whitespace, text remains unchanged. If space is not a space, we call text.replace('cd', space). Since 'cd' does not appear in text, text remains unchanged. Therefore, text stays as "lorem ipsum" throughout all 11 iterations.
Thus, the state of space is the list of characters in order, and the state of text is a list of 11 copies of the original string.

1 def f(text):
2     for space in text:## [STATE]space=["l", "o", "r", "e", "m", " ", "i", "p", "s", "u", "m"][/STATE] [STATE]text=["lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum", "lorem ipsum"][/STATE]
3         if space == ' ':
4             text = text.lstrip()
5         else:
6             text = text.replace('cd', space)
7     return text
