Given input text = "taole", length = 5.
total = (len(text)-1)*2 = (5-1)*2 = 4*2 = 8.
Thus, the for loop runs for i in range(1, 9) i.e., i values: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
The variable i changes each iteration, so its state across iterations is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].
The expression range(1, total+1) is constant and evaluates to range(1,9). For each iteration, its value is the same. So its state across iterations is repeated for the 8 iterations. We represent range(1,9) as a list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. So the state for range(1, total+1) is a list of 8 copies of that list.

1 def f(text):
2     ls = list(text)
3     total = (len(text) - 1) * 2
4     for i in range(1, total+1):## [STATE]i=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8][/STATE] [STATE]range(1, total+1)=[[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]][/STATE]
5         if i % 2:
6             ls.append('+')
7         else:
8             ls.insert(0, '+')
9     return ''.join(ls).rjust(total)
