[THOUGHT]
Input is " 1 1". Line 1: input().split() yields ["1", "1"], so x = ["1", "1"].
Line 2: len(x) = 2, so range(len(x)) is range(2). The loop iterates twice: i = 0, then i = 1.
Variable i takes values [0, 1].
The expression range(len(x)) evaluates to range(2), which as a list is [0, 1]. Since it remains constant through the two iterations, its state is two copies of that list.

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[[0, 1], [0, 1]][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
