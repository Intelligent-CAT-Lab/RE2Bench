[THOUGHT]
The input to the function is text = "jao mt" (length 6) and value = "house". The while loop runs as long as length > 0. Initially, length = 6. In each iteration, length decreases by 1. The loop runs 6 times, with length taking the values 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 at the start of each iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, value):
2     length = len(text)
3     index = 0
4     while length > 0:## [STATE]length=[6,5,4,3,2,1][/STATE]
5         value = text[index] + value
6         length -= 1
7         index += 1
8     return value
