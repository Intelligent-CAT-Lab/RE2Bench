[THOUGHT]
The input text is "x--y-z-5-C". After removing hyphens and converting to lowercase, we get "xyz5c". The for loop iterates over each character in order: 'x', 'y', 'z', '5', 'c'. So the state of `char` is ["x","y","z","5","c"]. The expression `text.replace('-', '').lower()` evaluates to "xyz5c", which as a list is ["x","y","z","5","c"]. It remains constant across all 5 iterations, so its state is repeated 5 times.

After the loop, the dictionary `d` counts each character, resulting in {'x':1, 'y':1, 'z':1, '5':1, 'c':1}. Sorting `d.items()` by value (all values are 1) gives the list [('x',1), ('y',1), ('z',1), ('5',1), ('c',1)] in stable order.

The list comprehension iterates over this list. In each iteration, `i` takes the first element of the tuple (the character), and `val` takes the second element (the count). So `i` state is ["x","y","z","5","c"], and `val` state is [1,1,1,1,1]. The iterable `d` is constant, so its state (represented as a list of lists) is repeated 5 times.
