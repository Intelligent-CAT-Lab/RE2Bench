[THOUGHT]
The input text is "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324", which has 29 characters. Therefore, len(text) = 29, and range(len(text)) = range(29). The for loop iterates 29 times, with i taking values from 0 to 28 in order. So the state of i is the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The range(len(text)) is constant and does not change during the loop; its value is the range object that generates numbers from 0 to 28. For the state, since it stays the same for each of the 29 iterations, its state is the list of numbers from 0 to 28 repeated 29 times.
