[THOUGHT]
Input numbers = [11,3]. The loop iterates over enumerate(numbers), which yields (index, value) pairs. Since the loop uses `i, _`, `i` takes the index, and the value is ignored.

First iteration: i = 0, enumerate(numbers) yields (0,11). The loop body appends numbers[1] (which is 3) to new_numbers.

Second iteration: i = 1, enumerate(numbers) yields (1,3). The loop body appends numbers[0] (which is 11) to new_numbers.

Thus, `i` takes values [0,1] over the iterations. `enumerate(numbers)` is an iterator that remains constant throughout the loop; when represented as a list, it is [(0,11), (1,3)]. Since its value does not change, it is repeated for each iteration.

3     for i, _ in enumerate(numbers):## [STATE]i=[0,1][/STATE] [STATE]enumerate(numbers)=[[(0, 11), (1, 3)], [(0, 11), (1, 3)]][/STATE]
4         new_numbers.append(numbers[len(numbers)-1-i])
5     return new_numbers
