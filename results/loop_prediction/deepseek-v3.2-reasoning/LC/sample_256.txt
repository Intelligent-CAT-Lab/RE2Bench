[THOUGHT]
The input text is "dorfunctions" with length 12, so b = 11. sub is "2", which is not in text, so text.rfind(sub) always returns -1.

The while loop runs as long as a <= b.

Start: a=0, b=11, condition true.

Iteration 1: c = (0+11)//2 = 5. Since -1 >= 5 is false, b = 5-1 = 4. Now a=0, b=4.

Iteration 2: a <= b, 0 <=4 true. c = (0+4)//2 = 2. -1 >=2 false, so b = 2-1 =1. Now a=0, b=1.

Iteration 3: a <= b, 0 <=1 true. c = (0+1)//2 = 0. -1 >=0 false, so b = 0-1 = -1. Now a=0, b=-1.

Condition check: 0 <= -1 false, loop ends.

So, the loop runs for 3 iterations. At the start of each iteration, a is always 0, and b takes values 11, 4, and 1.

1 def f(text, sub):
2     a = 0
3     b = len(text) - 1
4 
5     while a <= b:## [STATE]a=[0, 0, 0][/STATE] [STATE]b=[11, 4, 1][/STATE]
6         c = (a + b) // 2
7         if text.rfind(sub) >= c:
8             a = c + 1
9         else:
10             b = c - 1
11 
12     return a
