[THOUGHT]
The input s is "crew". len(s) = 4. The range is range(4-1, 0-1, -1) = range(3, -1, -1). This yields the sequence 3, 2, 1, 0. The loop iterates 4 times, with i taking each of these values in order. Therefore, the state of i is [3,2,1,0]. The range expression is evaluated once and produces the same range object throughout. Following the example, we represent the range as the list of its values [3,2,1,0] and repeat that list for each iteration, resulting in a list of 4 identical lists: [[3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0]].

1 def f(s):
2     r = []
3     for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1):## [STATE]i=[3,2,1,0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1)=[[3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0], [3,2,1,0]][/STATE]
4         r += s[i]
5     return ''.join(r)
