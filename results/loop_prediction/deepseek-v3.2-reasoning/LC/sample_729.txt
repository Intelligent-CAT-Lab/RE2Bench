[THOUGHT]
Given s1 = "abcdefghabc" and s2 = "abc", the initial value of i is s1.rfind(s2), which returns the highest index where s2 is found. s2 appears at index 0 and index 8, so i = 8.

First iteration: i = 8 at the start of the loop. The condition i != -1 is true. The loop body executes: res.append(i+len(s2)-1) = 8+3-1 = 10. Then i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i) searches for s2 in s1[0:8] (indices 0 to 7), finding it at index 0, so i becomes 0.

Second iteration: i = 0 at the start of the loop. The condition i != -1 is true. The loop body executes: res.append(0+3-1) = 2. Then i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i) searches in s1[0:0] (empty), returning -1, so i becomes -1.

The condition is checked again with i = -1, which is false, so the loop ends. Thus, the loop runs for two iterations, with i being 8 and 0 at the start of each iteration.

1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
