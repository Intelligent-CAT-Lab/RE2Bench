[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with text = "5f83u23saa". The list comprehension iterates over each character c in text. There are 10 characters. The variable c takes each character in order: '5', 'f', '8', '3', 'u', '2', '3', 's', 'a', 'a'. The variable text remains constant throughout the iterations, so its value "5f83u23saa" is repeated 10 times.

1 def f(text):
2     new_text = [c if c.isdigit() else '*' for c in text]## [STATE]c=["5", "f", "8", "3", "u", "2", "3", "s", "a", "a"][/STATE] [STATE]text=["5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa", "5f83u23saa"][/STATE]
3     return ''.join(new_text)
