[THOUGHT]
text = "was,". len(text) = 4.
range(len(text)-1, -1, -1) = range(3, -1, -1), which yields the sequence 3, 2, 1, 0.
The loop iterates 4 times. In each iteration, i takes the values:
iteration 1: i = 3
iteration 2: i = 2
iteration 3: i = 1
iteration 4: i = 0
Thus, i state: [3, 2, 1, 0].
The range expression is evaluated once before the loop and remains constant throughout. Its value (as a list) is [3, 2, 1, 0]. Since there are 4 iterations, we repeat this list 4 times as its state.

1 def f(text):
2     result = ''
3     for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[3, 2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)=[[3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
4         result += text[i]
5     return result
