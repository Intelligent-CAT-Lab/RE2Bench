[THOUGHT]
The input text is ",wPzPppdl/". Its length is 10. The loop runs for `i` in `range(len(text))`, which evaluates to `range(10)`. So `i` takes the values from 0 to 9 sequentially. Therefore, the state of `i` is the list `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`. The expression `range(len(text))` is evaluated once and remains constant throughout the loop. According to the instructions, we represent its value as a list (the numbers it produces) and repeat it for each iteration. Since the loop iterates 10 times, we repeat the list `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]` 10 times.
