[THOUGHT]
The input string is "    jcmfxv     ". Initially, l = list(string) gives a list of 15 characters: indices 0-3 spaces, 4-9: 'j','c','m','f','x','v', indices 10-14 spaces.
len(l) = 15, so reversed(range(15)) yields the sequence: [14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0].
The loop iterates over i in that sequence, but breaks when a non-space is encountered.
Iterations:
1. i=14, l[14] is space, pop index 14.
2. i=13, l[13] is space, pop index 13.
3. i=12, l[12] is space, pop index 12.
4. i=11, l[11] is space, pop index 11.
5. i=10, l[10] is space, pop index 10.
6. i=9, l[9] is 'v' (non-space), break.
So the loop runs 6 times. i takes values: 14,13,12,11,10,9.
The expression reversed(range(len(l))) is evaluated once at the start and does not change. Its value is the list [14,13,...,0]. So for each iteration, it remains that list.
Thus, we replace i state with [14,13,12,11,10,9] and reversed(range(len(l))) state with 6 copies of that list.
