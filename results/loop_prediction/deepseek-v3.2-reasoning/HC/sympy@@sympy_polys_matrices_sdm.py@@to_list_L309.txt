[THOUGHT]
Given the input, M is an SDM instance with data: row index 0 contains a dictionary mapping column 0 to e0 and column 1 to e1. Thus, M has shape (m,n) with at least m=1, n=2. The method to_list constructs a dense list representation.

Outer loop: for i, row in M.items(): Since M is a dict with one key (0), the loop iterates once.
- i = 0
- row = {0: e0, 1: e1}
- M.items() returns a dict_items object that yields (0, row). Its value is constant during the loop.

Inner loop: for j, e in row.items(): Since row has two keys (0 and 1), the loop iterates twice.
- First iteration: j = 0, e = e0
- Second iteration: j = 1, e = e1
- row.items() returns a dict_items object that yields (0, e0) and (1, e1). Its value is constant during the inner loop.

Following the example, we represent states as lists. For variables that change each iteration, we list their values in order. For variables that stay the same, we repeat their value for each iteration. We represent iterables like M.items() and row.items() as lists of their items.

Thus:
- i: [0]
- row: [{0: e0, 1: e1}]
- M.items(): we represent it as the list of tuples it yields: [(0, {0: e0, 1: e1})]. Since there is one outer iteration, we repeat it once: [ [(0, {0: e0, 1: e1})] ]
- j: [0, 1]
- e: [e0, e1]
- row.items(): we represent it as the list of tuples it yields: [(0, e0), (1, e1)]. Since there are two inner iterations, we repeat it twice: [ [(0, e0), (1, e1)], [(0, e0), (1, e1)] ]

Where e0 = "<sympy.external.pythonmpq.PythonMPQ at 0x75e10e2a2560>"
      e1 = "<sympy.external.pythonmpq.PythonMPQ at 0x75e10e2a17e0>"
