Input:`text = "2^x"` ⇒ `n = len(text) = 3`.

- Iterable in the loop (line 15): `itertools.chain(text, "\0")` yields all chars of `text` plus a sentinel `"\x00"` at the end:
  - Yields: `["2", "^", "x", "\x00"]`

- Enumerate behavior: `enumerate(...)` pairs each yielded char with a 0-based index:

- Therefore at the loop header:
