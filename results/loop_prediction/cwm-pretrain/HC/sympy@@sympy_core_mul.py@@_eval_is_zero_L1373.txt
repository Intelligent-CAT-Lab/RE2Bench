<think>
The method is `_eval_is_zero` and it calls `self._eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()`. The method `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` loops over `self.args`, so we need to determine the value of `self.args` and predict its elements. 

Given the context, `"pi/2"` is likely a symbolic representation of an expression involving π (pi) and 2, so `self` probably represents an expression like π/2. The `args` for such an expression would typically contain the individual parts (e.g., π and 2). 

Therefore, `self.args` is expected to contain the components of the expression. Since `self` represents "pi/2", we can assume that `self.args` includes the parts π and 2.

The loop iterates over `self.args`, so the variable `a` will take the values from `self.args`. Based on the input `"pi/2"`, we can expect that `self.args` contains π and 2, so `a` will take these values in each iteration.

Thus, we can predict the following:
- `a` will take values from `self.args` (likely [π, 2])
- `self.args` will be iterated over as [π, 2]
