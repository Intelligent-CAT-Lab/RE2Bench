2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" beween [STATE] and [/STATE] with your prediction of the state of variables associated with LOOPS.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list.
* You need to predict the states of variables in For loops, While loops, or List Comprehensions.
* If the value of a varibale stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state.
