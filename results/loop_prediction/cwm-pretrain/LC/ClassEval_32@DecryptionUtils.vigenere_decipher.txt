The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the trial court's factual determination of the \"landing use\" in the statute's exception was entitled to deference and was not clearly erroneous. It also noted that the circuit court failed to state why the findings were clearly erroneous. As for the school parking garage exception, the state's action of requiring the owner to prohibit criminal activity from occurring there is rationally related to the legislative purpose of keeping drugs and related activity away from children, and does not infringe on Loomis' rights."

        "model_answer": "Based on the given arguments, the defendant cannot successfully challenge the sentence. The case involves a \"land use\" exception for schools and school property in a Wisconsin statute prohibiting drug possession within 1000 feet of a school. The key issues addressed in the case are:\n\n1. The \"land use\" exception's requirements were sufficiently clear and satisfied the court's deferential standard of review, which requires the finding to be \"clearly erroneous.\" The appellate court erred by not affirming the trial court's finding.\n\n2. The school parking garage qualifies as school property under the exception. The defendant argued that the garage was owned by a church corporation and leased to the school, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the school's control and use of the property satisfied the exception.\n\n3. The state's law, which prohibits drug possession within 1000 feet of school property, is a valid exercise of state power for the purpose of protecting children from drug activity. The court found the law was rationally related to this legitimate government interest and did not infringe on defendant's rights."

        "model_answer": "The question of whether the defendant can challenge the sentence due to the violation of their rights is more complex and depends on the specific rights that were violated and the legal framework surrounding those rights. In the context of the case involving the parking garage and the school, the court would need to determine whether the collection and use of drug evidence found at the school, which is located in the parking garage, violated any of the defendant's constitutional rights, such as the right to privacy or the right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nTo challenge the sentence, the defendant would need to demonstrate that the evidence was obtained illegally or that its use in the sentencing process was unlawful. This would require a thorough examination of the search and seizure procedures used by the state officials, as well as the relevant legal precedents and constitutional protections.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific rights and protections afforded to individuals can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. Therefore, the defendant's ability to successfully challenge the sentence would depend on a nuanced analysis of the legal issues involved and the factual circumstances surrounding the evidence collection and sentencing process.\n\nIn conclusion, the defendant's ability to challenge the sentence because the evidence violated their rights would depend on a detailed examination of the legal framework and the specific rights that were potentially violated. It's recommended to consult with a qualified legal professional to thoroughly assess the situation and determine the best course of action."

The specific circumstances and the nature of the alleged violation of rights would be crucial in determining whether the challenge is valid.\n\nEvidence Analysis:\n1.

        "model_answer": "No, the defendant cannot challenge the sentence based on the argument that the evidence violated their rights. In the case of Loomis v. Wisconsin, the defendant was charged with possessing more than 30 grams of marijuana within 1000 feet of a school. The court held that the parking garage, where the drugs were found, was \"school property\" under a state statute due to its close relationship and use by the school, even though the parking garage was owned by a church corporation and only the upper levels were used by the school. The court reasoned that the parking garage was within the purview of the \"land use\" exception for schools in the state's statute because the trial court's finding of fact was entitled to deference, and the appellate court erred by not affirming the trial court's finding as not \"clearly erroneous\". As the court noted, the state's action of requiring the owner of the parking garage to prohibit criminal activity from occurring there is rationally related to the legislative purpose of keeping drugs and related activity away from children. Thus, the state's statute and its application to the parking garage were upheld, and the defendant's sentence was affirmed."
