Complete the loop annotations in the code with variable states.

<think>
`s` is initially the string "x.x".
`t` is a constant string ",.?!".

In the first for loop:
- Iteration 1: `i` = ',', `s` becomes "x.x" (no change)
- Iteration 2: `i` = '.', `s` becomes "x . x"
- Iteration 3: `i` = '?', `s` remains "x . x"
- Iteration 4: `i` = '!', `s` remains "x . x"

After the first loop, `s` is "x . x".
The second for loop adds a space after punctuation marks:
- Iteration 1: `i` = ',', no change to `s`
- Iteration 2: `i` = '.', no change to `s` (already "x . x")
- Iteration 3: `i` = '?', no change to `s`
- Iteration 4: `i` = '!', no change to `s`

The final print statement prints "x . x".

`T` is 4, which means the outer loop will iterate for i from 0 to 3 (inclusive).
For i=0, the inner loop will iterate once for j=0.
For i=1, the inner loop will iterate for j=0 and j=1.
For i=2, the inner loop will iterate for j=0, j=1, and j=2.
For i=3, the inner loop will iterate for j=0, j=1, j=2, and j=3.
This will result in a right-aligned triangle pattern of asterisks.

`f` is 2, `s` is 3.
In the outer loop, i will take values from 1 to f-1 (since range is exclusive).
So i will only be 1.
In the inner loop, j will take values from 1 to s-1 (since range is exclusive).
So j will be 1 and 2.
This means the sum will be incremented twice.
The final value of sum will be 2.

`s` is initially a list of the characters in "student".
`t` is 0.
In the while loop:
- Iteration 1: `t` = 0, `s[t]` is 's', which is not a vowel, so `t` increments to 1.
- Iteration 2: `t` = 1, `s[t]` is 't', which is not a vowel, so `t` increments to 2.
- Iteration 3: `t` = 2, `s[t]` is 'u', which is a vowel, so 'u' is deleted from `s`, `s` becomes ['s', 't', 'd', 'e', 'n', 't'], and `t` remains 2.
- Iteration 4: `t` = 2, `s[t]` is 'd', which is not a vowel, so `t` increments to 3.
- Iteration 5: `t` = 3, `s[t]` is 'e', which is a vowel, so 'e' is deleted from `s`, `s` becomes ['s', 't', 'd', 'n', 't'], and `t` remains 3.
- Iteration 6: `t` = 3, `s[t]` is 'n', which is not a vowel, so `t` increments to 4.
- Iteration 7: `t` = 4, `s[t]` is 't', which is not a vowel, so `t` increments to 5.
- Iteration 8: `t` = 5, which is not less than the length of `s` (5), so the loop ends.
The final value of `s` is ['s', 't', 'd', 'n', 't'].
