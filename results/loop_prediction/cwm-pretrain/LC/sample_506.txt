n is 1, which is odd, so we add 'sn' to p. Then we iterate from 1 to 1 (inclusive), so x takes the value 1. Since 1 is odd, we add 'ts' to p, making p 'snts'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1:
4         p+='sn'
5     else:
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):## [STATE]x=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range(1, n+1)=[[1], [1]][/STATE]
8         if x%2 == 0:
9             p+='to'
10         else:
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
