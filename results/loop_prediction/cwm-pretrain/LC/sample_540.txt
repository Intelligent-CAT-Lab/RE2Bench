The variable `a` is initialized to `[5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`, and a shallow copy of `a`, named `b`, is created at line 2. The code iterates through `a` using the `range` function with a step size of 2, meaning it will go through the values `0`, `2`, and `4`.

In each iteration, the value at the current index `k` in `b` is inserted at index `k + 1`. After each iteration, the value of `b` changes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. First iteration (`k = 0`):
   - Insert `b[0]` (which is `5`) at index `1` in `b`.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.

2. Second iteration (`k = 2`):
   - Insert `b[2]` (which is `5`) at index `3` in `b`.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.

3. Third iteration (`k = 4`):
   - Insert `b[4]` (which is `5`) at index `5` in `b`.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.

Finally, the code appends the first element of `b` (which is `5`) to the end of `b`, making `b` equal to `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`.
