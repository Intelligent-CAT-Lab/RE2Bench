Variable `x` starts at 80. In the first while loop, `x` decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0, and `h` and `s` increase by 1 each iteration. This means:
- x = [79, 78, 77, ..., 0] (80 iterations)
- h = [1, 2, 3, ..., 80]
- s = [1, 2, 3, ..., 80]

After the first loop completes, the second while loop runs as long as `s // b != 0`. Given `b = 970`, none of the `s` values (1 through 80) will be divisible by 970, so this loop will not execute.

The output is simply the value of `h` at this point, which is 80.
