<think>
`a` starts at 0 and `b` starts at len("dorfunctions") - 1 = 11. 
Each iteration calculates `c` as the floor division of (a + b) // 2. 
The condition text.rfind(sub) >= c determines whether to update `a` or `b`.
Since "dorfunctions".rfind("2") = -1 (not found), the condition text.rfind(sub) >= c is always false.
This means `a` stays the same (0) and `b` gets decremented each iteration.
The loop will terminate when `a` > `b`. This happens when `b` becomes -1 (since `a` stays at 0).
The final `a` value is 0, which is returned by the function.
