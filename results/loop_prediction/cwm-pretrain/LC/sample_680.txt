<think>
The input text is "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324". The loop iterates over each index from 0 to the length of the text.
For each index `i`, the loop checks if the character at that index is alphanumeric.
If the character is alphanumeric, it is added to the `letters` string.
The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to 30, and `range(len(text))` stays the same for every iteration.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     letters = ''
3     for i in range(len(text)):## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, ..., 30][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text))=[range(31), range(31), ..., range(31)][/STATE]
4         if text[i].isalnum():
5             letters += text[i]
6     return letters
