<think>
The method f takes a string "text" and removes the characters '+' from it.

Initially, new_text is converted to a list of characters from the input string "hbtofdeiequ".

The for loop iterates over the string '+' which contains just a single character '+'. 

In each iteration, the code checks if '+' is in new_text and removes it if present.

Since the input text doesn't contain '+', the character will not be removed.

After processing, new_text is joined back into a string.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     for i in '+':## [STATE]i=["+"][/STATE]
4         if i in new_text:
5             new_text.remove(i)
6     return ''.join(new_text)
