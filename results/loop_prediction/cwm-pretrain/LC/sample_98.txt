The input string is "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!". When split by spaces, we get:
["SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", "uknowN!"]
For each word, we check if it's title case:
"SOME" → True
"OF" → True
"THIS" → True
"Is" → True
"uknowN!" → False
The sum of these boolean values gives us the count of title-cased words.
