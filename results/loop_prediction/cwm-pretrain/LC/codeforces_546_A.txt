<think>
`k`, `n`, and `w` are integers assigned from the input "1 1 1".
The loop iterates over a range starting from 1 to `w + 1`, so the iteration range is [1, 2, 3] for `w = 1`.
For each iteration:
- First iteration (`i = 1`): `sum += k * i` => `sum += 1 * 1` => `sum = 1`
- Second iteration (`i = 2`): `sum += k * i` => `sum += 1 * 2` => `sum = 3`
- Third iteration (`i = 3`): `sum += k * i` => `sum += 1 * 3` => `sum = 6`
`sum` becomes 6 after all iterations.
The loop concludes, and the total sum is compared with `n`.
Since `sum` is 6 and `n` is 1, the condition `sum <= n` is false.
Therefore, the else block is executed, printing `sum - n`, which is `6 - 1 = 5`.
