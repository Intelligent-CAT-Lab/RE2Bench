`range(len(elements))` is a range of integers from 0 to 2 (inclusive) because the length of `elements` is 3.
`i` will take the values 0, 1, 2 in sequence.
`nums.pop()` removes the last element of `nums` and returns it. The loop will do this 3 times, so `nums` will have its last 3 elements removed.
The loop iterates 3 times:
Iteration 1: `i` = 0, `nums.pop()` = 2 (now nums = [7, 1])
Iteration 2: `i` = 1, `nums.pop()` = 1 (now nums = [7])
Iteration 3: `i` = 2, `nums.pop()` = 7 (now nums = [])
`range(len(elements))` is the same for each iteration, so its value is repeated for all iterations.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, elements):
2     result = []
3     for i in range(len(elements)): ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(elements))=[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]][/STATE]
4         result.append(nums.pop())
5     return nums
