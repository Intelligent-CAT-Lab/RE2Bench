You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [STATE]{VARIABLE_NAME}=??[/STATE].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" beween [STATE] and [/STATE] with your prediction of the state of variables associated with LOOPS.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list.
* You need to predict the states of variables in For loops, While loops, or List Comprehensions.
* If the value of a varibale stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state.
* Determine variable states by tracing the code step by step. Wrap your reasoning in <think> ... </think>
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:
