[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input `nums` is `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.

The loop `for n in nums:` iterates over each element in `nums`:
- Iteration 1: `n = 1`
- Iteration 2: `n = 1`
- Iteration 3: `n = 3`
- Iteration 4: `n = 1`
- Iteration 5: `n = 3`
- Iteration 6: `n = 1`

So `n` takes the values: `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`

`nums` stays the same throughout all iterations: `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`

Since there are 6 iterations and `nums` doesn't change, it should be repeated 6 times in the state.

1 def f(nums):
2     output = []
3     for n in nums:## [STATE]n=[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1][/STATE] [STATE]nums=[[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]][/STATE]
4         output.append((nums.count(n), n))
5     output.sort(reverse=True)
6     return output
