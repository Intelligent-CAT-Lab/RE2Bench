[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is `sample = "present/here/car%2Fwe"`.

The while loop condition is `sample.find('/', i+1) != -1`. Let me trace through:

Initial state: `i = -1`

**Iteration 1:**
- Check condition: `sample.find('/', i+1)` = `sample.find('/', 0)` = 7 (the first '/' is at index 7)
- 7 != -1, so condition is True, enter loop
- `i = sample.find('/', 0)` = 7

**Iteration 2:**
- Check condition: `sample.find('/', i+1)` = `sample.find('/', 8)` = 12 (the second '/' is at index 12)
- 12 != -1, so condition is True, enter loop
- `i = sample.find('/', 8)` = 12

**Iteration 3:**
- Check condition: `sample.find('/', i+1)` = `sample.find('/', 13)` = -1 (no more '/' found after index 12)
- -1 != -1 is False, so exit loop

So the `sample.find('/', i+1)` values are: 7, 12, -1

The state of this expression throughout the loop iterations (checking the condition each time):
- Before iteration 1: 7
- Before iteration 2: 12
- Before iteration 3 (exit condition check): -1

So we need to record: [7, 12, -1]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(sample):
2     i = -1
3     while sample.find('/', i+1) != -1:## [STATE]["sample.find('/', i+1)"]=[7, 12, -1][/STATE]
4         i = sample.find('/', i+1)
5     return sample.rindex('/', 0, i)
6 f('present/here/car%2Fwe')
