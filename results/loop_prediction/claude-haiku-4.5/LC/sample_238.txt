[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The function `f` is called with:
- `ls = [[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
- `n = 1`

The loop `for i in ls:` iterates over each element in the list `ls`.

Iteration 1:
- `i = [1, 9, 4]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`

Iteration 2:
- `i = [83, 0, 5]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`

Iteration 3:
- `i = [9, 6, 100]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`

So `i` takes the values: `[1, 9, 4]`, `[83, 0, 5]`, `[9, 6, 100]` (3 iterations)
And `ls` stays the same throughout all 3 iterations.
