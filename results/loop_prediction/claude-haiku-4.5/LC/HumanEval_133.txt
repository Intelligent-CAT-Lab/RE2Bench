[THOUGHT]
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9].

The for loop iterates over each element in `lst`:
- Iteration 1: `i` = -1.4
- Iteration 2: `i` = 17.9
- Iteration 3: `i` = 18.9
- Iteration 4: `i` = 19.9

`lst` remains the same throughout all iterations: [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]

So:
- `i` takes values: [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]
- `lst` stays the same for all 4 iterations, so it's repeated 4 times: [[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]]
