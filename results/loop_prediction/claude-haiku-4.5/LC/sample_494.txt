[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Initial state:
- `num` = "1" (string of length 1)
- `l` = 3
- `t` = ""

The while loop condition is: `l > len(num)`, which means `l > 1` (since len("1") = 1)

Iteration 1:
- Condition: `3 > 1` → True, enter loop
- `t` += '0' → `t` = "0"
- `l` -= 1 → `l` = 2
- At end of iteration: `l` = 2, `num` = "1"

Iteration 2:
- Condition: `2 > 1` → True, enter loop
- `t` += '0' → `t` = "00"
- `l` -= 1 → `l` = 1
- At end of iteration: `l` = 1, `num` = "1"

Iteration 3:
- Condition: `1 > 1` → False, exit loop

So the loop executes 2 times.

For each iteration:
- `l` takes values: 3, 2
- `num` stays "1" throughout (it's never modified in the loop)

The STATE markers should show the values at the beginning of each iteration check.

`l` states: [3, 2] (the values of l when the condition is checked)
`num` states: ["1", "1"] (num stays the same for both iterations)

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
