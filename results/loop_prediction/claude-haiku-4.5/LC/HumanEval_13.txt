[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this Euclidean algorithm step by step.

Initial state: a = 10, b = 15

The while loop continues as long as b is truthy (non-zero).

Iteration 1:
- b = 15 (truthy, so we enter the loop)
- a, b = b, a % b → a, b = 15, 10 % 15 → a, b = 15, 10

Iteration 2:
- b = 10 (truthy, so we continue)
- a, b = b, a % b → a, b = 10, 15 % 10 → a, b = 10, 5

Iteration 3:
- b = 5 (truthy, so we continue)
- a, b = b, a % b → a, b = 5, 10 % 5 → a, b = 5, 0

Iteration 4:
- b = 0 (falsy, so we exit the loop)

So the state of b at each iteration check (at the while condition) is:
- Before iteration 1: 15
- Before iteration 2: 10
- Before iteration 3: 5
- Before iteration 4: 0 (loop exits)

The loop executes 3 times with b values of 15, 10, and 5 respectively.
