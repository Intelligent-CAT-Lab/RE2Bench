[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Initial values:
- x = 4
- base = 5
- ret = ""

The while loop continues while x > 0.

**Iteration 1:**
- x = 4 (check: 4 > 0? Yes, enter loop)
- ret = str(4 % 5) + "" = str(4) + "" = "4"
- x = 4 // 5 = 0
- At end of iteration 1: x = 0

**Check condition for iteration 2:**
- x = 0 (check: 0 > 0? No, exit loop)

So the loop executes exactly 1 time with x = 4 at the start of that iteration.

The state of x at the condition check should show the value(s) of x when the while condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration:
- Iteration 1: x = 4 (condition is True, enter loop)
- After iteration 1, x = 0 (condition is False, exit loop)

So the state should be [4] since x only takes the value 4 one time when the condition is checked and the loop body executes.

Wait, let me reconsider. The [STATE] marker appears at line 4, right after the while statement. This is asking for the state of x during the loop iterations. Since the loop only executes once with x = 4, the answer should be [4].
