[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The function `f` is called with:
- `nums` = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]
- `target` = 5

The for loop iterates over each element in `nums`:

Iteration 1: `i` = 12
Iteration 2: `i` = 516
Iteration 3: `i` = 5
Iteration 4: `i` = 2
Iteration 5: `i` = 3
Iteration 6: `i` = 214
Iteration 7: `i` = 51

So `i` takes values: [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]

`nums` remains the same throughout all iterations: [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]

Since `nums` doesn't change through 7 iterations, I need to repeat it 7 times.
