[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Initial state:
- `nums` = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]
- `count` = len(nums) = 5
- The for loop is: `for num in range(2, count)`, which means `for num in range(2, 5)`

`range(2, 5)` generates the sequence: 2, 3, 4

So the loop will iterate 3 times:
- Iteration 1: `num` = 2, `range(2, count)` = range(2, 5)
- Iteration 2: `num` = 3, `range(2, count)` = range(2, 5)
- Iteration 3: `num` = 4, `range(2, count)` = range(2, 5)

The `range(2, count)` object stays the same throughout all iterations since `count` is never modified in the loop.

So:
- `num` takes values: [2, 3, 4]
- `range(2, count)` stays the same for all 3 iterations: [range(2, 5), range(2, 5), range(2, 5)]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums):
2     count = len(nums)
3     for num in range(2, count):## [STATE]num=[2, 3, 4][/STATE] [STATE]range(2, count)=[range(2, 5), range(2, 5), range(2, 5)][/STATE]
4         nums.sort()
5     return nums
