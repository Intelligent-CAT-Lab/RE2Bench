[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Initial values:
- s1 = "abcdefghabc"
- s2 = "abc"
- res = []

Line 3: `i = s1.rfind(s2)`
- s1.rfind("abc") finds the rightmost occurrence of "abc" in "abcdefghabc"
- "abc" appears at index 0 and index 8 (positions: s1[8:11] = "abc")
- rfind returns the rightmost match, so i = 8

First iteration of while loop (i = 8):
- Condition: i != -1 is True (8 != -1)
- Line 5: res.append(8 + 3 - 1) = res.append(10), so res = [10]
- Line 6: i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i) = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 8)
  - This searches for "abc" in s1[0:8] = "abcdefgh"
  - "abc" is found at index 0
  - So i = 0

Second iteration of while loop (i = 0):
- Condition: i != -1 is True (0 != -1)
- Line 5: res.append(0 + 3 - 1) = res.append(2), so res = [10, 2]
- Line 6: i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i) = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 0)
  - This searches for "abc" in s1[0:0] = "" (empty string)
  - "abc" is not found, so i = -1

Third iteration check:
- Condition: i != -1 is False (-1 == -1)
- Loop exits

So the while loop executes twice, and i takes the values: [8, 0]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
