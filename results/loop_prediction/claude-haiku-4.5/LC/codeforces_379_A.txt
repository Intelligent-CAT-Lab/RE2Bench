Let me trace through this code step by step with input "80 970".

First, parsing input:
- a = 80
- b = 970
- x = a = 80
- h = 0
- s = 0

Now the first while loop (line 5): `while x > 0:`
This loop runs while x > 0. Each iteration:
- x -= 1 (decrements x)
- h += 1 (increments h)
- s += 1 (increments s)

The loop runs from x = 80 down to x = 0 (80 iterations total).
Let me trace the values of x through each iteration:
- Iteration 1: x = 80 (check x > 0: True) → x becomes 79
- Iteration 2: x = 79 → x becomes 78
- Iteration 3: x = 78 → x becomes 77
- ...continuing...
- Iteration 80: x = 1 → x becomes 0

So x takes values: [80, 79, 78, 77, ..., 2, 1] (80 values)

After the loop completes:
- x = 0
- h = 80
- s = 80

Now the second while loop (line 9): `while s // b != 0:`
We need to check s // b != 0, where s = 80 and b = 970.
s // b = 80 // 970 = 0
So the condition is False immediately, and this loop doesn't execute.

The question asks only about the first while loop at line 5.

For line 5, x starts at 80 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it becomes 0.
The states of x at each iteration are: [80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
