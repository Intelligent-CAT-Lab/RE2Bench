[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Initial state:
- `text = "egmdartoa"`
- `sub = "good"`
- `index = []`
- `starting = 0`

The while loop continues while `starting != -1`.

**Iteration 1:**
- Check: `starting = 0`, which is `!= -1`, so enter loop
- Line 5: `starting = text.find("good", 0)` → "good" is not found in "egmdartoa", so `starting = -1`
- Line 6: Check `if starting != -1` → `if -1 != -1` → False, so skip lines 7-8
- Back to line 4: Check `starting != -1` → `-1 != -1` → False, exit loop

So the loop executes only once.

The state of `starting` at the beginning of each iteration (line 4):
- Iteration 1: `starting = 0`

Then after line 5 in iteration 1, `starting = -1`, and the condition becomes false.

So at line 4, before checking the condition, the value of `starting` is:
- Iteration 1: `0`

Since the loop only runs once, `starting` has only one state value: `[0]`

1 def f(text, sub):
2     index = []
3     starting = 0
4     while starting != -1:## [STATE]starting=[0][/STATE]
5         starting = text.find(sub, starting)
6         if starting != -1:
7             index.append(starting)
8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
