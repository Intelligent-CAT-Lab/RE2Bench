[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is `text = "was,"`

First, let me understand what the range does:
- `len(text)` = 4
- `len(text) - 1` = 3
- `range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)` = `range(3, -1, -1)`

This creates a range that counts down from 3 to 0 (inclusive), so it generates: 3, 2, 1, 0

Now let me trace the loop iterations:

Iteration 1: `i = 3`
- `text[3]` = ',' (the 4th character, 0-indexed)

Iteration 2: `i = 2`
- `text[2]` = 's' (the 3rd character)

Iteration 3: `i = 1`
- `text[1]` = 'a' (the 2nd character)

Iteration 4: `i = 0`
- `text[0]` = 'w' (the 1st character)

So `i` takes the values: 3, 2, 1, 0

The `range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)` stays the same throughout all iterations, so it should be repeated 4 times (once for each iteration).
`range(3, -1, -1)` is the same object each time.

1 def f(text):
2     result = ''
3     for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1):## [STATE]i=[3, 2, 1, 0][/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text)-1, -1, -1)=[range(3, -1, -1), range(3, -1, -1), range(3, -1, -1), range(3, -1, -1)][/STATE]
4         result += text[i]
5     return result
