[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Input: " 1 1"

Line 1: `x = list(input().split())`
- `input()` returns " 1 1"
- `.split()` splits by whitespace, returning ["1", "1"]
- `list()` converts it to a list: ["1", "1"]
- So `x = ["1", "1"]`

Line 2: `for i in range(len(x)):`
- `len(x)` = 2
- `range(2)` produces the sequence [0, 1]
- The loop will iterate twice with `i` taking values 0, then 1

Iteration 1: i = 0
- Line 3: `x[0] = int(x[0])` converts "1" to 1, so x becomes [1, "1"]

Iteration 2: i = 1
- Line 3: `x[1] = int(x[1])` converts "1" to 1, so x becomes [1, 1]

So:
- `i` takes values: 0, 1
- `range(len(x))` is the same sequence for both iterations: range(2), which when expanded is [0, 1]

For the state annotations:
- `i` should be: [0, 1]
- `range(len(x))` should be: [range(2), range(2)] or we can represent it as the values it generates: [0, 1], [0, 1] (repeated for each iteration)

Actually, looking at the example more carefully, the format for `range(len(x))` should show what `range(len(x))` evaluates to. Since `len(x)` = 2 throughout both iterations, `range(len(x))` = `range(2)` for both iterations. However, when we talk about the "state" of a range object in the context of a for loop, we typically express it as the sequence of values it generates.

Let me reconsider: `range(len(x))` returns a range object that generates [0, 1]. Since this doesn't change across iterations (len(x) is always 2), it stays the same.

The state should show:
- `i`: [0, 1] (the values i takes in each iteration)
- `range(len(x))`: [range(2), range(2)] or [0,1] repeated, but more precisely the range object which generates 0, 1

Looking at the example again, they use actual values. So:
- `range(len(x))` should be represented as what it is: range(2) for both iterations, or we could show the generated sequence [0, 1] for each iteration.

I'll represent it as: the state of the range object, which is range(2) for both iterations, meaning it stays the same.

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :## [STATE]i=[0, 1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( len ( x ) )=[range(2), range(2)][/STATE]
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else :
10     print ( 0 )
