[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is `n = 1`.

First, `str(n)` converts `1` to the string `"1"`.

The loop `for c in str(n):` iterates over each character in the string `"1"`.

Since `str(1) = "1"`, there is only one character to iterate over:
- Iteration 1: `c = "1"`

`str(n)` remains constant throughout the loop as `"1"`.

So:
- `c` takes the value `"1"` for 1 iteration
- `str(n)` is `"1"` for 1 iteration

1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=["1"][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
