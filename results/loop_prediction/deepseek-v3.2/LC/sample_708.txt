The input string is `"    jcmfxv     "`.  

Line 2: `l = list(string)` gives `l = [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'j', 'c', 'm', 'f', 'x', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']`  
Length of l is 15.

Line 3: `reversed(range(len(l)))`  
`range(len(l))` = `range(0, 15)` = `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]`  
`reversed(range(len(l)))` = `[14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]`  

Now loop:
Iteration 1: `i = 14`, `l[14]` is `' '` (space) → condition `l[i] != ' '` is false → pop index 14 → l length = 14.  
Iteration 2: `i = 13`, `l[13]` is now `' '` (original index 13) → pop index 13 → l length = 13.  
Iteration 3: `i = 12`, `l[12]` is now `' '` → pop index 12 → l length = 12.  
Iteration 4: `i = 11`, `l[11]` is now `' '` → pop index 11 → l length = 11.  
Iteration 5: `i = 10`, `l[10]` is now `' '` → pop index 10 → l length = 10.  

Now `l` = `[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'j', 'c', 'm', 'f', 'x', 'v']`  

Iteration 6: `i = 9`, `l[9]` is `'v'` → condition `l[i] != ' '` is true → break loop.  

So:  
`i` values seen before break: `[14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9]`  
`reversed(range(len(l)))` at start of loop: `[14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]`  
Since the loop breaks at i=9, `reversed(range(len(l)))` stays same for each iteration as we only use initial value in comment.  

Actually, the loop variable `i` goes through first 6 items of that list. The instruction says: "If the value of a variable stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state" — but `reversed(range(len(l)))` is an iterator expression evaluated once at the start; each iteration uses the same iterator object but the code refers to the expression before entering loop? In example, they repeated the whole list for `t` in each iteration, even though `t` doesn’t change in value (but here reversed(range(...)) is a list). Actually, in example, t is `"#284"` but they made t state = [["#","2","8","4"], ...] repeated 4 times. So here `reversed(range(len(l)))` is `[14,13,...,0]` initially and we repeat that list for each iteration (6 times).  

So:
- `i` state = `[14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9]`  
- `reversed(range(len(l)))` state = `[[14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0], [14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0], ...]` 6 times.  

But len(l) changes during loop — but reversed(range(len(l))) was computed at the start with len=15, so we should keep that fixed original list for all iterations.

So list = `[14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]` repeated 6 times.
