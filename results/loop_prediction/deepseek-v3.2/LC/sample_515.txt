[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the code step by step:

1. Line 2: `array` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, so `result = array.copy()` gives `result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. Line 3: `result.reverse()` makes `result = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
3. Line 4: List comprehension `[item * 2 for item in result]` processes each item in `result`:
   - First iteration: `item = 5`
   - Second iteration: `item = 4`
   - Third iteration: `item = 3`
   - Fourth iteration: `item = 2`
   - Fifth iteration: `item = 1`
   
   During each iteration, `result` has the original reversed list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` because the assignment `result[:] = ...` happens after the comprehension completes.

   So the states are:
   - `item`: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `result`: `[[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]`
