[THOUGHT]  
We are given:  
- `x = 4`, `base = 5`.  
- Loop condition: `while x > 0`.  
- We need to track `x` at the start of each iteration (or equivalently, before each execution of the loop body).  

Iteration 1:  
- Before loop: `x = 4`. Loop condition true.  
- Inside loop: `x % base = 4 % 5 = 4`, `x //= base` → `x = 4 // 5 = 0`.  

Iteration 2:  
- Start of next iteration? `x` is now 0, `0 > 0` is false, so loop ends.  

So `x` in state annotation should be the values of `x` at the beginning of each iteration (or the state as the loop header is encountered). That’s just `[4]`. Wait, but the example with `t` shows that if variable changes during loop, we list it as it is at the start of each iteration (and if it doesn’t change inside loop, repeat it for each iteration). Here `x` changes each iteration, so we should list it as it is when we check `while x > 0`.  

Let’s trace again:  
1. Before loop starts: `x = 4`. First time loop header executed: `x = 4`.  
Loop runs, `x` becomes 0. Loop header condition re-evaluated with `x = 0` → false → loop stops.  

Thus the loop runs once. So at header in the only iteration: `x = 4`.  

So `x=??` should be replaced by `[4]`.  

But wait: some conventions for state annotation might want the sequence of values of `x` just before each loop iteration (which is what I did). The given example shows for each iteration of the `for` loop they listed `c` as the sequence of values and `t` as the repeated sequence for each iteration.  

Actually in `while` loops, the loop condition may change `x` inside loop, but we trace `x` at the loop header (immediately before body executes).  

Thus `x` states = `[4]`.  

Check: In the example, for `t` in `for c in t`, they gave `t` as `[["#","2","8","4"], ... repeated]`. That’s because `t` is the same in each iteration. For `x` here, it's not the same each iteration, but here there’s only one iteration, so list length 1.  

So final answer: `[4]`.
