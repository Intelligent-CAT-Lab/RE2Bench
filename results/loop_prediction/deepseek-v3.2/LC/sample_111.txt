[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the code step by step.

Input marks is a dictionary: {"x": 67, "v": 89, "": 4, "alij": 11, "kgfsd": 72, "yafby": 83}

Line 4: `for value in marks.values()`  
`marks.values()` gives an iterable of the dictionary's values. In the order of insertion (since Python 3.7+ preserves insertion order for dict), the values are:
67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83

Now each iteration:

Iteration 1: value = 67  
Iteration 2: value = 89  
Iteration 3: value = 4  
Iteration 4: value = 11  
Iteration 5: value = 72  
Iteration 6: value = 83

The `marks.values()` does not change during iteration, so for each iteration, `marks.values()` is the same list/iterable.

But note: The instruction says: "If the value of a variable stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state."  
Here `marks.values()` is the same each iteration, so we repeat its value 6 times.

We need to represent `marks.values()` in each iteration. But careful: `marks.values()` returns a `dict_values` object, not a list. For annotation, we can write it as a list of values for clarity.

Thus:
- value state = [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]
- marks.values() state = [[67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83], [67, 89, 4, 11, 72, 83]]
