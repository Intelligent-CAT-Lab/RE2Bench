[THOUGHT]  
The input `text` is `"we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324"`.  
`len(text)` is the length of this string. Let's count:  

`we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324`  
Characters: w(1), e(2), @(3), 3(4), 2(5), r(6), 7(7), 1(8), g(9), 7(10), 2(11), u(12), g(13), 9(14), 4(15), =(16), ((17), 8(18), 2(19), 3(20), 6(21), 5(22), 8(23), *(24), !(25), @(26), 3(27), 2(28), 4(29)  
So `len(text) = 29`.  

`range(len(text))` is `range(0, 29)` → a sequence of integers from 0 to 28 inclusive.  

The loop iterates `i` from 0 to 28.  

So:  
`i` takes values: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]`.  
`range(len(text))` is the same iterable each iteration, so its state is a list of the same sequence repeated for each iteration: length 29 identical elements.  

Thus:  
`range(len(text))` = `[range(0, 29), range(0, 29), ..., range(0, 29)]` repeated 29 times. But the code annotation wants the actual sequence shown. Since it's fixed, we represent as a list of 29 identical lists of numbers 0..28.  

Better to show: `[[0, 1, 2, ..., 28], [0, 1, 2, ..., 28], ...]` repeated 29 times.
