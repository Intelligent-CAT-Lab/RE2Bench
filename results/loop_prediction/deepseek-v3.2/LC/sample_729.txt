[THOUGHT]  
Given:  
- s1 = "abcdefghabc"  
- s2 = "abc"  
The function finds occurrences of s2 in s1 from the right using `rfind`.  

Line 3: `i = s1.rfind(s2)` finds the rightmost occurrence of "abc" in "abcdefghabc".  
- "abc" appears twice: at indices 0 and 8 (0-indexed). Rightmost is at index 8.  
So i = 8 initially.  

Loop iterations:  
1. i = 8, i != -1 → true, enter loop.  
   Append i + len(s2) - 1 = 8 + 3 - 1 = 10 to res.  
   Next: i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i) = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 8) searches in s1[0:8] from the right.  
   In "abcdefghabc"[0:8] = "abcdefgh", "abc" appears at index 0.  
   So new i = 0.  

2. i = 0, i != -1 → true, enter loop.  
   Append 0 + 3 - 1 = 2 to res.  
   Next: i = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 0) searches in s1[0:0] = "" → returns -1.  
   So new i = -1.  

3. i = -1, i != -1 → false, exit loop.  

Variable `i` takes values: 8, 0, -1 across loop checks (including the final -1 which causes exit).  
We record states for each time the loop condition is evaluated, so at line 4: first evaluation i=8, second i=0, third i=-1 (but loop body doesn't run for i=-1).  
The `??` should show list of `i` for each iteration start: [8, 0, -1]? Wait, careful:  

Actually `[STATE]i=??[/STATE]` is at line 4, the while condition check. We need values of `i` each time line 4 executes. That happens:  
- Before loop body runs (1st time): i=8.  
- After loop body runs and jumps to line 4 again: i=0 (2nd check).  
- After loop body runs and jumps to line 4 again: i=-1 (3rd check, loop stops).  

So states: i = [8, 0, -1].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0, -1][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
