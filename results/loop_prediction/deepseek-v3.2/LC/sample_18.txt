We need to trace the execution step by step.

Initial state:
- `array` = [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
- `elem` = 3
- Line 2: `k = 0`
- Line 3: `l = array.copy()` → `l` = [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

Now we enter the loop: `for i in l:`
We need to track `i` and `l` at each iteration. Note that `l` is not modified inside the loop, so it stays the same throughout.

Iteration 1:
`i` = first element of `l` = 3
Check `if i > elem`: 3 > 3? False, so not true.
Then `k += 1` → `k` becomes 1.

Iteration 2:
`i` = second element of `l` = 5
Check `if i > elem`: 5 > 3? True.
Then `array.insert(k, elem)` → `k` is currently 1, so insert `elem` (3) at index 1 of `array`.
`array` becomes [3, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Then `break` → loop terminates.

Thus the loop runs for only 2 iterations. So:
- `i` values: [3, 5]
- `l` values: same each iteration: [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] repeated twice.

Since there are 2 iterations, `l` state should be the same list repeated 2 times.

Thus:
`i` = [3, 5]
`l` = [[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]]

1 def f(array, elem):
2     k = 0
3     l = array.copy()
4     for i in l:## [STATE]i=[3, 5][/STATE] [STATE]l=[[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]][/STATE]
5         if i > elem:
6             array.insert(k, elem)
7             break
8         k += 1
9     return array
