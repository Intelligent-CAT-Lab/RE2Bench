[THOUGHT]  
We start with `text = "Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#"`.  
Line 2: `text = list(text)` converts it to a list of characters.  
Length of `text` after list conversion = number of characters in the string.  
Let's write out the string to see characters and positions:  

`"Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#"`  
Index positions:  
0: 'H'  
1: 'e'  
2: 'y'  
3: ' '  
4: 'D'  
5: 'U'  
6: 'd'  
7: 'E'  
8: ' '  
9: 'T'  
10: 'H'  
11: 'i'  
12: 's'  
13: ' '  
14: '$'  
15: 'n'  
16: 'd'  
17: '^'  
18: ' '  
19: '&'  
20: '*'  
21: '&'  
22: 't'  
23: 'h'  
24: 'i'  
25: 's'  
26: '@'  
27: '#'  

Length = 28 characters (indices 0..27).  

Loop: `for i in range(len(text)):` → `range(28)` → i values: 0,1,2,...,27.  

At each iteration, we check `if i % 2 == 1:` (odd indices).  

`range(len(text))` is the same for all iterations: `range(28)`, but `range` object doesn't change. The problem asks for `range(len(text))` state for each iteration— it's the same value for each iteration. For variable states in loop annotations, if the variable value stays same through K iterations, we repeat it K times.  

So `range(len(text))` in each iteration = `range(28)` repeated for each i.  

List form of range(28): `[0, 1, 2, ..., 27]`.  

i for each iteration:  
Iteration 1: i=0  
Iteration 2: i=1  
…  
Iteration 28: i=27.  

So i list: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27].  

`range(len(text))` each time: range(28) repeated 28 times.  

Therefore:  

i = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]  
range(len(text)) = `[range(28), range(28), ... 28 times]`  
But must output as a list of lists? Actually format is: show the actual iterable that `range(...)` represents — so a list from 0 to 27. For each iteration, the state is that list.  

In the example, `t` was string "#284", and for each iteration they repeated `["#","2","8","4"]` as the value of `t` (state variable inside loop). So similarly, `range(len(text))` is constant for each iteration, so we repeat `[0,1,...,27]` 28 times.  

Wait: In example, `t` variable’s state for each iteration was a list of 4 chars repeated 4 times → so 4-element list each time (same list).  

So here: `range(len(text))` is an object that yields 0..27. Since it’s same for each iteration, for each iteration we put `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]`. Do 28 times.  

But: In annotation, we must put [STATE]i=??[/STATE] [STATE]range(len(text))=??[/STATE]  

We fill: i: list of i’s across iterations = the sequence 0..27 once as a list.  
range(len(text)): list of the same range(28) converted to list repeated 28 times: i.e., a list containing [0..27] repeated 28 times in outer list.  

So:  

i = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]  

range(len(text)) = [[0,1,2,...,27], [0,1,2,...,27], ..., (28 times)]  

Let’s write it in code annotation format.
