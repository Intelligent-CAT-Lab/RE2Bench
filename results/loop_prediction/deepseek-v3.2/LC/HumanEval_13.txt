[THOUGHT]  
We are given `a = 10`, `b = 15`. The loop is `while b:`, and inside the loop we update `a, b = b, a % b`.  

Step-by-step:  

**Iteration 1**:  
Initial `a = 10`, `b = 15`. `b` is truthy (15 ≠ 0) so loop runs.  
`a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 15`, `b = 10 % 15 = 10`.  

**Iteration 2**:  
Now `a = 15`, `b = 10`. `b` is truthy (10 ≠ 0).  
`a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 10`, `b = 15 % 10 = 5`.  

**Iteration 3**:  
Now `a = 10`, `b = 5`. `b` is truthy (5 ≠ 0).  
`a, b = b, a % b` → `a = 5`, `b = 10 % 5 = 0`.  

**Iteration 4**:  
Now `a = 5`, `b = 0`. Loop condition `while b:` fails (0 is falsy), so exit.  

We need the state of `b` for each **evaluation of the loop condition**.  
At loop start (before 1st iteration): `b = 15`.  
After first loop body, before second check: `b = 10`.  
After second loop body, before third check: `b = 5`.  
After third loop body, before fourth check: `b = 0` → loop ends, but this `b=0` is not part of execution of loop body (since condition fails before entering).  

So `b` at each entry to the loop body: `[15, 10, 5]`.
