[THOUGHT]
The input provides ls = [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]] and n=1.
The loop iterates over each element i in ls:
Iteration 1: i = [1,9,4]. Since i[0] == n (1 == 1), answer becomes [1,9,4].
Iteration 2: i = [83,0,5]. i[0] = 83 != 1, so no change.
Iteration 3: i = [9,6,100]. i[0] = 9 != 1, so no change.
Thus, the values of i through the loop are: [1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100].
The variable ls remains unchanged throughout, so its state is the same value repeated for each of the 3 iterations: the original list [[1,9,4], [83,0,5], [9,6,100]] repeated three times.
