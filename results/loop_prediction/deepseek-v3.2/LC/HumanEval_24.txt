[THOUGHT]  
The input is `n = 3`.  
`reversed(range(n))` will be `reversed(range(3))` which is `reversed(0, 1, 2)` → `[2, 1, 0]`.  
The loop runs with `i` taking each value in order until `n % i == 0` is true.  
Let’s trace:  

- Iteration 1: `i = 2`. `n % i == 0` → `3 % 2 == 1` → False.  
- Iteration 2: `i = 1`. `3 % 1 == 0` → True. So loop stops at this iteration.  

So `i` values across iterations: `[2, 1]`  
`reversed(range(n))` is the same list `[2, 1, 0]` each iteration, but since loop stops early, it is only evaluated fully for iteration 1 and iteration 2. However, since it’s created before the loop starts, its value is fixed. In each iteration, the loop variable `i` changes, but `reversed(range(n))` refers to the same object. We list it once per iteration.  

Thus:  
`i = [2, 1]`  
`reversed(range(n)) = [[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]]` (two iterations).
