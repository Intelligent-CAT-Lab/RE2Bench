[THOUGHT]
The input is n=1. So str(n) becomes "1". The loop "for c in str(n):" iterates over each character in the string "1". There is only one iteration: c = '1'. The variable str(n) remains "1" throughout the iteration. Following the example pattern, we represent c as a list of its values: ["1"]. For str(n), since it stays the same, we represent it as a list of its list-of-characters representation for each iteration. The list-of-characters of "1" is ["1"]. There is one iteration, so we have [["1"]].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     streak = ''
3     for c in str(n):## [STATE]c=["1"][/STATE] [STATE]str(n)=[["1"]][/STATE]
4         streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
5     return streak
