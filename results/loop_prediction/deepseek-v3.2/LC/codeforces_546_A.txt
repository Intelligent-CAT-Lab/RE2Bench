[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the code step by step.

First, parse the input "1 1 1":
- k = 1
- n = 1
- w = 1

Line 2: sum = 0

Line 3: for i in range(1, w + 1)
Since w = 1, w + 1 = 2, so range(1, 2) generates only one value: i = 1.

During the loop:
- Loop iteration 1: i = 1, range object is range(1, 2) for each iteration, so range(1, w + 1) = range(1, 2) for each iteration.
Line 4: sum += k * i → sum += 1 * 1 → sum = 1

Loop ends after 1 iteration.

Therefore:
- i = [1]
- range(1, w + 1) = [range(1, 2),] but since we need to repeat for each iteration, it will be [range(1, 2)] once.

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :## [STATE]i=[1][/STATE] [STATE]range ( 1 , w + 1 )=[range(1, 2)][/STATE]
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n :
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
