[THOUGHT]
The inputs are:
nums = [7, 1, 2]
elements = [9, 0, 3]

The loop runs `for i in range(len(elements))`.
len(elements) = 3, so range(3) yields values 0, 1, 2.

We trace each iteration:

Iteration 1: i = 0
nums.pop() removes and returns the last element of nums: nums = [7, 1, 2] → pop() → returns 2, nums becomes [7, 1]
result.append(2) → result = [2]

Iteration 2: i = 1
nums.pop() removes last element: nums = [7, 1] → pop() → returns 1, nums becomes [7]
result.append(1) → result = [2, 1]

Iteration 3: i = 2
nums.pop() removes last element: nums = [7] → pop() → returns 7, nums becomes []
result.append(7) → result = [2, 1, 7]

Loop ends.
So i takes values: 0, 1, 2
range(len(elements)) stays the same in each iteration: range(3), but we need to represent it as a list of the same value repeated for each iteration: so [range(3), range(3), range(3)].
Alternatively, since the range object is constant, we could represent it as the same range repeated, but the instruction says to repeat its value for K times if it stays the same.
