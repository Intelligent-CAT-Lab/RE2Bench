[THOUGHT]
We are given num="1" and l=3. The while loop condition is l > len(num). len(num)=1.
First iteration: condition true (3>1). At line 3, l=3, num="1". Then t becomes "0", l becomes 2.
Second iteration: condition true (2>1). At line 3, l=2, num="1". Then t becomes "00", l becomes 1.
Third check: condition false (1>1 false). So loop runs 2 times.
Thus, the state of l at the start of each iteration is [3, 2]. The state of num, which does not change, is ["1", "1"] (repeated for each iteration).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(num, l):
2     t = ""
3     while l > len(num):## [STATE]l=[3, 2][/STATE] [STATE]num=["1", "1"][/STATE]
4         t += '0'
5         l -= 1
6     return t + num
