[THOUGHT]
The input `lst` is `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.  
The loop iterates over each element in order:  
1st iteration: `i = -1.4`  
2nd iteration: `i = 17.9`  
3rd iteration: `i = 18.9`  
4th iteration: `i = 19.9`  

`lst` stays the same in each iteration, so for 4 iterations, it repeats 4 times.  

So:  
`i = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`  
`lst = [[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]]`

6         squared += math.ceil(i)**2
7     return squared
