[THOUGHT]
The code initializes variables `r`, `D`, and `x` from the input `2 100 105`.
So, `r = 2`, `D = 100`, `x = 105`.

The loop `for i in range(10):` will execute 10 times.
The variable `i` takes values from 0 to 9.
The expression `range(10)` creates a range object, but in the context of the prompt format, it usually asks for the iterable itself or the range object representation repeated for each iteration. Following the common pattern for these tasks involving `range()`, `range(10)` is the iterable being looped over. However, usually, the prompt expects the state of variables. Let's look at `i`.

Iteration 1:
`i` = 0
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 105 - 100` = 210 - 100 = 110.

Iteration 2:
`i` = 1
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 110 - 100` = 220 - 100 = 120.

Iteration 3:
`i` = 2
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 120 - 100` = 240 - 100 = 140.

Iteration 4:
`i` = 3
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 140 - 100` = 280 - 100 = 180.

Iteration 5:
`i` = 4
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 180 - 100` = 360 - 100 = 260.

Iteration 6:
`i` = 5
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 260 - 100` = 520 - 100 = 420.

Iteration 7:
`i` = 6
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 420 - 100` = 840 - 100 = 740.

Iteration 8:
`i` = 7
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 740 - 100` = 1480 - 100 = 1380.

Iteration 9:
`i` = 8
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 1380 - 100` = 2760 - 100 = 2660.

Iteration 10:
`i` = 9
`x` is updated: `x = 2 * 2660 - 100` = 5320 - 100 = 5220.

The variable `range(10)` is a bit tricky in these prompts. Usually, it asks for the value of the iterable. Since it's a range object, it stays `range(0, 10)` throughout. However, sometimes these prompts expect the expanded list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` repeated, or simply the range object `range(0, 10)` repeated. Given the strict type matching often implied, and `range(10)` being constant, I will repeat the representation `range(0, 10)` 10 times. Wait, standard Python `range(10)` evaluates to `range(0, 10)`. Let's assume the state asked is indeed the evaluation of that expression at each step, which is constant.

Let's list the states for `i`:
`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

Let's list the states for `range(10)`:
It's the object being iterated over. It doesn't change.
`[range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10), range(0, 10)]`
