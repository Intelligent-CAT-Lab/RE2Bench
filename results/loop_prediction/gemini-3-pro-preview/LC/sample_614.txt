[THOUGHT]
The function `f` searches for the N-th occurrence (where N is `occ`) of `substr` in `text`, starting from the end of the string (reverse search). It modifies `text` in each iteration by slicing it up to the found index.

Tracing the execution:

**Initialization:**
`text` = "zjegiymjc"
`substr` = "j"
`occ` = 2
`n` = 0

**Iteration 1:**
- Loop condition `True` holds.
- `text` is currently "zjegiymjc".
- `i = text.rfind(substr)`: We search for "j" from the right in "zjegiymjc". The last "j" is at index 7.
- `i` = 7.
- `i == -1` is False.
- `n` (0) == `occ` (2) is False.
- `else` block executes:
  - `n` becomes 1.
  - `text` becomes `text[:i]`, which is "zjegiymjc"[:7] -> "zjegiym".

**Iteration 2:**
- Loop condition `True` holds.
- `text` is currently "zjegiym".
- `i = text.rfind(substr)`: We search for "j" from the right in "zjegiym". The last "j" is at index 1.
- `i` = 1.
- `i == -1` is False.
- `n` (1) == `occ` (2) is False.
- `else` block executes:
  - `n` becomes 2.
  - `text` becomes `text[:i]`, which is "zjegiym"[:1] -> "z".

**Iteration 3:**
- Loop condition `True` holds.
- `text` is currently "z".
- `i = text.rfind(substr)`: We search for "j" from the right in "z". It is not found.
- `i` = -1.
- `if i == -1:` is True.
- The loop breaks.

So, the loop runs 3 times.
The state of `True` is simply `True` for each iteration.
The state of `text` at the start of each iteration is:
1. "zjegiymjc"
2. "zjegiym"
3. "z"

1 def f(text, substr, occ):
2     n = 0
3     while True:## [STATE]True=[True, True, True][/STATE] [STATE]text=["zjegiymjc", "zjegiym", "z"][/STATE]
4         i = text.rfind(substr)
5         if i == -1:
6             break
7         elif n == occ:
8             return i
9         else:
10             n += 1
11             text = text[:i]
12     return -1
