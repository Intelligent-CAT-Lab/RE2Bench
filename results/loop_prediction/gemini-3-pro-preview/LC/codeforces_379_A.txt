[THOUGHT]
The input is `a=80, b=970`.
`x` is initialized to `80`, `h=0`, `s=0`.

The code contains two `while` loops. The annotation request is specifically for the first `while` loop at line 5: `while x > 0`.

Tracing the first loop:
1.  **Iteration 1:** `x` is 80. The condition `x > 0` is true. We record `'x'=80`. Inside the loop: `x` becomes 79, `h` becomes 1, `s` becomes 1.
2.  **Iteration 2:** `x` is 79. Condition true. Record `'x'=79`. Inside: `x` becomes 78, `h` becomes 2, `s` becomes 2.
3.  **Iteration 3:** `x` is 78. Condition true. Record `'x'=78`. Inside: `x` becomes 77...
...
This continues, decrementing `x` by 1 each time.
The loop stops when `x` reaches 0.
The last iteration happens when `x` is 1. The condition `1 > 0` is true. We record `'x'=1`. Inside: `x` becomes 0.
The next check `0 > 0` is false, and the loop terminates.

So, the captured states for `x` at the start of the loop body are 80, 79, 78, ..., 1.

The second loop condition is `while s // b != 0`.
At the end of the first loop, `s` will be equal to `a` (which is 80), because it incremented 80 times.
`b` is 970.
`s // b` is `80 // 970`, which is 0.
Since `0 != 0` is false, the second loop never runs. There are no state markers requested for the second loop regardless.

Summary of `x` states: `[80, 79, 78, ..., 1]`.
