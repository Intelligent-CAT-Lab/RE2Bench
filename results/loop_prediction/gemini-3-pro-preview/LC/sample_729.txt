[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two strings `s1` and `s2`.
Input `s1` is "abcdefghabc".
Input `s2` is "abc".

Line 2: `res` is initialized to `[]`.
Line 3: `i = s1.rfind(s2)`
`s1.rfind(s2)` searches for the highest index where `s2` is found in `s1`.
"abc" is found at index 0 and index 8. The highest index is 8.
So, `i` becomes 8.

Line 4: `while i != -1:`
Iteration 1:
- check condition: `i` is 8, which is not -1. True.
- Inside the loop, we record the state of `i`. So `i` = 8.
Line 5: `res.append(i + len(s2) - 1)` -> `res.append(8 + 3 - 1)` -> `res.append(10)`. `res` is `[10]`.
Line 6: `i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)` -> `i = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 8)`
This searches for "abc" in `s1[0:8]`, which is "abcdefgh".
"abc" is found at index 0.
So, `i` becomes 0.

Iteration 2:
- check condition: `i` is 0, which is not -1. True.
- Inside the loop, we record the state of `i`. So `i` = 0.
Line 5: `res.append(i + len(s2) - 1)` -> `res.append(0 + 3 - 1)` -> `res.append(2)`. `res` is `[10, 2]`.
Line 6: `i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)` -> `i = s1.rfind("abc", 0, 0)`
This searches for "abc" in `s1[0:0]`, which is "".
"abc" is not found. `rfind` returns -1.
So, `i` becomes -1.

Iteration 3:
- check condition: `i` is -1. False. Loop terminates.

So the states for `i` at the start of the loop body (Line 4) are: 8, then 0.

Summary of [STATE]i=??[/STATE]:
1. i = 8
2. i = 0

1 def f(s1,s2):
2     res = []
3     i = s1.rfind(s2)
4     while i != -1:## [STATE]i=[8, 0][/STATE]
5         res.append(i+len(s2)-1)
6         i = s1.rfind(s2, 0, i)
7     return res
