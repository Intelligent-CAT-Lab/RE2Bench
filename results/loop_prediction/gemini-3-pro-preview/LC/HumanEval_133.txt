[THOUGHT]
The input `lst` is `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.

The function iterates through each element `i` in `lst`.

**Iteration 1:**
*   `i` becomes `-1.4`.
*   `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
*   `math.ceil(-1.4)` is `-1`.
*   `squared` becomes `0 + (-1)**2 = 1`.

**Iteration 2:**
*   `i` becomes `17.9`.
*   `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
*   `math.ceil(17.9)` is `18`.
*   `squared` becomes `1 + 18**2 = 1 + 324 = 325`.

**Iteration 3:**
*   `i` becomes `18.9`.
*   `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
*   `math.ceil(18.9)` is `19`.
*   `squared` becomes `325 + 19**2 = 325 + 361 = 686`.

**Iteration 4:**
*   `i` becomes `19.9`.
*   `lst` remains `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
*   `math.ceil(19.9)` is `20`.
*   `squared` becomes `686 + 20**2 = 686 + 400 = 1086`.

We need to annotate the state of `i` and `lst` at the beginning of the loop line.

`i` states: `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`
`lst` states: `[[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9], [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]]`
