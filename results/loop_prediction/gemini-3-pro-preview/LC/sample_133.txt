The function `f` takes a list `nums` and a list `elements`.
Input:
`nums` = `[7, 1, 2]`
`elements` = `[9, 0, 3]`

Line 2: `result` is initialized to `[]`.

Line 3: The loop iterates over `range(len(elements))`.
`len(elements)` is 3.
`range(len(elements))` generates the sequence `0`, `1`, `2`. This range object stays constant throughout the loop initiation, but in Python 3, `range` returns a range object. However, usually, for these traces, we format the range as a list or tuple representation of the sequence or just the object if it's constant. Let's look at the example format. The example shows the whole list `t` being repeated. So for `range(...)`, it's likely expecting the instance of the range object or a representation of it repeated for each iteration. Wait, the example `t` was the *iterable*. Here, `range(len(elements))` is the iterable. So I should probably show the `range` object for each iteration. A range object is usually represented like `range(0, 3)`.

Let's trace the loop:

Iteration 1:
- `i` takes the first value from `range(0, 3)`, which is `0`.
- Loop body: `result.append(nums.pop())`. `nums` becomes `[7, 1]`.

Iteration 2:
- `i` takes the second value, which is `1`.
- Loop body: `result.append(nums.pop())`. `nums` becomes `[7]`.

Iteration 3:
- `i` takes the third value, which is `2`.
- Loop body: `result.append(nums.pop())`. `nums` becomes `[]`.

The loop finishes.

Variables to state:
`i`: The values are `0`, `1`, `2`.
`range(len(elements))`: This expression creates a range object `range(0, 3)`. Since the prompt asks for the state of the expression `range(len(elements))` inside the loop logic, and since it evaluates once to create the iterator, but we usually represent the value of the variable or expression at that line. The iterable `range(0, 3)` exists and yields values. I will represent it as `range(0, 3)` repeated for each iteration, or perhaps as a list `[0, 1, 2]` to show what is being iterated over, but strictly python returns a range object. Let's stick to the range object notation which is standard representation. Or better yet, since the variable being asked is `range(len(elements))`, which is the thing being iterated over, it effectively is the object `range(0, 3)`.

Wait, usually "STATE" implies the value of that expression at the moment the line is executed.
Steps:
1. `i` = 0. `range(len(elements))` = range(0, 3).
2. `i` = 1. `range(len(elements))` = range(0, 3).
3. `i` = 2. `range(len(elements))` = range(0, 3).

The list form for `i` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
The list form for `range(len(elements))` is `[range(0, 3), range(0, 3), range(0, 3)]`.
