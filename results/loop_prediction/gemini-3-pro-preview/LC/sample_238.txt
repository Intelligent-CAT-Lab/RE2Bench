[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list of lists `ls` and a number `n`.
It iterates through each sublist `i` in `ls`.
It checks if the first element of the sublist `i[0]` is equal to `n`.
If it is, it sets `answer` to that sublist `i`.
Finally, it returns `answer`.

Input:
`ls` = `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
`n` = `1`

Loop Trace:
Iteration 1:
- `i` takes the first element of `ls`: `[1, 9, 4]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
- Check `i[0] == n` -> `1 == 1` is True. `answer` becomes `[1, 9, 4]`.

Iteration 2:
- `i` takes the second element of `ls`: `[83, 0, 5]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
- Check `i[0] == n` -> `83 == 1` is False.

Iteration 3:
- `i` takes the third element of `ls`: `[9, 6, 100]`
- `ls` remains `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`
- Check `i[0] == n` -> `9 == 1` is False.

End of loop.
