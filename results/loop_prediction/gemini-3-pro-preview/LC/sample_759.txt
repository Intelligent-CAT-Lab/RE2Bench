The function `f` searches for all occurrences of the substring `sub` within the string `text` and returns a list of their starting indices. Using the method `text.find(sub, starting)`, it looks for the next occurrence starting from the current index.

Input:
`text` = "egmdartoa"
`sub` = "good"

1.  **Initialization**:
    - `index` = []
    - `starting` = 0

2.  **First Iteration (Line 4)**:
    - The condition `starting != -1` is checked. `starting` is 0. Condition is True.
    - **Line 5**: `starting = text.find("good", 0)`. The substring "good" is NOT found in "egmdartoa". So `find` returns -1.
    - `starting` becomes -1.
    - **Line 6**: `if starting != -1` (i.e., `if -1 != -1`) is False.
    - The block inside the `if` is skipped.

3.  **Second Iteration (Line 4)**:
    - The condition `starting != -1` is checked. `starting` is -1. Condition is False.
    - The loop terminates.

So, the variable `starting` is checked at the start of the loop twice:
1.  When its value is 0.
2.  When its value is -1 (after the update inside the first iteration).

Wait, the prompt format asks for the state *at the loop marker*. The marker is on line 4: `while starting != -1:`.
- Iteration 1: `starting` is 0 at the check.
- Iteration 2: `starting` is -1 at the check.

Therefore, the state list for `starting` should be `[0, -1]`.

Summary of `starting` values at Line 4:
- 1st check: 0
- 2nd check: -1

8             starting += len(sub)
9     return index
