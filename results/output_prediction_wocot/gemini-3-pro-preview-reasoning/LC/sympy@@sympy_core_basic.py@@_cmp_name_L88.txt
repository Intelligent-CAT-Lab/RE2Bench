The function `_cmp_name` compares two SymPy classes (types) to determine their ordering. It primarily relies on a list `ordering_of_classes` defined in `sympy.core.numbers` which establishes a canonical order for number types.

1.  **Identify Inputs**:
    *   `x`: The class `sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit`. Its `__name__` is `"ImaginaryUnit"`.
    *   `y`: The class `sympy.core.numbers.Pi`. Its `__name__` is `"Pi"`.

2.  **Logic Execution**:
    *   The function retrieves the names `n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"` and `n2 = "Pi"`.
    *   It checks `n1 == n2`, which is `False`.
    *   It checks `issubclass(y, Basic)`. `Pi` inherits from `Basic` in SymPy, so this is `True` (condition `not ...` is `False`).
    *   It attempts to find the indices of these names in `ordering_of_classes`.
        *   In standard SymPy, `ordering_of_classes` includes both. The order typically lists `ImaginaryUnit` before `Pi` (e.g., `..., 'ComplexInfinity', 'ImaginaryUnit', 'Pi', ...`).
        *   Therefore, `i1` (index of "ImaginaryUnit") will be less than `i2` (index of "Pi").
    *   If for some reason they are not in the list, the fallback is string comparison: `"ImaginaryUnit"` comes alphabetically before `"Pi"` ("I" < "P").
    *   The return statement is `(i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2)`.
    *   Since `i1 < i2`:
        *   `i1 > i2` is `False` (0).
        *   `i1 < i2` is `True` (1).
        *   Result is `0 - 1 = -1`.
