The function `math_to_image` calculates the metrics of the given math string `$x^2$` using `MathTextParser` and returns the `depth` (distance from the baseline to the bottom of the bounding box). For the mathematical expression `$x^2$`, the character `x` sits on the baseline and the superscript `2` is above it. In standard fonts used by Matplotlib (like DejaVu Sans or Computer Modern), the character `x` does not have a descender, so the depth is 0.

Therefore, the return value `depth` is `0` (or `0.0`).
