Based on the provided Python code and input, the function `__invert__` is called on a `Permutation` object. The input state specifies `_size` as 5 and `_array_form` as `null` (None). In the context of `Permutation` objects (specifically in SymPy, which this code mimics or uses), a permutation with a set size but implicitly missing array form typically represents the Identity permutation.

The Identity permutation of size 5 corresponds to the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
The inverse of the Identity permutation is itself: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
The function creates a new `Permutation` object (using `_af_new`) with this inverted array.
The resulting object will have `_array_form` set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` determined by the length of the array, which is 5.

```
{
    "_array_form": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "_size": 5
}
