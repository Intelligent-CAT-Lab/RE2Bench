The function `sstr` uses `StrPrinter` to convert the expression to a string. The input `expr` is described as an object with `_array_form` as `null` and `_size` as `6`. Based on the attributes `_array_form` and `_size`, `expr` corresponds to a SymPy `Permutation` object. Although `_array_form` is listed as `null` in the JSON representation (likely indicating default/identity or omitted detail), the `_size` of 6 with no modification suggests an identity permutation of size 6.

In the provided code for `_print_Permutation`, we inspect the logic:
```python
def _print_Permutation(self, expr):
    from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation, Cycle
    if Permutation.print_cyclic:
        # ... logic for cyclic printing ...
    else:
        s = expr.support()
        if not s:
            if expr.size < 5:
                return 'Permutation(%s)' % str(expr.array_form)
            return 'Permutation([], size=%s)' % expr.size
        # ... logic for non-empty support ...
```

By default in SymPy, `Permutation.print_cyclic` is `False`.
An identity permutation of size 6 has an empty support (`s = []`).
The size `6` is not less than `5`.
Therefore, the function executes `return 'Permutation([], size=%s)' % expr.size`.
Substituting `expr.size` with `6`, the result is `'Permutation([], size=6)'`.

    "output": "Permutation([], size=6)"
