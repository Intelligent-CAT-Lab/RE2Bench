Based on the provided Python code, the `as_content_primitive` method is defined in the `Expr` class as follows:

```python
    def as_content_primitive(self, radical=False, clear=True):
        return (S.One, self)
```

This method simply returns a tuple containing `S.One` (which represents the number 1) and `self` (the instance itself), ignoring the arguments `radical` and `clear`.

The input provided is:
```json
{
    "self": {
        "nargs": "{1}"
    },
    ...
}
```

This JSON representation for `self` suggests the object corresponds to a SymPy object whose string representation is `"{1}"` (likely a `FiniteSet(1)` or similar structure, or a dummy object behaving as such).

Therefore, the return value of the function will be the tuple `(1, self)`. In the output JSON format, this tuple is represented as a list, and the SymPy objects are typically represented by their string or numeric values. `S.One` becomes `1`, and `self` becomes `"{1}"`.
