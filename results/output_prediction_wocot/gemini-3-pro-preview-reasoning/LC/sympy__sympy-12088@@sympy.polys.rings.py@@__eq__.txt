Based on the provided code and input:

1.  **Analyze the Input State (`p1` and `p2`)**:
    *   `p1` is passed as an argument (corresponding to `self` in the functionality but `p1` in the definition provided).
    *   The JSON representation of `p1` is `{"_hash": 1651261762238379522}`. `PolyElement` inherits from `dict`. In the provided JSON format, the absence of key-value pairs representing the polynomial terms (monomials to coefficients) implies that the dictionary is empty or the coefficients are not provided.
    *   An empty `PolyElement` dictionary corresponds to the zero polynomial (0).
    *   `p2` is the integer `1`.

2.  **Trace the Execution of `__eq__(p1, p2)`**:
    *   The method signature is `def __eq__(p1, p2):`.
    *   **Check 1**: `if not p2:`
        *   `p2` is `1`, which is truthy. The condition is `False`.
    *   **Check 2**: `elif isinstance(p2, PolyElement) and p2.ring == p1.ring:`
        *   `p2` is `1` (type `int` or `Integer`), not an instance of `PolyElement`. The condition is `False`.
    *   **Check 3**: `elif len(p1) > 1:`
        *   Based on the JSON input having no dictionary entries, `len(p1)` is 0. `0 > 1` is `False`.
    *   **Else Block**:
        *   `return p1.get(p1.ring.zero_monom) == p2`
        *   Since `p1` is treated as an empty dictionary, `p1.get(...)` returns the default value `None`.
        *   The comparison becomes `None == 1`.
        *   This evaluates to `False`.

3.  **Conclusion**: The polynomials (or polynomial and scalar) are not equal. The output is `False`. Since the output format is JSON, the boolean value is represented as `false`.
