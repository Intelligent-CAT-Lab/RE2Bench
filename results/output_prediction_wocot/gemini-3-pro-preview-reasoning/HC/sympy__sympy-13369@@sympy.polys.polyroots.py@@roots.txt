Based on the code structure and the provided JSON structure for the output, the function `roots` calculates the roots of a polynomial and their multiplicities. The structure `{"0": XXX}` indicates that the root `0` is found. The simplest polynomial having `0` as a root is `x` (i.e., `Poly([1, 0], x)`), which has the root `0` with multiplicity `1`. Assuming a standard minimal test case for the presence of root `0`:
