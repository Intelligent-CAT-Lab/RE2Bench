The output of the function `factor_terms` with the input `expr = "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"` is predicted as follows:

The function `factor_terms` uses `sympify` to parse the string into a SymPy expression: $\frac{2x}{a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2}$.
It then calls `expr.as_content_primitive()` which identifies the common factor $a^2$ in the denominator term $(a^2 x^2 - a^2 y^2)$.
The content extracted is $a^2$ (from the denominator, so effectively $1/a^2$ or $a^{-2}$ in the product) and $2$ from the numerator.
The primitive part becomes $\frac{x}{x^2 - y^2}$.
Recombining these into the expression yields $\frac{2x}{a^2(x^2 - y^2)}$.
The string representation of this SymPy expression is `"2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))"`.
