Based on the provided Python code and input, the function `periodicity` calculates the period of the given trigonometric expression.

Input: `f = "csc(2*x) - sec(x)"`
Implicit Symbol: `x`

Execution analysis:
1.  `periodicity` is called with `f`. `f` is first simplified.
2.  `csc(2*x)` has a period of $\pi$ (since $\csc(t)$ is $2\pi$, $\csc(2x)$ is $2\pi/2 = \pi$).
3.  `sec(x)` has a period of $2\pi$.
4.  The expression is a sum/difference of these terms. `periodicity` handles `Add` expressions by calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the periods of the individual terms (via the helper logic `_periodicity` which typically delegates to `lcm_list`).
5.  $LCM(\pi, 2\pi) = 2\pi$.
6.  The function returns `2*pi`.
