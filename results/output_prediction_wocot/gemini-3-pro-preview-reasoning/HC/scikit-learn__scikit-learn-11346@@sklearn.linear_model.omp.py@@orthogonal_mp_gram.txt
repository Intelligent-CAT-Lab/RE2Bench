The output of the function `orthogonal_mp_gram` is predicted based on the input matrices provided. The function performs Orthogonal Matching Pursuit.

1.  **Inputs**:
    *   `Gram`: A 12x12 matrix (parsed from string). `Gram[1, 1]` is observed to be `1.0`.
    *   `Xy`: A 12x1 vector (parsed from string). The maximum absolute value is at index 1 (`2.33249979`).
    *   `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1.

2.  **Algorithm Execution**:
    *   Initialization: `n_active = 0`.
    *   Iteration 1:
        *   The algorithm finds the index `lam` maximizing `abs(alpha)` (initially `Xy`). The maximum value in `Xy` is `2.33249979` at index **1**.
        *   `lam = 1`.
        *   The diagonal element `Gram[1, 1]` is `1.0`.
        *   The step size `gamma` is calculated. Since it's the first step and diagonal is 1, `gamma = Xy[1] / sqrt(Gram[1, 1])^2 = 2.33249979 / 1.0 = 2.33249979`.
        *   This value is stored in the coefficient vector at index 1.
        *   `n_active` becomes 1.
        *   The loop terminates because `n_active` equals `n_nonzero_coefs` (1).

3.  **Result**:
    *   The resulting coefficient vector has `0.0` everywhere except at index 1, where it is `2.33249979`.
    *   `np.squeeze` converts the (12, 1) array to a 1D array of shape (12,).
