The function `decode_cf_datetime` attempts to decode numeric dates into datetime objects.
Based on the input:
- `units`: "days since 0001-01-01"
- `calendar`: "366_day"
- `num_dates`: `null` (which implies `None` in Python, but the presence of `ExplicitlyIndexedNDArrayMixin` in the function calls suggests it's a mock or wrapped object that behaves like an array, likely containing the value `0` for testing purposes, as `nanargmin` would fail on `NaN` or empty arrays).

1.  `num_dates` acts as an array `[0]` (1D array with one element, 0 days since reference).
2.  `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` is tried but fails because "366_day" is not a standard calendar.
3.  `_decode_datetime_with_cftime` is called.
4.  `cftime.num2date([0], units="days since 0001-01-01", calendar="366_day")` is executed.
    - Reference date: 0001-01-01.
    - Delta: 0 days.
    - Result: `0001-01-01 00:00:00` in `366_day` calendar.
    - Object type: `cftime.DatetimeAllLeap`.
5.  The function returns a numpy array containing this object.
