The execution of `_symbolic_factor_list` involves the following steps:
1.  **Input Parsing**: The function receives `expr="cos(phi)"`, `opt={"fraction": true}`, and `method="factor"`. The expression is converted to a SymPy object `cos(phi)`.
2.  **Argument Extraction**: `Mul.make_args(expr)` returns `(cos(phi),)`. The loop iterates with `arg = cos(phi)`.
3.  **Polynomial Construction**: `_poly_from_expr(cos(phi), opt)` is called. Since `cos(phi)` is a symbolic function not belonging to the coefficients domain, it is treated as a generator. The coefficients are integers (1), so the domain is inferred as `ZZ` (Integers). The resulting polynomial is `Poly(cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`.
4.  **Factorization**: The `method` is "factor", so `poly.factor_list()` is called. `Poly(cos(phi), ...)` is irreducible over `ZZ`. The function returns `(1, [(Poly(cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ'), 1)])`.
5.  **Aggregation**: The main loop collects these factors. `rv` (a defaultdict) aggregates the count for the factor. The count is 1.
6.  **Return**: The function returns a tuple containing the overall coefficient (1) and a list of `(factor, multiplicity)` tuples.
