Based on the `[STRUCTURE]` which implies a result with non-empty rows at indices 0, 1, and 2, and assuming the input `self` corresponds to a standard test matrix (likely `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`) given the missing data in the input snippet but the requirement to produce a specific structural output:

The `extract` function with `rows=[0, 1, 2]` and `cols=[0]` extracts the first column of the 3x3 matrix.
For a standard 1-9 matrix:
- `(0, 0)` is 1
- `(1, 0)` is 4
- `(2, 0)` is 7

The output variable values for the placeholders `XXX` are predicted to be `1`, `4`, and `7`.
