Based on the provided code and input, the `transform` method is called with `X=None` (JSON `null`).

1.  `transform` calls `check_is_fitted(self)`. Since `n_features_in_` is present in `self` (value 2), this check passes.
2.  `transform` calls `_transform(X, ...)`.
3.  `_transform` calls `_check_n_features(X, reset=False)`.
4.  `_check_n_features` calls `_num_features(X)`.
5.  Inside `_num_features(None)`:
    *   `X` is converted to a numpy array: `np.asarray(None)` results in a 0-d array `array(None, dtype=object)` with shape `()`.
    *   It checks `hasattr(X, 'shape')` which is True.
    *   It checks `len(X.shape) <= 1`. `len(())` is 0, which is `<= 1`.
    *   It raises `TypeError`.
6.  `_check_n_features` catches the `TypeError`.
7.  Since `reset` is False and `n_features_in_` (2) is present, it raises a `ValueError` with the message: `X does not contain any features, but OneHotEncoder is expecting 2 features`.
