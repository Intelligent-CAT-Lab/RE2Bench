The `Equivalent.__new__` method is called with `evaluate=None` (defaults to `True`) and two arguments: `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)` (which is an `Or` object) and `Q.even(X*Z)` (which is an `AppliedPredicate` object).

1.  **Sympify**: The input strings are converted to SymPy objects:
    *   `arg1`: `Or(Q.even(X), Q.even(Z))`
    *   `arg2`: `Q.even(X*Z)`
2.  **Argset**: A set is created `argset = {arg1, arg2}`. Both are distinct objects (neither `__eq__` nor `__hash__` merges them). `Q.even(X*Z)` is not automatically equivalent to the Disjunction of evens in SymPy's core without specific refinement.
3.  **Filtering**: Neither are Numbers or Booleans (True/False).
4.  **Relational Check**: `Q.even` represents a predicate (AppliedPredicate), not a Relational (like Eq, Lt). The logic for simplifying relational pairs is skipped.
5.  **Termination Checks**: `len(argset)` is 2 (not <= 1). `True` and `False` are not present.
6.  **Creation**: The method calls `super().__new__(cls, *ordered(argset))`.
    *   `ordered` sorts the arguments.
    *   The `default_sort_key` and `_nodes` (complexity) are used.
    *   `Q.even(X*Z)` has a smaller node count (Predicate -> Mul -> X, Z) compared to `Or(Q.even(X), Q.even(Z))` (Or -> Pred -> X, Pred -> Z).
    *   Also, by class name, `AppliedPredicate` comes before `Or`.
    *   Thus, `Q.even(X*Z)` is placed first.
7.  **Result**: An `Equivalent` object is returned with the sorted arguments.

The string representation of the `Or` object `Or(Q.even(X), Q.even(Z))` typically uses the infix `|` operator: `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`.
The string representation of `Q.even(X*Z)` is `Q.even(X*Z)`.
The `Equivalent` object is represented as `Equivalent(arg1, arg2)`.
