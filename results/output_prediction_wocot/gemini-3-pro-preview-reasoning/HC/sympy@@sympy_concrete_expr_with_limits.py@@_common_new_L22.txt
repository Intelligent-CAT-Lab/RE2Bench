The output of the function `_common_new` is a tuple containing the processed function (sympified), the list of limits (normalized to Tuples), and the orientation flag.

Given the input:
- `cls`: `Integral`
- `function`: `"1"` $\rightarrow$ `Sympify("1")` $\rightarrow$ `1` (Integer)
- `symbols`: `["x"]` $\rightarrow$ processed as limits. `_process_limits` converts a single symbol `x` to `Tuple(x)` (representing an indefinite integral). The limits becomes a list: `[Tuple(x)]`.
- `discrete`: `False` (passed to `_process_limits`).
- `kwargs`: `{}`.

The execution flow in `_common_new`:
1.  `function` is sympified to `1`.
2.  `_process_limits("x", discrete=False)` is called. It identifies "x" as a symbol (simulated) and returns `limits=[Tuple(x)]`, `orientation=1`.
3.  The loop over `limits` checks for Range objects (length 4), which matches nothing here.
4.  The loop checking `cls == type(function)` fails (`Integral != Integer`).
5.  Piecewise processing is skipped as `1` has no Piecewise atoms.
6.  Returns `(1, [Tuple(x)], 1)`.

The string representation of this tuple with SymPy objects is `(1, [(x,)], 1)`.
