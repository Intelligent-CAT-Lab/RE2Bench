Based on the provided Python function `_mask_nc` and the input, here is the predicted execution:

1.  **Input Parsing**: The input arguments are `eq = "2 - 2*cos(phi)"` and `name = None`. In the context of usage with `_mask_nc`, `eq` serves as a SymPy expression. The string `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"` is interpreted as a standard algebraic expression where `phi` is a generic symbol, `cos` is the cosine function, and `2` is a number.
2.  **Commutativity Check**: The function checks `if expr.is_commutative:`.
    *   `phi` is a standard Symbol, which is commutative by default.
    *   `2` is an Integer, which is commutative.
    *   `cos(phi)` is a standard function with a commutative argument, so it is commutative.
    *   The combination `2 - 2*cos(phi)` is therefore commutative.
3.  **Return**: Since `expr.is_commutative` is true, the function immediately returns `(eq, {}, [])`.
4.  **Output Formatting**: The return value is a tuple containing the expression, an empty dictionary, and an empty list. In JSON format, the expression is represented by its string form, the dictionary by `{}`, and the list by `[]`.
