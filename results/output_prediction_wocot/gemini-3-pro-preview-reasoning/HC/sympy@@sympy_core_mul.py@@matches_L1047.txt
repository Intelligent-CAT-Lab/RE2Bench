Based on the analysis of the provided Python code and the input:

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    *   `self`: `"sin(x*a_)**n_*cos(x*a_)**m_"` is sympified to a SymPy expression. We assume `a_`, `n_`, `m_` are treated as Wildcards (standard pattern matching variables).
    *   `args`: `expr` is `"cos(x)"`, which is sympified to `cos(x)`.

2.  **`matches` Execution**:
    *   The `matches` method is called on the `Mul` object `P = sin(x*a_)**n_ * cos(x*a_)**m_`.
    *   The target expression is `E = cos(x)`.
    *   Both are commutative, so `_matches_commutative` is invoked.

3.  **Commutative Matching (`_matches_commutative`)**:
    *   The method attempts to match the factors of the pattern `P` against the factors of the expression `E` (`[cos(x)]` and identity `1`).
    *   It decomposes `P` into `wild_factors`: `[sin(x*a_)**n_, cos(x*a_)**m_]`.
    *   **Step 1**: It tries to match one of the wild factors against `cos(x)`.
        *   Trying `sin(x*a_)**n_` vs `cos(x)`: Structural mismatch (`sin` vs `cos`).
        *   Trying `cos(x*a_)**m_` vs `cos(x)`:
            *   Specific match: `cos(x*a_)**m_.matches(cos(x))`.
            *   Base: `cos(x*a_)` matches `cos(x)`. Argument `x*a_` matches `x`, yielding `a_ = 1` (since `1*x = x`).
            *   Exponent: `m_` matches implicit exponent `1`.
            *   Result so far: `{a_: 1, m_: 1}`.
    *   **Step 2**: It substitutes the found matches into the remaining pattern and matches it against the remaining expression.
        *   Remaining pattern: `sin(x*a_)**n_`. Substituted with `a_=1` -> `sin(x)**n_`.
        *   Remaining expression (`E` divided by matched part `cos(x)`): `1`.
        *   Match `sin(x)**n_` vs `1`:
            *   `base**exp` matches `1` if `exp = 0`.
            *   Result: `{n_: 0}`.
    *   **Conclusion**: All parts matched successfully. The combined dictionary is `{a_: 1, m_: 1, n_: 0}`.

4.  **Output Generation**:
    *   The output structure requires the values for `a_`, `m_`, and `n_`.
    *   `a_`: 1
    *   `m_`: 1
    *   `n_`: 0
