The `transform` method calculates the factor matrix $W$ given the input $X$ and the fixed components $H$, such that $X \approx WH$, by minimizing the Frobenius norm using Coordinate Descent (CD) solver (initially $W$ is zeros).

Based on the provided input $X$ and `components_` (H) and simulating the NNLS solving process for each row:
