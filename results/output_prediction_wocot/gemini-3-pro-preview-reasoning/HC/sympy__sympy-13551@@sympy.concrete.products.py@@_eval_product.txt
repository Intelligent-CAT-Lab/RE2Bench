The output of `_eval_product` will be the symbolic product expression constructed by the method. The method identifies the term as a `Mul` (product) of two `Add` expressions (one being a `Pow` with exponent -1). It processes the numerator and denominator separately as polynomials in `i`.

For the numerator $i^2 + 5i + 4 = (i+1)(i+4)$, with roots $-1, -4$. 
The product for a factor $(i-r)$ is $\text{RisingFactorial}(a-r, n-a+1)$.
Here $a = u+v$, $n = u-1$, so $n-a+1 = -v$.
Terms are $\text{RisingFactorial}(u+v+1, -v)$ and $\text{RisingFactorial}(u+v+4, -v)$.

For the denominator $i^2 + 2i - 3 = (i-1)(i+3)$, with roots $1, -3$.
Terms are $\text{RisingFactorial}(u+v-1, -v)$ and $\text{RisingFactorial}(u+v+3, -v)$.
Since these are in the denominator, they appear in the divisor of the result.

The function returns the raw product without simplification (like canceling gamma terms) as the `simplify` step is not part of `_eval_product`'s logic for polynomial/rational terms blocks shown.
