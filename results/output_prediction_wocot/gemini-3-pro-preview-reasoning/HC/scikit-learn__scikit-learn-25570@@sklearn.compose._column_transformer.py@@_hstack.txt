Based on the provided input and the behavior of the `_hstack` method in `ColumnTransformer`, here is the predicted output.

The input `Xs` is provided as `null` in the JSON arguments. Given that `output_indices_` in `self` indicates that the transformer has been fitted and expects columns (indices 0-2 and 2-3), `Xs` would physically contain data (likely a list of numpy arrays) in a real execution. The presence of `null` for `Xs` (and also for `transformers_` in `self`) indicates that complex data structures (like arrays and estimator objects) have been replaced by `null` in this serialized execution trace. Consequently, the output of `_hstack`, which is the concatenation of these arrays (`np.hstack(Xs)`), will also be represented as `null`.
