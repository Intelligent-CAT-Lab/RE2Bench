The output of the function `collect` with the given input `expr="_Dummy_373"` and `syms=None` (assuming `syms` effectively acts as an empty list or the operation acts as an identity when no valid symbols are provided/found) will be the expression itself. The input `expr` is converted to a symbol `_Dummy_373`. Since no valid symbols are specified to collect terms for, the function returns the expression unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "_Dummy_373"
}
```
