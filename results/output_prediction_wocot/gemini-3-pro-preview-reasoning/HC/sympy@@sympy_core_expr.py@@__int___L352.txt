The function execution proceeds as follows for the input `self = "1 + I"` (conceptually `1 + 1j` in SymPy):

1.  The `__int__` method is called on the expression `1 + I`.
2.  It checks `if not self.is_number`. `1 + I` contains no free symbols (`I` is a constant), so `is_number` is `True`. The check passes.
3.  It checks `if not self.is_comparable`.
    *   `is_comparable` calls `self._eval_is_comparable()`.
    *   This evaluates the expression to floating-point precision. `1 + I` evaluates to approximately `1.0 + 1.0*I`.
    *   The definition of `is_comparable` requires the result to be a real number. Since the imaginary part (`1.0`) is non-zero, this check fails (returns `False`).
4.  Since `self.is_comparable` is `False`, the method raises a `TypeError` with the message `'Cannot convert non-comparable expression to int'`.
