The output of `_eval_expand_mul` will be the input expression itself, as there are no terms that can be distributed (expanded) in `-sin(phi)**2` according to the logic of the provided function. The expression is a multiplication of `-1` and `sin(phi)**2`, neither of which is an `Add` expression.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "-sin(phi)**2"
}
```
