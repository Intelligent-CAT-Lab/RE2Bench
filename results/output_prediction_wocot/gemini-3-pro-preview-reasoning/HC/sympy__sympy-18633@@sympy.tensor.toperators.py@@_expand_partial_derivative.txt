The `_expand_partial_derivative` method computes the expansion of a partial derivative (e.g., using the product rule). The method first calls `_contract_indices_for_derivative` to determine the indices, free indices, and dummy indices of the resulting expression. It then constructs a new object `obj` with these attributes. It may further expand the expression if it is a `TensAdd` or `TensMul`.

Given the input `self` has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` as `null`, but the function calculates them from `self.expr` and `self.variables` (which are derived from `self.args`, not shown but implied to be generic scalar or compatible tensor objects for this prediction context), and considering the trace involves tensor operations but we lack specific index names, the most standard "default" or "scalar" behavior implies empty lists for indices if no indices are introduced or all are contracted/scalar. However, based on the presence of index manipulation functions in the trace, contraction likely occurs or indices are handled. Without specific input names, generic empty lists are the plausible structural placeholders for a scalar result or when arguments are not provided to define specific indices.
