Based on the provided Python code and input, here is the predicted output.
The input string `("exp(x)" + "exp(-x)")/(y*("exp(x)" - "exp(-x)"))` (interpreting the escaped quotes as part of the intended mathematical expression structure which might have been malformed in the description, effectively simplified to the mathematical expression $\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{y(e^x - e^{-x})}$) represents a standard identity.
The `simplify` function converts the string to a SymPy expression.
The term $\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^x - e^{-x}}$ is recognized as the hyperbolic cotangent, $\coth(x)$.
The variable $y$ in the denominator remains.
Thus, the expression simplifies to $\frac{\coth(x)}{y}$.
The `simplify` function in the code calls `exptrigsimp` which performs this conversion.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "coth(x)/y"
}
```
