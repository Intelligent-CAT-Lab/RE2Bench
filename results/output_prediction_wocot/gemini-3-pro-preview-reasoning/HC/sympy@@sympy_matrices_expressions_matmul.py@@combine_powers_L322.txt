The function `combine_powers` takes a matrix multiplication expression and attempts to combine adjacent powers of the same base matrix (e.g., $A \cdot A^2 \to A^3$). 

Based on the input `mul = "X*Z"`:
1.  The input string "X*Z" is interpreted as a multiplication of two matrices, $X$ and $Z$.
2.  `mul.as_coeff_matrices()` is called. Assuming $X$ and $Z$ are matrix symbols, the coefficient (factor) is 1, and the matrices list (`args`) is `[X, Z]`.
3.  The logic iterates through the matrices list.
    *   It compares the adjacent pair `A=X` and `B=Z`.
    *   It checks if they are inverses of each other (they are not).
    *   It checks if they are powers of the same base matrix (they are distinct symbols "X" and "Z", so they are not).
    *   Since no combination rule applies (base $X \neq Z$), $Z$ is simply appended to the new argument list.
4.  The function reconstructs the multiplication expression with `newmul(1, *new_args)`, which results in a `MatMul` of $X$ and $Z$.
5.  The string representation of the resulting expression is `"X*Z"`.
