The input specifies a call to the `_complement` method on a `Set` object `self` with an argument `other`.
`self` is represented as `{}` in the input, which suggests it is an empty `Set` or an object with no relevant state properties shown (implies empty set in this context).
`other` is represented as a `FiniteSet` with `_elements` being `frozenset({1})`.

Based on the execution trace, `sympy.sets.sets.FiniteSet._contains` is called. This indicates that `self.contains` delegates to `FiniteSet._contains`. This implies `self` is treated as a `FiniteSet`. Since the JSON input for `self` is empty, it represents an empty `FiniteSet` (which behaves like an empty set).

The `_complement` method calculates `other - self` (the set difference).
Since `other` is `{1}` and `self` is `{}`, the difference is `{1}`.
The logic within `_complement`:
1. It calls `sift(other, ternary_sift)`.
2. `ternary_sift` checks `self.contains(x)` for each `x` in `other`.
3. For `x=1` (from `other`), `self` (empty) does not contain `1`. `contains` returns `False`.
4. `sifted[False]` will contain `[1]`.
5. The result is `Union(FiniteSet(1), EmptySet)`, which simplifies to `FiniteSet(1)`.

The output is this resulting `FiniteSet`. The structure requires the `_elements` attribute. For `FiniteSet(1)`, `_elements` is `frozenset({1})`.
