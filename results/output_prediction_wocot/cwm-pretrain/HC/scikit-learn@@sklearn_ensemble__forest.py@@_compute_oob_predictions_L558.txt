Given the provided code and input, the task is to predict the output of the `_compute_oob_predictions` function, which is part of a scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier model. 

The function iterates over each estimator (decision tree) in the ensemble and computes the out-of-bag (OOB) predictions. These are the predictions made for the samples that were not used in the training of a specific decision tree. The predictions are averaged across all trees to obtain the OOB prediction for each sample.

Key points to consider:
- There are 40 decision trees (`n_estimators`), each trained on a bootstrap sample of the data.
- The function computes the predictions for each estimator on the out-of-bag samples, then averages these predictions to get the final OOB prediction for each sample.
- The `predict_proba` method is used to get the class probabilities, and these are averaged across all estimators.

Given that the input data has 150 samples and the model is a classifier with two classes, the output of `_compute_oob_predictions` will be an array of shape (150, 2, 1), representing the average probability of each class across all estimators for each sample.

The OOB predictions for each sample will be averaged across all 40 estimators, and if a sample does not have any OOB predictions (i.e., it was included in all bootstrap samples), a warning is raised, and the OOB prediction is set to the average prediction across all samples.
