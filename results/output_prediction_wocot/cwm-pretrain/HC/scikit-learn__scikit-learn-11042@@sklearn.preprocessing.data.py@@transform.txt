I will analyze the function's logic and functions called during the execution to determine the correct output.
First, let's understand what this OneHotEncoder class does:
1. It's a transformer that converts categorical features to one-hot encoded features.
2. It can handle sparse data.
3. It stores some properties during fitting:
   - `n_values_`: The number of unique categories for each feature
   - `feature_indices_`: The cumulative indices used for constructing the sparse matrix
   - `active_features_`: For sparse output, this helps select only the active features

Let's look at the `transform` method:
1. It calls `check_array` to validate the input array
2. It checks if the input has negative values
3. It verifies the input shape matches what was seen during fitting
4. It creates a mask to check if any category values are unknown
5. It creates the one-hot encoded matrix using sparse matrices
6. For sparse=True, it returns the matrix filtered by active features

For the input data:
```python
X = [[1, 1, 1]]
```

The transformer's properties are:
- n_values_ = [4, 3, 2] (number of unique categories for each feature)
- feature_indices_ = [0, 4, 7, 9] (cumulative indices)
- active_features_ = [0, 3, 5, 6, 8] (which features are active in sparse output)

Let's calculate the expected output:
1. For feature 0 (value 1), the index is 0 + 1 = 1
2. For feature 1 (value 1), the index is 4 + 1 = 5
3. For feature 2 (value 1), the index is 7 + 1 = 8

So we get sparse matrix with data array [1, 1, 1] and column indices [1, 5, 8], with one row (since we have one sample) and 9 columns total (from feature_indices_[-1] = 9).

Let me format this into the required structure:
```
{
    "_shape": "[1 9]",
    "maxprint": "7",
    "indices": "[1 3 4]",
    "indptr": "[0 3]",
    "data": "[1. 1. 1.]"
}
```

I'll now format this as the expected response:
<tool: bash>
[OUTPUT]
{
    "_shape": "[1 9]",
    "maxprint": "7",
    "indices": "[1 3 4]",
    "indptr": "[0 3]",
    "data": "[1. 1. 1.]"
}
[/OUTPUT]
</tool>
