[/OUTPUT] <</sys>> Sure, I'd be happy to help. It looks like you're trying to define a function `f` that takes an argument `pointer`, which is a string representing a mathematical expression. The function should return a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key is `"output"` and the value is the string `"sin(x)**2 + 'cos(x)'**2"`.

Here's the function definition in Python:

```python
def f(pointer):
    return {"output": "sin(x)**2 + 'cos(x)'**2"}
```

You can then call the function with any input, and it will always return the same dictionary:

```python
print(f("any input"))
```

This will output:

```python
{'output': "sin(x)**2 + 'cos(x)'**2"}
```

Note that this function always returns the same output, regardless of the input, because it doesn't actually use the input in its calculation. If you want the function to actually evaluate the mathematical expression in `pointer`, you would need to use a library like SymPy or NumPy to parse and evaluate the expression.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
