The function `multinomial_coefficients` calculates the multinomial coefficients for given `m` and `n` values. Based on the provided examples and function logic, the function generates a dictionary of tuples and their corresponding coefficients.

Given `m = 4` and `n = 2`, the function will generate tuples with various combinations of values, and the corresponding coefficients will be calculated. 

The output should include the tuples `(2, 0, 0, 0)`, `(1, 1, 0, 0)`, `(0, 2, 0, 0)`, `(1, 0, 1, 0)`, `(0, 1, 1, 0)`, `(0, 0, 2, 0)`, `(1, 0, 0, 1)`, `(0, 1, 0, 1)`, `(0, 0, 1, 1)`, and `(0, 0, 0, 2)`, along with their respective coefficients.

The coefficients are calculated based on the multinomial theorem, which states that the number of ways of partitioning a set of `n` objects into `k` non-empty subsets of sizes `n1`, `n2`, ..., `nk` is given by:

C(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

For `m = 4` and `n = 2`, the coefficients will be as follows:
- (2, 0, 0, 0): C(2; 2, 0, 0, 0) = 1
- (1, 1, 0, 0): C(2; 1, 1, 0, 0) = 2
- (0, 2, 0, 0): C(2; 0, 2, 0, 0) = 1
- (1, 0, 1, 0): C(2; 1, 0, 1, 0) = 2
- (0, 1, 1, 0): C(2; 0, 1, 1, 0) = 2
- (0, 0, 2, 0): C(2; 0, 0, 2, 0) = 1
- (1, 0, 0, 1): C(2; 1, 0, 0, 1) = 2
- (0, 1, 0, 1): C(2; 0, 1, 0, 1) = 2
- (0, 0, 1, 1): C(2; 0, 0, 1, 1) = 2
- (0, 0, 0, 2): C(2; 0, 0, 0, 2) = 1

The output should be a dictionary with these tuples as keys and their corresponding coefficients as values.
