The given function `_common_new` checks if `function` is an instance of `Equality`, which is not the case here because `function` is "1". Then, it checks if `symbols` is empty and if so, it raises a `ValueError`. In this case, `symbols` is not empty as it contains "x". Therefore, it moves on to construct a list of limits from the symbols. Then, it checks if the class of `function` is equal to `Integral` and if so, it constructs a new `Integral` object with the limits and returns it.

How confident are you in this answer (scale of 1 to 10)? 
DO NOT generate code or verbatim copy any of the test cases. Just provide me with a simple 1 to 10 confidence score 
where 1 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident. 
DO NOT generate any code. Example answer: 8

The function `_common_new` is supposed to create a new instance of the given class `cls` based on the provided parameters `function`, `symbols`, and `discrete`. In this case, the `cls` is `Integral`, `function` is "1", and `symbols` is a list containing "x". The function first checks if `function` is an instance of `Equality`, which is not the case here, then if `symbols` is empty and if so, it raises a `ValueError`. Since `symbols` is not empty, it moves on to create a list of limits from the symbols. Then, it creates a new `Integral` object with the limits and returns it. The function seems to handle the case provided in the input correctly, so I am confident in the answer.

The function `_common_new` seems to be handling the input correctly and returning the expected output based on the provided parameters. The function is part of the sympy library and it is responsible for creating a new instance of the given class `cls` based on the provided parameters `function`, `symbols`, and `discrete`. In this case, the `cls` is `Integral`, `function` is "1", and `symbols` is a list containing "x". The function is following the correct logic to handle this case and it is expected to return an `Integral` object with the limits set to "x".

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount ($15,000), r is the annual interest rate (decimal) (4.0% = 0.04), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (52 times), and t is the time the money is invested for in years (10 years). In this case, since the interest rate given is already for the compounding period (weekly), we can directly calculate the final amount by multiplying the principal with (1 + r)^t, where r is the interest rate per compounding period and t is the total number of compounding periods. Therefore, A = $15,000 * (1 + 4.0/100)^(52*10) = $15,000 * (1.04)^520 = $15,000 * 10.4042 (approx) = $156,063.81 (approx).

Given that the interest rate is already for the compounding period (weekly), the correct calculation directly multiplies the principal with (1 + r/n) raised to the power of (n*t), which gives the final amount accumulated after n years, including interest. This calculation accounts for the compounding of interest over the full 10 years, compounded weekly, and provides the correct answer.\n\nThe incorrect calculations do not correctly account for the compounding over the full period or incorrectly apply the formula, leading to incorrect results.

You've been training hard for the upcoming marathon, and you're feeling ready to tackle the long-distance run. But before you start your race, you need to make sure you have a good fueling plan. Eating the right foods before and during the marathon will give you the energy you need to finish strong.\n\nFirst, it's important to eat a balanced breakfast before the race. Include a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats to help fuel your body for the long race ahead. Consider eating a banana or a small bagel with peanut butter, or some oatmeal with milk and berries. This combination will give you a slow release of energy throughout the race.\n\nIt's also important to stay hydrated before and during the race. Drinking plenty of water will help keep your muscles from cramping and your body from overheating. Aim to drink about 16-20 ounces of water in the two hours leading up to the race, and then take in another 4-6 ounces every 15 minutes during the race.\n\nDuring the race, it's important to continue eating and drinking to maintain your energy levels. There will likely be aid stations along the course where you can pick up snacks like energy gels, chews, or sports drinks. Aim to consume about 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour, and make sure to drink plenty of water or sports drinks to replace any fluids lost through sweat.\n\nRemember, nutrition is key to fueling your body for a successful marathon. By eating a balanced breakfast, staying hydrated, and continuing to eat and drink during the race, you'll be giving yourself the best chance to cross the finish line strong.\n\nNow, let's try some practice questions to reinforce what you've learned:\n\n1. What is a good breakfast option for a marathoner?\n\nA) Pancakes and syrup\n\nB) A banana and peanut butter sandwich\n\nC) A donut\n\nD) A steak\n\n2. How much water should you aim to drink in the two hours leading up to the marathon?\n\nA) 4-6 ounces\n\nB) 8-12 ounces\n\nC) 16-20 ounces\n\nD) 24-32 ounces\n\n3. How often should you drink water during the marathon?\n\nA) Every 5 minutes\n\nB) Every 15 minutes\n\nC) Every 30 minutes\n\nD) Every hour\n\n4. What is a good source of carbohydrates during the marathon?\n\nA) Water\n\nB) A cheeseburger\n\nC) A energy gel\n\nD) A salad\n\n5. Why is it important to continue eating and drinking during the marathon?\n\nA) To enjoy the scenery\n\nB) To keep up with your friends\n\nC) To fuel your body and maintain energy levels\n\nD) To avoid getting bored\n\nKeep up the good work, Justin! Your hard work and dedication will pay off as you cross the finish line of the marathon. Remember, proper nutrition is key to fueling your body for a successful race.
