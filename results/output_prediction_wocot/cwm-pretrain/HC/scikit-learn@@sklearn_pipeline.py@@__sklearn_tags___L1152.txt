We need to determine the output of the `__sklearn_tags__` method for a Pipeline object. The `__sklearn_tags__` method returns a Tags object with information about the type of estimator, input and output tags, etc. 

Given the input, we have a Pipeline object with two steps: "kernel_pca" and "Perceptron". 

For the first step ("kernel_pca"), it's a KernelPCA object. Since it's not None and not 'passthrough', we should check its tags. 

For the second step ("Perceptron"), it's a Perceptron object. Since it's not None and not 'passthrough', we should check its tags. 

The output should be a Tags object with the estimator_type set to the type of the last step ("Perceptron"), the input_tags set to the input_tags of the first step, and the target_tags set to the target_tags of the last step. 

We should not include any of the transformer_tags, regressor_tags, or classifier_tags from the steps, as these are not applicable to the Pipeline object. 

Therefore, the output should be a Tags object with the estimator_type set to "Perceptron", the input_tags set to the input_tags of the first step (which are not specified in the input, so we will leave it as None), and the target_tags set to the target_tags of the last step (which are not specified in the input, so we will leave it as None).
