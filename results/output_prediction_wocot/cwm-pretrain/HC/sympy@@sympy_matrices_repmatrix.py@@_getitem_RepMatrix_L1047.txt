Given the function `_getitem_RepMatrix` and the input provided, the function is expected to return the value at the specified indices within a matrix. Based on the structure and the example provided, here's the expected output when querying the matrix at indices (0, 0):

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": cos(phi)
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

The function `_getitem_RepMatrix` accesses the matrix using the key (0, 0) and retrieves the corresponding element, which is cos(phi). This is deduced from the domain matrix representation provided, where the element at position (0, 0) is cos(phi).
