    <think>
        The function `_stringify_py37` is called with an annotation that has attributes `__module__` and `__doc__`. The `__module__` is set to "test_util_typing", and `__doc__` is `None`. 

        First, the function checks if the `__module__` of the annotation is "typing". This is not the case here, as the `__module__` is "test_util_typing". 

        Then, it checks if the annotation has a `__qualname__` attribute, which is not the case. Next, it checks for a `__origin__` attribute, which is also not present. 

        Since none of these conditions are met, the function returns the string representation of the annotation using `repr(annotation)`. The annotation has an attribute `__module__` set to "test_util_typing" and `__doc__` set to `None`. Therefore, the string representation will be "test_util_typing.__doc__:None".
