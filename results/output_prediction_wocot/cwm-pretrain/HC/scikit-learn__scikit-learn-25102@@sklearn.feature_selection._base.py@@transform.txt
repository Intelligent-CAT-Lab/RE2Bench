The transform function in the GenericUnivariateSelect class is responsible for selecting features based on a univariate score function. The selection is performed by the _transform function which checks the support (mask) and returns either an empty array (if no features are selected) or a subset of the input data X (if features are selected). The output_config_dense variable is used to determine whether to return a numpy array or a pandas DataFrame, but this is only relevant if X is a pandas DataFrame.

Given the provided input:
- The estimator has been fitted with 3 features (n_features_in_ = 3).
- The scores_ array is [0 0 1], indicating that only the third feature is selected.
- The pvalues_ array is [0 0 1], which seems irrelevant for the transformation process.
- The X input is None, which means we cannot directly infer the output structure from it.

Since the transform method validates the input data using _validate_data and calls _transform, and given that no features are selected (mask.sum() would be 0), we expect the _transform function to return an empty array. The output_config_dense variable is set to 'default', which suggests that a numpy array is expected as output.

Therefore, the predicted output should be a numpy array with 0 columns, as no features are selected.
