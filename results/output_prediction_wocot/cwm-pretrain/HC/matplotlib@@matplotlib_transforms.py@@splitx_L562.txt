The `splitx` method is called on a `Bbox` instance with the arguments `[0.85, 0.85]`. The method calculates the horizontal splits of the bounding box at the specified fractional positions along the x-axis. The `extents` of the bounding box are obtained from the `get_points()` method, which returns the coordinates of the bounding box corners. These extents are then used to compute the widths of the segments at each specified fractional position, and new `Bbox` instances are created for each segment.

Given the bounding box with coordinates [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]] and the split positions [0.85, 0.85], the method will split the bounding box into three segments:
1. From the left edge to the position 0.85 of the bounding box width.
2. From the position 0.85 to the next position 0.85 (essentially a single point).
3. From the position 0.85 to the right edge of the bounding box.

Each segment will be represented by a new `Bbox` instance with the appropriate coordinates.
