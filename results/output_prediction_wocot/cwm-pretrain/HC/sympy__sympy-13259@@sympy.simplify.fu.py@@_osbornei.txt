Based on the provided Python function and input data, we can determine the output of the function. The function `_osbornei` takes an expression `e` and a dummy variable `d` as input and returns the transformed expression using various trigonometric identities. Since the input expression `e` is an empty object with `nargs` as an empty dictionary, it seems like an empty or identity expression.
