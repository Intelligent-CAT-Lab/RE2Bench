Let's go through the steps to get the output of `_eval_pos_neg` for the input `-phi`.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function is initialized with `self = "-phi"` and `sign = 1`.
   - Variables `saw_NON` and `saw_NOT` are set to `False`.

2. **Iterating through `self.args`**:
   - The arguments of `self` (which is `-phi`) are accessed via `self.args`, resulting in a single element `["phi"]` since the minus sign is considered as a negative multiplier.
   - The iteration starts with `t = "phi"`.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For `t = "phi"`:
     - `t.is_extended_positive` is `False`, so we proceed to the next condition.
     - `t.is_extended_negative` is `False`, so we proceed to the next condition.
     - `t.is_zero` is `False`, so we proceed to the next condition.
     - `t.is_extended_nonpositive` is `False`, so we proceed to the next condition.
     - `t.is_extended_nonnegative` is `True` (since "phi" is non-negative), so `saw_NON` is set to `True`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - After processing all elements of `self.args`, the function returns `None` because the conditions for returning `True` or `False` are not met and there is no explicit return statement provided for other cases.

Therefore, the final output of `_eval_pos_neg` is `None`.
