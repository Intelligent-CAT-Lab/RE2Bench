### code execution
<think>
To solve this problem, we need to understand the functionality of the `_rank` function in sympy and how it processes a matrix to determine its rank. The `_rank` function uses a combination of matrix permutations and row reduction to compute the rank of a given matrix `M`. We are given a matrix `M` which is a 3x3 matrix with all elements as 1, and the `iszerofunc` which is the `_iszero` function from sympy.utilities.

The process involves checking the dimensions of the matrix and then using a series of helper functions to reduce the matrix and identify the rank. Given that the matrix has all elements as 1, the row reduction should result in a matrix where all rows except the first are zeros, indicating a rank of 1 for the matrix. This is because the rows are linearly dependent, and thus, there is only one independent row.

Therefore, the output of the `_rank` function for the given matrix `M` should be `1`.
