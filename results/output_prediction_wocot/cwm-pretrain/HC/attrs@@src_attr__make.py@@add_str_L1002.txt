- The _ClassBuilder instance is created with `cls` as `Error`.
- `__attrs_pre_init__` is not present in `Error`, so `_has_pre_init` is `False`.
- `__attrs_post_init__` is not present in `Error`, so `_has_post_init` is `False`.
- `__setattr__` is overridden since `_has_custom_setattr` is `True`.
- Since `is_frozen` is `False` and there are no validators or converters, `__setattr__` is not overridden again.
- Since `is_slotted` is `False`, `__str__` cannot be generated.
- `add_str` method is called which raises a `ValueError`.
- The error message is `__str__ can only be generated if a __repr__ exists.`.
- The output will be the error message raised.
