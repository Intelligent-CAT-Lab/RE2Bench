You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.

<think>
The function `should_bypass_proxies` is called with the URL "http://localhost:48329/" and `no_proxy` set to `null`. The function first checks if `no_proxy` is `None`, which it is not in this case since it's `null`, so it proceeds to parse the URL. The hostname "localhost" is valid and not `None`, so it skips the initial return condition.

Since `no_proxy` is `null`, the function checks if `is_ipv4_address("localhost")` is true. "localhost" is not an IPv4 address, so it moves to the else block. The hostname with the port is set to "localhost:48329". The function then iterates over the no_proxy hosts, but since there are no hosts (as `no_proxy` is `null`), this loop does nothing.

Next, the function sets the `no_proxy` environment variable back to its original value and calls `proxy_bypass(parsed.hostname)`. The `proxy_bypass` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on the context, it likely checks if the hostname "localhost" should bypass proxies. Assuming it returns `False` (as there's no indication it should bypass), the function proceeds to the final return statement, which is `False`.

Therefore, the output of the function will be `False`.
