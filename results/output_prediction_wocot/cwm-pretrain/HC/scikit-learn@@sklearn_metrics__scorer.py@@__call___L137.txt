The function `__call__` in the class `_MultimetricScorer` is a method that evaluates a list of scorers on a given estimator with provided data. It processes the provided scorers, routing metadata as necessary, and applies the scores, returning a dictionary of scores.

Given the input, the estimator is an instance of `EmpiricalCovariance`, and we are passing a 2D array `[[0.88895051, -0.94884286, -0.77838201, -0.99349011, -0.74907652]]` to the score method. Since the scorer is a function `score`, it will be called with the estimator and the provided data.

The `score` function of `EmpiricalCovariance` computes the log likelihood of the data given the covariance model. This is typically a numerical value. Given the input data is a single sample, the score function will return a scalar value representing the log likelihood.

Based on the provided input and the functionality of the `score` method in `EmpiricalCovariance`, the expected output is a dictionary with the score key and a numerical value as the value. Since routing and sample weights are not considered in this case, the result should be the score of the single sample.
