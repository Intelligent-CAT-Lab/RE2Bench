Based on the provided code and input, the `_hstack` function is being called with no actual data in the `Xs` input parameter. This results in an empty hstack operation.

Since the output is expected to be a numpy array and the `sparse_output_` flag is set to False, the function will return an empty numpy array.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": []
}
[/OUTPUT]
