Given the provided Python function 'roots' and the input data which is an empty dictionary for both 'self', 'args', and 'kwargs', the function should be called with no arguments as all are empty. The function 'roots' expects at least a polynomial expression or coefficients list to compute the roots. However, with no arguments, the function cannot proceed with any computation related to polynomial roots.

The structure provided for the output expects a single key "0" with a corresponding value to be filled in with 'XXX' as a placeholder. Since the function 'roots' with no arguments cannot produce any meaningful output, the appropriate response in this context would be an error or indication of an incorrect usage.

Given the constraints and the nature of the function call with no arguments, the predicted output would indicate that the function was called incorrectly or with insufficient data to produce a result as intended by the 'roots' function's design.
