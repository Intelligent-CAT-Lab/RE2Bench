To predict the output of the `add_hash` function with the given input, we need to analyze the function's behavior based on the provided inputs and the structure of the class and attributes.

First, let's understand the function:
- The `add_hash` function is part of a class builder for creating a hash method for a class.
- It uses the `_make_hash_script` function to generate a script for the hash method.
- The `self` input contains information about the class and its attributes.
- The `args` and `kwargs` inputs are empty, which means we're dealing with a basic case where no additional arguments or keyword arguments are provided.

Given the inputs, the class does not have custom attributes or any special hashing requirements beyond the default, and it's not frozen or using a cache for the hash. Therefore, the `add_hash` function will create a simple hash method that uses the object's attributes for hashing.

The structure of the output is expected to be a dictionary with a key `"output"` and a placeholder `XXX` for the actual output value. The actual output value will be the hash script and any associated global variables (globs) as a tuple.

Based on the typical output of `_make_hash_script` for a non-frozen, non-cached hash, and considering the inputs, the output should be a script that defines a `__hash__` method for the class and a dictionary of global variables that the hash method might use.

Here is the predicted output in the specified format:
```json
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": [
        "def __hash__(self):\n    return hash((123456,  # Hash of the class name\n        self.attr1,  # Assuming attr1 is an attribute of the class\n        self.attr2,  # Assuming attr2 is another attribute of the class\n        ))",
        {}
    ]
}
[/OUTPUT]
```

Note: The actual hash values and attribute names in the predicted output are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual values and attributes of the class once the specific class and attributes are known.
