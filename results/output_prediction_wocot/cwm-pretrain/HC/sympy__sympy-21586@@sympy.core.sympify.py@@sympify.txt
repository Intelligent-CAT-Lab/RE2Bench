To predict the output of the `sympify` function, given the input `"2500/pi"` with the keyword argument `strict=True`, we first need to understand what `sympify` does and how it works. The function `sympify` attempts to convert its argument into a SymPy object, if it is not already one.

In this case, the argument passed is the string `"2500/pi"`. Since the `strict` argument is set to `True`, `sympify` will raise a `SympifyError` if it cannot convert the input into a SymPy object. However, `"2500/pi"` is a valid mathematical expression that SymPy can parse and convert into its internal representation, which is a `Mul` object representing the product of the integer 2500 and the symbol `pi`.

Therefore, the output of `sympify` should be a SymPy object representing `2500*pi`. We can represent this in the required output format as follows:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "2500*pi"
}
```
