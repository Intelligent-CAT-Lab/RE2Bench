The function `_preprocess` takes a list of arguments (`args`) and an expression (`expr`), and processes them to handle symbols, dummies, and functions. It returns a tuple of (`argstrs`, `expr`), where `argstrs` is a list of processed argument strings and `expr` is the modified expression.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `argstrs = []` is initialized to store the processed argument strings.
   - `dummify` is set based on the `_dummify` attribute of `self`. If `_dummify` is `False`, it checks if any argument is an instance of `Dummy`, which will set `dummify` to `True`.

2. **Argument Processing**:
   - Each argument in `args` is processed to check if it's an iterable, a symbol, a dummy, or a function.
   - If an argument is an iterable, it recursively processes the elements.
   - If an argument is a symbol or a matrix symbol, it checks if it's safe to represent it directly. If not, it converts it to a dummy variable.
   - If an argument is a function, it converts it to a dummy variable.
   - Other types of arguments are converted to strings.

3. **Expression Processing**:
   - The `expr` is modified based on the processed arguments, replacing symbols and functions with their dummy equivalents.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns a tuple of (`argstrs`, `expr`).

Given the inputs, the function will process an empty list of arguments and the expression `"sin(x)**2"`. Since `args` is empty, no arguments will be processed, and `argstrs` will remain empty. The expression `"sin(x)**2"` will be processed, but since there are no symbols or functions to replace, it will remain unchanged.
