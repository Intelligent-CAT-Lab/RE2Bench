The predicted output of the `combine_powers` function, given the input `X*Z`, is:
```
{
    "output": "X*Z"
}
```

Note: Since `X` and `Z` are not matrices or expressible in terms of matrices, the function does not combine any powers or simplify the expression further. Therefore, the output remains the same as the input.
