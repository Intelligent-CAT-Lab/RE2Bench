Given the input data, the output for the `copy` method of the `Path` class is as follows:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": {
        "_vertices": "array([[0., 0.],\n       [1., 1.]])",
        "_codes": "array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)",
        "_interpolation_steps": 1,
        "_simplify_threshold": 0.1111111111111111,
        "_should_simplify": false,
        "_readonly": false
    }
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Note: The `copy` method of the `Path` class returns a shallow copy of the object. In this case, since the `vertices`, `codes`, and other attributes are not mutable and the class doesn't have any other mutable attributes, the output of the `copy` method will be a new `Path` object with the same attributes as the input object. The values of the attributes are the same as in the input object because they are immutable.
