First, analyze the `GridSpecBase.get_grid_positions` method which is called with a figure object. The method retrieves subplot layout parameters including left, right, bottom, top, hspace, and wspace values. It then calculates cell heights and widths, and determines positions for each subplot. Given the input, the figure has default subplot parameters and dimensions.

Let's break down how these parameters are calculated:

1. **Subplot Parameters**: The method calls `self.get_subplot_params(fig)` which should provide default values from the figure (left=0.125, bottom=0.1, right=0.9, top=0.9, wspace=0.2, hspace=0.2) if not specified. These values determine the overall layout within the figure.

2. **Cell Sizes**: With 1 row and 1 column and the calculated total width and height, cell sizes are determined. Since there's only one cell, no additional spacing (wspace and hspace) between cells is needed.

3. **Output Format**: The output should be an array with four parts:
   - Bottoms of subplots (fig_bottoms)
   - Tops of subplots (fig_tops)
   - Lefts of subplots (fig_lefts)
   - Rights of subplots (fig_rights)
   The format is a tuple with each part being a NumPy array representing the respective positions.

Since the figure is empty and defaults are used, we can predict the output based on standard Matplotlib subplot layout calculations.</think>
