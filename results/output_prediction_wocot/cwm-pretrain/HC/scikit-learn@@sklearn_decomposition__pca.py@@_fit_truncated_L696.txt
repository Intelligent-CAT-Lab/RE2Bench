The function `_fit_truncated` is a method of the `PCA` class in scikit-learn. It performs a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the input data matrix `X` to reduce its dimensionality. The function first checks the parameters and initializes some variables. It then computes the mean and variance of the data, centers the data, and performs the SVD. Finally, it computes the explained variance and noise variance, and returns the result.

In this case, the function is called with `n_components=3`, `svd_solver='arpack'`, and `X` is a 5x10 array. The output of the function is expected to be the result of the truncated SVD, which is an array of shape (5, 10).
