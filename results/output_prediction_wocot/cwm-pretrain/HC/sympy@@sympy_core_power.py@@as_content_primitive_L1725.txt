Sure, I'll help you predict the output of the `as_content_primitive` function given the provided input.

First, let's analyze the input:
- `self` is "sqrt(2)", which represents the square root of 2.
- `radical` is False.
- `clear` is False.

Looking at the implementation of `as_content_primitive`, we can see that when `radical` is False, the function recursively removes a Rational from all arguments and returns that (content) and the new self (primitive). Since `self` is "sqrt(2)", which is not a Rational, the function will return `(S.One, self.func(b, e))`.

Now, let's predict the output:
- The output should be `(1, sqrt(2))`.

Here is the predicted output in the required format:
```
{
    "output": (1, sqrt(2))        
}
```
