I need to predict the output of `_set_params`, given the provided inputs. Here is my reasoning and response:

<think>
The function `_set_params` is called with the argument `attr="_transformers"` and `kwargs={"trans1__with_mean": false}`. 
In this case, `attr` is not present in `params`, so the code inside the `if attr in params:` block is not executed.
Then, the code gets the list of transformers using `getattr(self, attr)`. Since `attr` is not in `params`, the list of transformers remains unchanged.
Finally, the function returns `self`, which is the original `ColumnTransformer` object with the `transformers` attribute unchanged.
</think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "transformers": null,
    "remainder": "drop",
    "n_jobs": 1,
    "transformer_weights": null
}
