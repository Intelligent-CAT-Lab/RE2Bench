**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. The function `_eval_is_algebraic` is being called on an instance of the `Pow` class.
2. The first condition checks if the base of the power is zero or if it is equal to 1.
3. The function `_is_one` is called on the base, which tries to subtract 1 from the base and check if the result is zero.
4. If the base is zero or one, the function returns `True`.
5. The function then checks if the base is `S.Exp1`, which is the exponential function.
6. If the base is `S.Exp1`, it checks if the exponent is rational.
7. If the exponent is rational, the function returns `False`.
8. If the exponent is not rational, the function returns the result of `s.is_algebraic`, where `s` is the result of applying the function to the base and exponent.
9. The function then checks if the base is algebraic and if the exponent is algebraic.
10. If both the base and exponent are algebraic, the function returns `True` if the base is not zero and not one.
