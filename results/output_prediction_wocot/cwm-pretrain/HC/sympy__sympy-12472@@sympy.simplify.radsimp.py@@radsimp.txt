<think> Begin analysis of radsimp function

The radsimp function is a simplification function for mathematical expressions, particularly focused on rationalizing expressions. Here's how we'll analyze it:

1. Function definition and imports
2. Internal helper functions (_num, ispow2, handle)
3. Main simplification logic

Key observations about the inputs:
- The input expression is "1/(a - b)"
- symbolic=False means we only simplify if the denominator is a number
- max_terms=1 means we'll only attempt to rationalize simple expressions

Given these inputs, we can predict the output: </think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "1/(a - b)"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

The function will return the original expression unchanged because:
1. When symbolic=False, we only rationalize if the denominator is a number
2. The denominator here is "a - b", which is symbolic
3. There's no simplification or rationalization possible within the function's logic given these constraints
