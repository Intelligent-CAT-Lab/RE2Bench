The function format_data is called with the value 0.11. The steps in the function are as follows:

1. The exponent `e` is calculated as the floor of the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the input `value`. For `value = 0.11`, this gives `e = -1`.

2. The significand `s` is calculated as `value / 10^e`, which for `value = 0.11` and `e = -1` gives `s = 1.1`.

3. The function `_format_maybe_minus_and_locale` is called to format the significand `s`. Since `s = 1.1` is not an integer, the format `'%1.10g'` is used, resulting in `significand = '1.1'`.

4. The exponent is formatted as well. Using the format `'%d'`, the exponent is `'-1'`.

5. Since `_useMathText` and `_usetex` are both false, the output is constructed as `'1.1e-1'`.


The final output is the string '1.1e-1'.
