<think>
To determine the output of the function `_row_reduce_list`, we need to understand how the function works.

The function takes a matrix `mat`, the number of rows and columns in the matrix, a value `one` representing the multiplicative identity (typically 1), and two functions `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc` for checking if an element is zero and simplifying expressions, respectively.

The function performs row reduction on the matrix, finding suitable pivots and eliminating elements below the pivot. The process involves checking if elements are zero, swapping rows, and performing row operations to reduce the matrix.

Given the input matrix and the parameters, the function will perform row reduction to produce a reduced matrix with the desired properties.

Since the matrix consists of integers, the function will treat the matrix as a numerical matrix and perform partial pivoting to maximize the size of the pivot.
