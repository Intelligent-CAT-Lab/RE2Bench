You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
