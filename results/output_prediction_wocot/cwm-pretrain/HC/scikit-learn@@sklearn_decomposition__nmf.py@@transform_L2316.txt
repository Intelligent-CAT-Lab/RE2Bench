The function `transform` is called with a 2D numpy array as input. The first step is to check if the estimator is fitted using `check_is_fitted`. Since the estimator has a `components_` attribute, it is considered fitted. Next, the input data `X` is validated using `validate_data`. The `X` is converted to a 2D numpy array of shape (6, 5) with dtype float64. The function `_solve_W` is then called to minimize the objective function w.r.t W. Since `transform_max_iter` is None, the default value of 200 is used. The initial value of W is a 2D numpy array of shape (6, 3) with all elements equal to 0.028. The l1 and l2 regularization terms are computed and the multiplicative update for W is performed for the specified number of iterations. The final value of W is returned as the output of the function.
