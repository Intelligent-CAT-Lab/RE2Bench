The `_convert_other` method is being called with the following parameters:
- `self`: An instance of `FITS_rec` with some attributes.
- `column`: A column object with attributes like `_name`, `_format`, etc.
- `field`: The field to be converted, which is the NumPy array `[2 4]`.
- `recformat`: The format of the field, which is `'i8'` (int64).

Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Line 305**: The method `_get_scale_factors` is called with the `column` object. This method returns a tuple of boolean values and some scale factors. Since the format of the column is `'K'` (which is not a string or boolean), `_str` and `_bool` will be `False`, and `_number` will be `True`. The `_scale` and `_zero` flags will also be `False` since there are no scale or zero values provided. The `dim` will be `None` since there is no dimension information.

2. **Lines 307-319**: The code checks if the format of the field is a 'P' format (variable-length array) or an 'X' format (bit-packed array). Since the format is not either of these, the code proceeds to the next block.

3. **Lines 321-323**: The code checks if the column is an ASCII column and has a 'P' format. Since the column is not an ASCII column, this condition is not met.

4. **Lines 325-327**: The code checks if the field is a number and has scale or zero factors. Since `_scale` and `_zero` are both `False`, this condition is not met.

5. **Lines 329-331**: The code checks if the field is a boolean and is in the `_converted` dictionary. Since the field is not a boolean, this condition is not met.

6. **Lines 333-335**: The code checks if the field is a string and is in the `_converted` dictionary. Since the field is not a string, this condition is not met.
