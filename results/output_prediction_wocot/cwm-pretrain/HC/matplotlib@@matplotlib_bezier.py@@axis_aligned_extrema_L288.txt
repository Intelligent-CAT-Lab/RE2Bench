The `axis_aligned_extrema` function calculates the axis-aligned extrema of a Bezier curve. The degree of the Bezier curve is 0 (since `_N` is 1), which means the curve has only one control point. For a curve of degree 0, there are no axis-aligned extrema to compute. Therefore, the function will return empty arrays for both dimensions and roots.
