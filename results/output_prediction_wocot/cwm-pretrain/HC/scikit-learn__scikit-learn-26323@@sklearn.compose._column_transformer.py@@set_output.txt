The function `set_output` is designed to set the output configuration for the transformer. It should handle the transformers in the `ColumnTransformer` and apply the specified output configuration recursively. The configuration is provided as an argument and should be applied to all applicable transformers.

Given the input, the function should iterate over the transformers and apply the output configuration. The configuration is stored in the `transformers` attribute, but in this case, it is `null`, indicating that no specific transformers are provided.

The remainder is set to `"drop"`, which means that no specific remainder handling is required. The `transform` argument in the keyword arguments is `"pandas"`, which indicates that the output should be in the form of a pandas DataFrame.
