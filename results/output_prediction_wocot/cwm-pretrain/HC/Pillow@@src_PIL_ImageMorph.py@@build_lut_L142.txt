The given Python code defines a class `LutBuilder` with a method `build_lut` that constructs a lookup table (LUT) based on a set of patterns. The method first initializes a default LUT using the `build_default_lut` function, which sets each entry in the LUT to 0 or 1 based on whether the corresponding binary bit is set (i.e., whether the position of the current pixel is set to 1 or 0).

The `build_lut` method then processes the patterns provided as input. For each pattern, it generates all possible permutations according to the options specified in the pattern. The options include rotations (4), mirror (M), and negation (N). The permutations are then compiled into regular expressions and used to match against the binary representation of indices in the LUT.

For each index, the method checks if any of the patterns match the corresponding binary string. If a match is found, the LUT value at that index is updated to either 0 or 1, depending on the pattern's result.

Given the input patterns and the default LUT initialization, the output will be a bytearray of length 512, where each element is 0 or 1. The specific values will depend on the patterns provided and how they modify the LUT entries.
