From the given input and the Python function for `predict`, we need to evaluate the decision function for each sample in `X` and then determine the class based on the decision function shape and break ties setting.

The key steps are:
1. Check if the estimator is fitted.
2. Call the `_decision_function` method to get the decision values.
3. If `decision_function_shape` is 'ovr' and there are more than 2 classes, use `_ovr_decision_function` to transform the decision values.
4. Determine the predicted class based on the transformed decision values.

Given the `decision_function_shape` is 'ovr' and the number of classes is greater than 2, the function will use `_ovr_decision_function` to determine the class.

Now, let's analyze the input data and apply the function.

You have been provided with a Python function that is expected to generate a calendar for a specified range of years, weeks, and days. Given this function and the input parameters for the years, months, weeks, and days, along with the current date, predict the output of the function. The output should be in a JSON format and represent a structured response containing the calendar data for the specified range.

To generate the output, you should follow these steps:

1. Analyze the input parameters to understand the range of years, months, weeks, and days to be included in the calendar.
2. Based on the input, determine the start and end dates for the calendar.
3. Generate the calendar data for the specified range, ensuring that the output is in the correct JSON format.

Follow these instructions and provide the predicted output in the specified format.
