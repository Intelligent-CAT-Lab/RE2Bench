The `transform` function of the `ColumnTransformer` class is being called with an input array `X` of shape (3, 2). The `ColumnTransformer` is configured with one transformer named "trans" that is applied to columns [0, 1], and the remainder columns are set to be dropped (remains empty since there are no other columns). 

The `transform` function performs the following steps:
1. Checks if any extra parameters are passed, which are not allowed since metadata routing is not enabled.
2. Validates if the estimator is fitted. Here, the estimator is already fitted as evidenced by the attributes present in `self`.
3. Checks the input `X` for consistency with the number of features expected during fitting.
4. Performs transformation on the input `X` using the configured transformer "trans".
5. Validates the output of the transformation.
6. Horizontally stacks the transformed outputs.

Since the transformer "trans" is configured to transform columns 0 and 1 of the input array `X`, it will apply to the entire array given as the input. The output will be the result of this transformation.

Given the nature of the `Trans()` transformer (which is a placeholder in this context), its transformation effect is assumed to be an identity or a direct mapping for simplicity. Thus, the output will be the same as the input array transformed by this operation.

The output will be the stacked transformed outputs. Given the input array is 2D and there is only one transformer applied to all columns, the output array will have the same shape as the input array but transformed by the "trans" transformer.

You are given a function `is_valid`, which, given the head of a linked list and a sequence of instructions, returns a boolean indicating whether each instruction is possible, and if so, executes it on the list. The instructions are as follows:
- Move the pointer to the previous node (if possible)
- Move the pointer to the next node (if possible)
- Delete the current node (if possible)
- Undo the previous instruction (if possible)
- Redo the previous instruction (if possible)
- Get the value of the node at the pointer's position (if possible)

The function `is_valid` is already implemented. You are not allowed to modify this function.

Your task is to implement a function `execute_instructions`, which takes the same parameters as `is_valid`, but instead of returning a boolean, it returns the final state of the linked list after executing all the instructions, and the values retrieved at the pointer's position during the process. The instructions are executed in order, and if an instruction is possible, it is executed. If an instruction is not possible, the function skips that instruction and continues with the next one.

The linked list is represented as a sequence of strings, where each string is the value of a node in the list. The head of the list is the first string in the sequence. The sequence may be empty if the list is empty.

The instructions are represented as a string, where each character represents an instruction. The instructions are as follows:
- 'P': Move the pointer to the previous node (if possible)
- 'N': Move the pointer to the next node (if possible)
- 'D': Delete the current node (if possible)
- 'U': Undo the previous instruction (if possible)
- 'R': Redo the previous instruction (if possible)
- 'G': Get the value of the node at the pointer's position (if possible)

The values retrieved at the pointer's position are represented as a list of strings. If an instruction is not 'G', or if it is not possible to execute 'G', the value is an empty string.

The final state of the linked list is represented as a list of strings, where each string is the value of a node in the list. The head of the list is the first string in the sequence.

Here are some examples to illustrate the format of the inputs and outputs:
- Input: 
    - head: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    - instructions: 'PNDD'
    - Output: [['b', 'c', 'd'], ['a']]
- Input: 
    - head: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    - instructions: 'DUPG'
    - Output: [['c', 'd'], ['a', 'b']]
- Input: 
    - head: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    - instructions: 'GGGG'
    - Output: [['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
- Input: 
    - head: []
    - instructions: 'GGG'
    - Output: [[], ['', '', '']]

Here is the already implemented function `is_valid`:
```python
def is_valid(head: List[str], instructions: str) -> bool:
    """Check if the instructions are valid and execute them on the linked list.

    Args:
        head (List[str]): The head of the linked list.

Below is a Python function named `delete_and_rearrange_strings` that takes a list of strings `s` and an integer `k`. The function performs the following steps:
1. It removes any string from the list `s` that has length strictly less than `k`.
2. It then calculates the sum of the lengths of the remaining strings in the list.
3. Finally, it rearranges the list of strings in `s` so that they are sorted based on their lengths in descending order.
4. The function returns the sum of the lengths and the rearranged list.

Here is the Python code for the function:
```python
def delete_and_rearrange_strings(s, k):
    # Step 1: Delete strings with length less than k
    remaining_strings = [string for string in s if len(string) >= k]

    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the lengths of the remaining strings
    total_length = sum(len(string) for string in remaining_strings)

    # Step 3: Rearrange the list of strings in descending order
    rearranged_strings = sorted(remaining_strings, key=len, reverse=True)

    # Step 4: Return the sum and the rearranged list
    return total_length, rearranged_strings
```

Now, consider the following input:
- List of strings: `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']`
- Integer: `5`

Given the following Python function:

```python
def extract_numbers(input_string):
    numbers = []
    current_number = ""
    for char in input_string:
        if char.isdigit():
            current_number += char
        else:
            if current_number:
                numbers.append(int(current_number))
                current_number = ""
    if current_number:
        numbers.append(int(current_number))
    return numbers

# Example usage:
input_string = "abc123def456"
numbers = extract_numbers(input_string)
print(numbers)
```

The function `extract_numbers` takes a string as input and returns a list of integers. The integers are extracted from the string by iterating over each character in the string. If a character is a digit, it is added to a string `current_number`. If a character is not a digit, the function checks if `current_number` is not empty. If it is not empty, it converts `current_number` to an integer and appends it to the list `numbers`. The function also checks if `current_number` is not empty after the loop ends. If it is not empty, it converts `current_number` to an integer and appends it to the list `numbers`. Finally, the function returns the list `numbers`.

Now, I want you to predict the output of the function for the following input string:
```python
input_string = "pqr678stu901"

- Convert the reversed string to lowercase
- Replace all occurrences of 'a' with 'z'

For example, if the input string is "Hello, World!", the operations would result in "dlrow ,olleh" (reversed string), "dlrow ,olleh" (converted to lowercase), and finally "dlrow ,zllzh" (replacing 'a' with 'z').
