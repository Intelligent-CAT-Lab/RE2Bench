The provided input indicates that the value of `self` is the expression "-2". When we call `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative` with `positive=True`, the function checks if the number is less than zero. Since `-2` is less than zero, the output should be `False`, as it is not considered positive. Therefore, the predicted output is `{"output": false}`.
