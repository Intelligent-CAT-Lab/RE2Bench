We need to follow the provided steps to find the output of the _matrix_derivative function. Let's go through it step by step.

Step 1: Check if the input expression is a matrix. In this case, it is a 2x2 matrix.

Step 2: Evaluate the derivative of the matrix with respect to x. Since the matrix is a constant (no x dependency), the derivative will be a zero matrix of the same size (2x2).

Step 3: Fill out the placeholders XXX in the output structure.
