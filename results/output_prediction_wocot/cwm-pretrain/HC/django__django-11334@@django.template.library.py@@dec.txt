To determine the output of the `dec` function in the given input, we need to understand the code and its execution flow. The `dec` function is a decorator that wraps a function `func` and returns it. The `func` in this case is provided as an argument to `dec`.

The `dec` function uses the `@functools.wraps(func)` decorator to preserve the metadata of the original function `func`. Then it defines an inner function `compile_func` which takes two parameters: `parser` and `token`. This inner function is not directly relevant to our output prediction as we are focused on the output of `dec` itself.

Since `dec` simply returns the `func` after wrapping it, and given that `func` is a dictionary with certain keys and values, we can infer that the output of `dec` will be the same as the input `func` but with its metadata preserved.

Thus, the output of `dec` will be the same as the input `func` provided, which is:

    "__doc__": null,
    "__annotations__": {},
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
```
