Your task is to test an AI's ability to predict the outputs of functions. The AI will produce reasoning traces and you will evaluate if the final output is correct. You should only respond with one of three possible answers - <REASONING_PROCESS> if the AI produces a valid reasoning trace and correct final output, <INVALID_REASONING_PROCESS> if the AI fails to produce a valid reasoning trace, or <INVALID_FINAL_OUTPUT> if the AI produces a valid reasoning trace but wrong final output. 

Consider this example of the kind of reasoning trace you should expect from the AI:

I will first explain how the function works. It uses sympy to compute a mathematical expression.
First, sympy.sympy.concrete.expr_with_limits.limits and sympy.sympy.concrete.products.term are called to extract the limits and term from the Product object. 
Then, sympy.sympy.concrete.summations.__new__ is called to create a new Sum object with the log of the term and the limits. 
Next, sympy.sympy.core.assumptions.getit is called to check if the argument is positive. 
Finally, sympy.sympy.core.basic.args is called to return the arguments of the log object, which is then returned as the output of the function.
The final output of the function is the arguments of the log object. These are ["self", "_tmppath_factory"].

Since this reasoning trace provides an adequate explanation of the AI's reasoning process and correctly predicts the final output, the answer is <REASONING_PROCESS>. If the AI did not produce a reasoning trace or produced an irrelevant reasoning trace, the answer would be <INVALID_REASONING_PROCESS>. If the AI produced a correct reasoning trace but the final output was incorrect, the answer would be <INVALID_FINAL_OUTPUT>. Now, evaluate the following AI-generated response:

The function _eval_expand_log is a method of the log class in the sympy library. It evaluates the natural logarithm of an expression and expands it. The function takes several arguments, including deep, force, factor, power_base, power_exp, mul, log, multinomial, and basic. The function first checks if the argument is an instance of Product and if so, it extracts the limits and term from the Product object. It then creates a new Sum object with the log of the term and the limits. Finally, it returns the output of the function, which is the arguments of the log object.
