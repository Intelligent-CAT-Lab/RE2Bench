The function truncate_number takes a float as input and returns the float value that remains after truncating the decimal part. In this case, the input number is 1.33. When we truncate the decimal part, the result will be 0.33. Therefore, the output of the function will be 0.33.

The function normalize_text takes a text and an optional parameter remove_punctuation. It first converts the text to lowercase and removes leading/trailing whitespace. Then it replaces any sequence of whitespace with a single space. If remove_punctuation is True, it removes all punctuation from the text. In this case, remove_punctuation is set to False, so punctuation will not be removed. The input text is "This is a text to test normalize function!", which after lowercasing and whitespace replacement will become "this is a text to test normalize function!". Since punctuation removal is disabled, no further changes will be made.
