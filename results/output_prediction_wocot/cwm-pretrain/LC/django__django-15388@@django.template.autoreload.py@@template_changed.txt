The function `template_changed` is called with arguments `sender=None` and `file_path="/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html"`. 

1. The first line checks if the suffix of the file path is `.py`. The file path ends with `.html`, so this condition evaluates to `False`. The function then proceeds to the next line.
2. The function iterates over the results of `get_template_directories()`. This function is called, and it starts processing template directories.
3. The code checks if any template directory is in the parents of the provided `file_path`. This means checking if the `file_path` is located within any of the template directories.
4. If a match is found, the function calls `reset_loaders()` and returns `True`.

Since `file_path` ends with `.html` and the directory `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates` is one of the directories returned by `get_template_directories()`, this will trigger the `reset_loaders()` function. The return value of `template_changed` is `True`.

Now, let's construct the output:

```
{
    "output": true
}
