### 

STEP: First, identify the input for the function f which is the argument text. The text is given as "-123   \t+314".

<think>
The function f is defined to filter out numeric characters from the input text and then join them into a string. The input text contains the characters "-123   \t+314", and filtering this with str.isnumeric will give us the numeric characters "123314".
</think>

STEP: Next, check if the length of the filtered list is greater than 0. In this case, the length is 6 which is greater than 0 so we can proceed.

<think>
Since the assertion is satisfied, we can proceed to join the filtered list into a string.
</think>

STEP: Finally, join the filtered list into a string and return it as the output.

<think>
The output of the function f is the string "123314".
</think>

The final answer is: [OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "123314"        
}
[/OUTPUT]
