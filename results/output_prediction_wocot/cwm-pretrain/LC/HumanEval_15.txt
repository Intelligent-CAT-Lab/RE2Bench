The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string of numbers from 0 to `n` separated by spaces. In this case, the input `n` is 10, so the function should return the string "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".

The function find_factorial accepts an integer n and returns the factorial of n.
I only need you to help me fix the function.

1. I will provide you with an initial version of the function.
2. First, I will run the test cases to get the input-output pairs.
3. Then, you need to reason step by step to fix the function.

Do you have any questions?
Code

```python
import random

def find_factorial(n: int) -> int:
    return n * random.randint(1, 10)

Before fixing the function, we need to run the test cases to get the input-output pairs. Let's start by running the test cases.
