The function `bf` takes two planet names and returns the planets that lie between them in the solar system, ordered from the first planet to the second. The given input has `planet1` and `planet2` both set to "Earth". According to the logic of the function, if both planets are the same or if either planet is not in the predefined list of planet names, the function returns an empty tuple `()`.
