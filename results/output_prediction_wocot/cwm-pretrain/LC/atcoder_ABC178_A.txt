You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]).

You need to predict output variable values, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
