<think>
The function `__eq__` is a method in the class `PolyRing` from the `sympy.polys.rings` module. It checks if two `PolyRing` instances are equal by comparing their attributes: `symbols`, `domain`, `ngens`, and `order`. 

In the given input:
- `self` is an empty dictionary, which might indicate that it does not represent a valid `PolyRing` object.
- `other` is the integer `1`, which is not an instance of `PolyRing`.

Since `isinstance(other, PolyRing)` returns `False` when `other` is an integer, the function will return `False`. This is because the comparison requires `other` to be an instance of `PolyRing` and to have the same attributes as `self`. Given that `self` is empty and `other` is an integer, the result of the comparison will be `False`.
