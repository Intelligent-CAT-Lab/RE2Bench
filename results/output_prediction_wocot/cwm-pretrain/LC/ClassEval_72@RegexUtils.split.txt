The function `split` is a method of the `RegexUtils` class, which takes a regex pattern and a text as input, and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the text using the pattern. The pattern provided is `\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b`, which matches sequences of three digits, followed by a hyphen, then three more digits, a hyphen, and finally four digits - this is essentially a phone number format (e.g., 123-456-7890). The text to be split contains three such sequences: "123-456-7890", "876-286-9876", and "987-762-9767", and additional text in between. The function should therefore return a list containing the text parts that are not part of these sequences, effectively splitting the text into parts that do not match the phone number pattern.
