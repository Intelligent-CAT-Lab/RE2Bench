To solve this problem, we need to understand what the `loads` function does. The `loads` function takes a string `s` and decodes it using the `TimestampSigner` class. The decoded string is then passed to the `unsign_object` method of the `TimestampSigner` class, which returns a JSON object.

The input string `s` is a base64 encoded string, which needs to be decoded first. Then the decoded string needs to be passed to the `unsign_object` method to get the JSON object.

The decoded string contains the JSON object in the format `{"a": "django"}`, so the expected output will be a JSON object with the key "a" and the value "django".
