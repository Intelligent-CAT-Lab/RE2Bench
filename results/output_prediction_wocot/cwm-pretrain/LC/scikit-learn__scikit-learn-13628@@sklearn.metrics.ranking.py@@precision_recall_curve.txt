Based on the function and input provided, I need to predict the output of the `precision_recall_curve` function. I will use the provided tags to structure my response.

I need to generate a plausible output for the `precision_recall_curve` function based on the given input. Since the actual function relies on several dependencies and transformations, I will attempt to deduce a reasonable output structure based on typical expected behavior. The function returns precision, recall, and threshold values as NumPy arrays.

I will now create a plausible output for the `precision_recall_curve` function, given the input structure. The output will include precision, recall, and thresholds arrays.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0],
        [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    ]
}
```
