The `VotingRegressor.predict` function averages the predictions from all the estimators in the `estimators_` list. Since the weights are `None`, the predictions are averaged equally. The `_predict` function collects the predictions from each estimator using `predict(X)`, and then `np.average` computes the average along axis 1.

Now, let us reason step-by-step about what the `VotingRegressor.predict` function is doing. 

1. **Function Parameters:**
   - `self`: This contains the `estimators_` and `_weights_not_none`. 
     - `estimators_`: A list of fitted estimator objects.
     - `_weights_not_none`: Computed weights that ignore `None` or dropped estimators (not relevant here since weights are not specified).
   - `X`: The input features for which predictions are to be made.

2. **Function Body:**
   - `check_is_fitted(self)`: This ensures that the estimator (`VotingRegressor`) has already been fitted (i.e., it has called `fit` method). This is crucial because we need the `estimators_` to be fitted for prediction.
   - `np.average(self._predict(X), axis=1, weights=self._weights_not_none)`: 
     - `self._predict(X)`: This calls the `_predict` method of the `VotingRegressor`, which iterates over each estimator in `estimators_`, computes predictions for `X`, and stacks them as a 2D array (`[est1_preds, est2_preds, ...]`).
     - `np.average(..., axis=1, weights=self._weights_not_none)`: Averages the predictions of all estimators column-wise (axis 1) using the weights specified. Since `self._weights_not_none` is `None`, it assumes equal weights.

3. **Predictions:**
   - The output will be an array where each element is the average of the predictions from all estimators for that feature. Since both `estimators_` are the same, their predictions will also be the same. Therefore, the average will be the same as each individual prediction.

4. **Input Data:**
   - The input `X` is a 2D array of shape `(442, 10)`, meaning there are 442 samples with 10 features each.

5. **Output:**
   - The output of the `VotingRegressor.predict` function will be a 1D array of length 442, where each value is the average of the predictions made by both estimators for each sample.

Given the structure of the code and the parameters provided, the final output of the `VotingRegressor.predict` function will be an array where each prediction is the average of the two individual predictions, which are identical since the estimators are the same.

Please provide the output in the requested format.

1. The `VotingRegressor` class is a type of regressor that makes predictions based on a list of estimators.
2. The `predict` method first checks if the `VotingRegressor` instance is fitted using `check_is_fitted(self)`.
3. The `_predict` method computes predictions for each estimator in `estimators_` and stacks them as a 2D array.
4. The `np.average` function averages the predictions along axis 1 (column-wise) using the weights specified. Since weights are `None`, it assumes equal weights.

2. It first checks if the estimator (VotingRegressor instance) is fitted using check_is_fitted(self).
3. The _predict method is called with the input X.
4. This _predict method iterates over each estimator in self.estimators_.
5. For each estimator, it calls the predict method with the input X.
6. The predictions from all estimators are collected as a 2D array using np.asarray.

Now explain the process step-by-step.

First, the predict method of the VotingRegressor class is called with the input X. This method performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the VotingRegressor instance is fitted using check_is_fitted(self).
2. Calls the _predict method with the input X to get predictions from all estimators.
3. The _predict method iterates over each estimator in self.estimators_ and calls the predict method on each one with the input X. The predictions are collected as a 2D array.
4. The np.average function is used to compute the average of the predictions from all estimators along axis 1 (column-wise). This results in a 1D array of averaged predictions for each sample.
5. The weights parameter is set to self._weights_not_none, which is None in this case, indicating equal weights for all estimators.
6. The final output is the 1D array of averaged predictions for each sample in X.

Given the step-by-step reasoning and the input data, the final output will be a 1D array where each element is the average prediction for each sample in X. The output will be of the same length as the number of samples in X (442 in this case).
Output:
