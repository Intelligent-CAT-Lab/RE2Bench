The function `dup_l1_norm` is called with arguments `f = [1, 2]` and `K = "ZZ"`. The function checks if `f` is empty, which it is not, so it proceeds to calculate the sum of absolute values of the coefficients in `f` using `K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))`.

First, `dup_abs(f, K)` is called, which returns the list `[1, 2]` because the absolute values of the coefficients are the same as the coefficients themselves.

Then, `K.sum([1, 2])` is called, which returns the sum of the list, `3`.

Therefore, the output of the function is `3`.

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
