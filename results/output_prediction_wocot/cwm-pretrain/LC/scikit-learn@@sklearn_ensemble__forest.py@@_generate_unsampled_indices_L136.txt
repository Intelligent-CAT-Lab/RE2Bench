The function `_generate_unsampled_indices` generates unsampled indices by first creating sample indices using `_generate_sample_indices` and then identifying which indices are not sampled. The `_generate_sample_indices` function uses `random_instance.randint` to generate random indices. Given the inputs, `n_samples` is 150 and `n_samples_bootstrap` is 150, meaning the number of samples and the number of samples for bootstrap are the same. Therefore, all indices will be sampled at least once.

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output.
