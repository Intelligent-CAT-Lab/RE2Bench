The code reads three integers k, n, and w as input. It calculates the sum of the first w positive integers multiplied by k. If the sum is less than or equal to n, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the sum and n.

For the given input {"input": "\"1 1 1\""}, k=1, n=1, and w=1.

The sum is calculated as:
sum = 1 * 1 = 1

Since the sum is equal to n, the output is 0.

I apologize for the error. I will reason through the problem again.

For the given input {"input": "\"1 1 1\""}, k=1, n=1, and w=1.

The sum is calculated as:
sum = 1 * 1 = 1

Since the sum is equal to n, the output is 0.

I will make sure to format the output correctly in the future.
