<think>
The code snippet takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, then removes the first and second characters from `b`, converts both to integers, multiplies them, and divides the result by 100. 
In the given input:
- `a` is "776013196293085"
- `b` is "2.60"

Processing `b`:
- Remove the first character: "2.60" becomes ".60"
- Remove the second character: ".60" becomes "60"

Now `a` is "776013196293085" and `b` is "60"

Converting to integers:
- `a` becomes 776013196293085
- `b` becomes 60

Multiplying and dividing:
- 776013196293085 * 60 = 46560791777585100
- 46560791777585100 / 100 = 465607917775851
</think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": 465607917775851
