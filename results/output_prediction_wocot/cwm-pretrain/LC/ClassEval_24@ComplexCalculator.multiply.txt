<think>
The multiply function takes two complex numbers c1 and c2 and returns their product. To calculate the product of two complex numbers, we use the formula:

(a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

Given the input complex numbers:
c1 = -1 - 2j
c2 = -3 - 4j

Using the formula, we can calculate the product:
real = (-1 * -3) - (-2 * -4) = 3 - 8 = -5
imaginary = (-1 * -4) + (-2 * -3) = 4 + 6 = 10

So, the product of the two complex numbers is -5 + 10j.
</think>
The predicted output is:
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "(-5+10j)"        
}
