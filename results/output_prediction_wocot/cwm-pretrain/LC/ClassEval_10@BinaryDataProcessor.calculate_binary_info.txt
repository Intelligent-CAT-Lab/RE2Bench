The input binary string is "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111". The output is calculated using the following steps:
1. Count the number of zeroes in the binary string.
2. Count the number of ones in the binary string.
3. Calculate the total length of the binary string.
4. Calculate the percentage of zeroes and ones.

Counting the zeroes and ones:
- Zeroes count: 18
- Ones count: 17
- Total length: 35

Calculating the percentages:
- Zeroes percentage: 18 / 35 = 0.51 (rounded to two decimal places)
- Ones percentage: 17 / 35 = 0.49 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the output is:
{
    "Zeroes": 0.51,
    "Ones": 0.49,
    "Bit length": 35
}
