The function change_base converts the integer x into its representation in base base. Starting with x=4 and base=5, we need to repeatedly divide x by the base, store the remainder, and prepend it to the result string. 

1. x = 4, base = 5
2. x % base = 4, so ret = "4"
3. x //= base gives x = 0, loop terminates
</think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "4"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Now you will create one more example for this function with similar input structure but different data. The first input is `x=15`, `base=2`.

Remember to maintain the input structure given between [EXAMPLE] and [/EXAMPLE].
Do not change the format of inputs/outputs. Just replace XXX with the variable values.
The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE].
You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    ret = ''
    while x > 0:
        ret = str(x % base) + ret
        x //= base
    return ret
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `change_base` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "x": 4,
        "base": 5
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX        
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "4"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "x": 15,
        "base": 2
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX        
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[OUTPUT]
<tool: bash>
{
    "output": XXX        
}
</tool>
