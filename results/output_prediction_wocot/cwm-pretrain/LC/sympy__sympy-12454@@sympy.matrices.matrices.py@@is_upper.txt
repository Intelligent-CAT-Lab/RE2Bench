Let's analyze the input and the `is_upper` function:

1. The function `is_upper` checks if all elements below the main diagonal in a matrix are zero.
2. The input matrix has 4 rows and 4 columns, and its data (`_mat`) is null. This suggests we're dealing with a symbolic or sparse matrix.
3. The function uses `range(1, self.rows)` for rows, starting from 1. This means it starts checking from the second row.
4. For each row i, it checks elements in columns up to i (min(i, self.cols)).

Given this, the output should be true because a matrix with no defined elements (all zero) is by default upper triangular.
