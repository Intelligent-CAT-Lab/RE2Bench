The function `f` counts the occurrences of the string formed by repeating the input `char` twice within the input `text`. It then returns the substring of `text` starting from the index equal to the count of such occurrences. 

Given:
- `text = "vzzv2sg"`
- `char = "z"`

We need to count how many times "zz" (i.e., `char * 2`) appears in the string "vzzv2sg".

```
{
    "output": "zzv2sg"
}
```
