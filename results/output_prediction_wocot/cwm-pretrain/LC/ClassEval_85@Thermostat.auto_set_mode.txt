I need to analyze the provided Python class for the auto_set_mode method and understand how it behaves based on the given inputs.


The auto_set_mode method sets the mode to 'heat' if current_temperature is less than target_temperature, otherwise it sets the mode to 'cool'.


Given the inputs:
- current_temperature is 25
- target_temperature is 25


Since current_temperature is not less than target_temperature, the mode will be set to 'cool'.


However, the initial mode is already 'cool', so no change will occur. The output will reflect the mode after execution.

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function.

You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output.

The CaesarCipher class implements a Caesar cipher, which shifts letters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. The encode method uses the shift value to transform plaintext into ciphertext.


Given the inputs:
- shift is 3
- plaintext is "Hello, World!"


The Caesar cipher will shift each letter in the plaintext by 3 positions. The punctuation will remain unchanged.


Based on the Caesar cipher implementation:
- H -> K
- e -> h
- l -> o
- l -> o
- o -> r
- , -> ,
-  (space) ->  (space)
- W -> Z
- o -> r
- r -> u
- l -> o
- d -> g
- ! -> !


Therefore, "Hello, World!" will be transformed to "Khoor, Zruog!"
