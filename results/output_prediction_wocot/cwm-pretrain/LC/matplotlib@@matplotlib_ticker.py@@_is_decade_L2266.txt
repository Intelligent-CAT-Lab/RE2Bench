The function _is_decade checks if a given number x is a decade, meaning that its logarithm base `base` is an integer. In this case, x is 1e-07, base is 10, and rtol is 1e-07. Since x is a positive number and not zero, it calculates lx as the logarithm of the absolute value of x divided by the logarithm of base. Then it checks if lx is close to its rounded value using np.isclose with a relative tolerance of rtol. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether x is a decade.
