The code takes an input string, sorts its characters, and checks if the first two characters are the same and the last two characters are the same, but the first and last characters are different. For the input "FFEE", after sorting it becomes "EEFF". Here, s[0] == s[1] (both 'E') and s[2] == s[3] (both 'F'), and s[0] != s[2] ('E' != 'F'). Therefore, the condition is met, and the output will be "Yes".

The code first iterates through the input string to count the occurrences of 'e' and 'o', as well as the number of '?' characters. It then checks if the sum of 'e' and 'o' is even. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits. If not, it checks if there are at least 3 'e's and 1 'o'. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "No". For the input "o?eooe?ee", the counts are 6 'e's, 2 'o's, and 2 '?'. The sum of 'e' and 'o' is 8, which is even, so the condition for printing "Yes" is met.

The code takes input for a grid with r rows and c columns. It initializes an empty set s. For each row, it reads in the values and for each column, if the value is 1, it adds the column index to the set s. If the value is 2, it removes the column index from the set s. After processing all rows, it prints the length of the set s. For the given input, the set s starts as empty. In the first row, columns 1 and 2 are added to s, making s = {1, 2}. In the second row, column 0 is removed, so s = {1, 2}. In the third row, column 0 is removed again (but it's not in s), column 1 is removed, making s = {2}, and column 3 is added, making s = {2, 3}. The length of s is 2.

The code takes an integer n as input, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It then checks for each pair of indices (i, j) if the difference in values a_i - a_j is equal to the absolute difference in indices |i-j|. If such a pair is found, it prints the 1-based indices and exits. If no such pair is found, it prints -1. For the input [4, 2, 1, 5], the code iterates through all pairs. The pair (3, 1) has a_i - a_j = 1 - 4 = -3 and |i-j| = 3 - 1 = 2, which are not equal. The pair (4, 1) has a_i - a_j = 5 - 4 = 1 and |i-j| = 4 - 1 = 3, which are not equal. The pair (2, 1) has a_i - a_j = 2 - 4 = -2 and |i-j| = 2 - 1 = 1, which are not equal. The pair (3, 2) has a_i - a_j = 1 - 2 = -1 and |i-j| = 3 - 2 = 1, which are not equal. The pair (4, 2) has a_i - a_j = 5 - 2 = 3 and |i-j| = 4 - 2 = 2, which are not equal. The pair (4, 3) has a_i - a_j = 5 - 1 = 4 and |i-j| = 4 - 3 = 1, which are not equal. Since no pair satisfies the condition, the code prints -1.
