<think>
The function `__lt__` compares the given Integer `self` with `other`. Both `self` and `other` are given as strings "3" and "1", which are successfully converted to Integer instances within the function using `_sympify`. Since `self.p` (p=3) is greater than `other.p` (p=1), the condition `_sympify(self.p < other.p)` evaluates to False. As a result, the function returns False.
