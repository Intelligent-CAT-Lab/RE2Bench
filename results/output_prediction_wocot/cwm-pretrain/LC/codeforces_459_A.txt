Let's break this down step by step. Here's what happens when we run the code with the input "3 4 7 8":

1. The input is split into four variables: anti, b, c, and d.
   anti = 3
   b = 4
   c = 7
   d = 8

2. Two variables are calculated:
   l = |3 - 7| = 4
   m = |4 - 8| = 4

3. Since anti != c, we skip the first condition.
4. Since b != d, we skip the second condition.
5. Now we check if l != m. Since 4 == 4, this condition is false.
6. Therefore, we execute the final else block:
   print(3, 8, 7, 4)

So the output will be:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "3 8 7 4"        
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
