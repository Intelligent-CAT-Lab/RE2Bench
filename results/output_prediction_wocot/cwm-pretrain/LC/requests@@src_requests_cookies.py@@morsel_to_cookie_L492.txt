You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.

<think>
The morsel_to_cookie function creates a cookie from an input morsel dictionary. Looking at the input provided:
- 'max-age' is an empty string, so the function will skip the first if statement.
- 'expires' is set to "woops", which is not None or a boolean value, so the function will attempt to parse it.
- The time.strptime call with the input "woops" will raise a ValueError because the input doesn't match the expected format.

Thus, the function will raise a ValueError from the call to calendar.timegm.
