To predict the output of the `get_n_splits` function, we need to analyze the code and determine what it does. The function takes in three parameters: `X`, `y`, and `groups`. It returns the value of `self.n_splits`, which is set in the `__init__` method of the `_BaseKFold` class.

The function does not use the input parameters `X`, `y`, or `groups` in any way, so we can ignore them for the purpose of predicting the output.

The `__init__` method of the `_BaseKFold` class sets `self.n_splits` to the value of the `n_splits` parameter passed to the function, which is set to 3 in the input.

Therefore, the output of the `get_n_splits` function will be the value of `self.n_splits`, which is 3.
