<think>
The provided code takes two integers as input, S and W, and checks if S is less than or equal to W. If it is, the output is "unsafe"; otherwise, the output is "safe".
The input is "74 74", which means S and W are both 74.
Since S is not less than or equal to W, the output should be "unsafe".

You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this piece of code, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. You need to predict output variable values, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
