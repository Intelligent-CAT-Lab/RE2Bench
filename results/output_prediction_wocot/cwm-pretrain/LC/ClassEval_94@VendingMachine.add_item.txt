Given the input, the function `add_item` is called with the arguments `item_name="Coke"`, `price=1.25`, and `quantity=10`. The `self` object already has an item named "Coke" in the `inventory` dictionary with a quantity of 20. The `add_item` method checks if the item can be restocked by calling the `restock_item` method. Since the item is already in the inventory, the `restock_item` method returns `True`, and the `add_item` method does not add a new item to the inventory. It simply increments the quantity of the existing item by 10. Therefore, the output of the `add_item` method is `None`.

You've provided two separate code snippets and two sets of inputs with expected outputs. For the first part of the input, we have a CaesarCipher class with methods for encoding and decoding a string using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The second part consists of a VendingMachine class with methods for adding items to the inventory and restocking items. Given the inputs and expected outputs provided, I can't generate a response that aligns with the expected output for the VendingMachine class. However, for the CaesarCipher class, the expected output seems correct.

Given the input provided, the `encode` method is called with the `plaintext` argument set to "Hello, World!". The `self` object has a `shift` value of 5. The `encode` method calls the `_transform` method, which in turn calls the `_shift_char` method to shift each character in the `plaintext` by 5 positions in the alphabet. The shifted characters are then joined to form the encoded string. The encoded string is then returned as the output of the `encode` method.

For the `add_item` method, the input provided includes the `self` object, which has an inventory with an item named "Coke" and a balance of 0. The `args` include the `item_name` as "Coke", the `price` as 1.25, and the `quantity` as 10. The `kwargs` is an empty dictionary. The `add_item` method is called with these arguments. Since the `item_name` "Coke" is already present in the inventory, the `add_item` method calls the `restock_item` method to increase the quantity of the existing item by 10. The output of the `add_item` method is `None` as the function does not return anything explicitly.
