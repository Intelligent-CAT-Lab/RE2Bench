</think> 
The input provided is a string "1 1000000000", which means a = 1 and b = 1000000000.

The first condition in the code checks if a <= 0 and 0 <= b, which is not true in this case.

The second condition checks if a < 0 and (b - a) % 2 == 0. Since a = 1, the first part of the condition (a < 0) is false.

Therefore, the code proceeds to the else block and prints "Positive".
