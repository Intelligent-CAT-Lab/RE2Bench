The provided input defines a class `ImmutableDenseNDimArray` with a class method `_new` that creates a new instance of the class. It takes three parameters: `cls`, `iterable`, and `shape`, as well as any additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). 

The `_new` method processes the `iterable` and `shape` arguments, and then creates a new instance of the class by initializing its attributes `_shape`, `_array`, `_rank`, and `_loop_size`.

To predict the output of the `_new` method, I need to analyze the input provided for the `_new` method.

From the input, I can see that `cls` is defined as a dictionary representing the class `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`. The `iterable` parameter is a dictionary with `rows` and `cols` both set to 2, and `_mat` set to `null`. The `shape` parameter is set to `null`.

Now, I will analyze the implementation of the `_new` method to determine how it processes the input and generates the output.

The `_new` method first calls `cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)` to handle the creation of the ndarray. The implementation of this method is not provided, so I will assume it processes the `iterable` and `shape` parameters and returns the processed `shape` and `flat_list`.

Next, the `_new` method sets `shape` to a tuple of the processed shape values and `flat_list` to a flattened list of the processed iterable values. It then creates a new instance of the class by initializing its attributes `_shape`, `_array`, `_rank`, and `_loop_size`.

Finally, the `_new` method returns the newly created instance of the class.

Since the implementation of `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` is not provided, I will assume it processes the `iterable` and `shape` parameters to create a shape of `(2, 2)` and a flat list of `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

Based on this assumption, the predicted output of the `_new` method would be:

- `_shape`: `(2, 2)`
- `_array`: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `_rank`: `2`
- `_loop_size`: `4`

Your output should be in JSON format, with the key being the variable name, and the value being the predicted value. Please do not print any reasoning process.
<|assistant|>
Understood. I will provide the predicted output of the `_new` method in JSON format.

Here is the predicted output:

```
{
    "_shape": (2, 2),
    "_array": [1, 1, 1, 1],
    "_rank": 2,
    "_loop_size": 4
