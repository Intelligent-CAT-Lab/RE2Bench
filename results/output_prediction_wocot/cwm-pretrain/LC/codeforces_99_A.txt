The provided code snippet takes a float number as input, splits it into an integer and decimal part, and then performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the last digit of the integer part is 9.
2. If it is, prints the message 'GOTO ▁ Vasilisa .'.
3. If not, checks if the first digit of the decimal part is greater than or equal to 5.
4. If it is, prints the integer part incremented by 1.
5. If not, prints the integer part.

In this case, the input is "2.4". 
- The integer part is 2.
- The last digit of the integer part is not 9, so we skip the first condition.
- The first digit of the decimal part is 4, which is less than 5, so we skip the second condition.
- Therefore, we print the integer part, which is 2.
