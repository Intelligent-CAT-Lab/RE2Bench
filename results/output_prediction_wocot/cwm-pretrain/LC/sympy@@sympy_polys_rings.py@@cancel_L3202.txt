To predict the output of the `cancel` method, we need to analyze the given input and understand the functionality of the method. The `cancel` method takes a `g` parameter, which is a polynomial element in the same ring as the polynomial `f`. The method then calculates the cofactors of `f` and `g` and returns the resultant polynomials.

Given the input:
- `self`: A polynomial element in the ring "Polynomial ring in x, y, z, w over ZZ with lex order".
- `g`: A polynomial element with coefficients and monomials defined as a dictionary.

The output of the `cancel` method is a tuple containing two polynomials: the first is `p`, and the second is `q`, where `p` and `q` are cofactors of `f` and `g`, respectively.

Based on the input and the functionality of the `cancel` method, the output should be a tuple containing two polynomial elements in the same ring as `self`.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": [
        {
            "(0, 0, 0, 0)": 1
        },
        {
            "(0, 0, 0, 0)": 1
        }
    ]
}
[/OUTPUT]

### Explanation:
- `p`: The first element of the output tuple is the polynomial `p`, which is the same as the input polynomial `g` because `f` and `g` are both constant polynomials with the coefficient 1.
- `q`: The second element of the output tuple is the polynomial `q`, which is also the same as the input polynomial `g` because the GCD of `f` and `g` is 1, and the cofactor of `g` with respect to the GCD is `g` itself.

Therefore, the output is a tuple containing two identical polynomial elements.
