First, the CaesarCipher class is created with an initial shift of 3. The normalize method replaces any Windows-style newline characters with Unix-style newlines. The _alpha_index method calculates the index of a character in the alphabet, ignoring case, and returns -1 for non-letter characters. The _shift_char method shifts a character by a given amount, wrapping around the alphabet. The _transform method applies a shift to each character in a text string. The encode method encodes a plaintext string using the shift value of the instance. The decode method decodes a ciphertext string using the inverse shift value of the instance.

In this specific input, a CaesarCipher object is created with a shift of 5, and the plaintext "Hello, World!" is encoded. Each character in the plaintext is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet, resulting in the encoded output "Mjqqt, Btwqi!".

The BookManagement class is created with an empty inventory. The add_book method adds a book to the inventory, updating the quantity if the book already exists. In this specific input, the inventory already contains 'book1' with a quantity of 2 and 'book2' with a quantity of 1. The method is called with the title 'book2', and since 'book2' already exists, its quantity is incremented by 1, resulting in 'book2' having a quantity of 2.
