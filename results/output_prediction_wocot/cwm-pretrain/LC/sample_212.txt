The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. It then enters a loop that runs for `len(nums) - 1` times, which means it will execute the loop body 6 times since the input list has 7 elements. In each iteration of the loop, the `reverse` method is called on `nums`, which reverses the list in place. 

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. The input list is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
2. In the first iteration, the list becomes `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`.
3. In the second iteration, the list becomes `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` again, as the list is reversed back to its original state.
4. This pattern continues, with the list alternating between its original state and its reversed state with each iteration.

After an even number of iterations (0, 2, 4, etc.), the list will be in its original state. After an odd number of iterations (1, 3, 5, etc.), the list will be in its reversed state.

Since the loop runs 6 times (an even number), the list will end up in its original state, which is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
