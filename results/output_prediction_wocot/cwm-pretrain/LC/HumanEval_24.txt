You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
import re
import string

def normalize_text(text, remove_punctuation=True):
    text = text.lower().strip()
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    if remove_punctuation:
        text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    return text
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `normalize_text` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "text": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
    }
}

What will be the output of `largest_divisor` given the following input:

Let's go through this step by step.

Given the function `largest_divisor`:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

The input to this function is `n = 3`. The goal of the function is to find the largest integer `i` (less than `n`) such that `n` is divisible by `i`. This means we are looking for the largest proper divisor of `n`.

### Reasoning:

1. `reversed(range(n))` creates a sequence of numbers from `n-1` down to `0`. When `n = 3`, `range(n)` is `[0, 1, 2]`, and `reversed(range(n))` gives the sequence `[2, 1, 0]`.

2. We now iterate over this sequence:
   - First, `i = 2`:
     - Check if `n % i == 0` (i.e., if `3 % 2 == 0`). This is `1`, so it is not zero. Move to the next `i`.
   - Next, `i = 1`:
     - Check if `3 % 1 == 0`. This is `0`, so the condition is satisfied.
     - The function returns `1`.

3. The loop terminates because the function returns `1`.

### Output:

The function returns `1`, because it is the largest integer less than `3` that divides `3` evenly.



[ANSWER]
assert largest_divisor(3) == 1
