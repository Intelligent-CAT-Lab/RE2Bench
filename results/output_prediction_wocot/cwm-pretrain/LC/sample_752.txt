To solve this problem, we need to understand what the function `f` is doing. The function takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `amount`. It returns a new string that is formed by concatenating `amount - len(s)` occurrences of the character 'z' to the beginning of the string `s`.

Given the input `s = "abc"` and `amount = 8`, we can see that the length of `s` is 3. Therefore, the number of 'z' characters to be added is `8 - 3 = 5`. The resulting string is "zzzzzabc".

Now use Python to get the output of `f` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "s": "abc",
        "amount": 8
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

}
[/INPUT]
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "zzzzzabc"
}
