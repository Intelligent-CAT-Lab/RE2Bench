The function __pow__ is called with n = -2. Since n is not an instance of Permutation, it is cast to an int. The array_form of the Permutation is null, which means it is not set. However, the size of the Permutation is 7. 

The function _af_pow is called with the array_form and n. Since array_form is null, it will be replaced with the size of the Permutation, which is 7. The _af_pow function is used to compute the power of a permutation. 

For n = -2, the inverse of the permutation is computed. The inverse of a permutation is obtained by replacing each element in the array with the index of its occurrence. For a permutation of size 7, the inverse of the permutation will have the same elements but in the reverse order. 

Therefore, the output will be a Permutation with _array_form [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and _size 7.

The output of the __pow__ function is not a Permutation object. The function _af_pow returns a list, not a Permutation object. Therefore, the output should be a list, not a Permutation object.
