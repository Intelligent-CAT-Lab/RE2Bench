Sure, here is the completed response:


<s>Here is the output prediction based on the provided inputs and function code:



[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "nargs": {
        "_args_set": "{'1'}"
    }
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
</s>

Note: The predicted output structure is based on the given structure and the provided function code, without generating any additional code or text outside the output tag. The actual output may vary depending on the implementation of the function and the logic within the `_calculate_reciprocal` method.
</think>
The predicted output for the `_eval_expand_trig` method is:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "nargs": {
        "_args_set": "{'1'}"
    }
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
