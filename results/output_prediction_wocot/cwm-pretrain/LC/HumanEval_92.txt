The function any_int checks if all three input parameters are integers and if any two of them sum up to the third. Given the inputs x = 2, y = 1, and z = 1, we need to check if any of the conditions (2 + 1 == 1, 2 + 1 == 1, or 1 + 1 == 2) are true.

Checking each condition:
- 2 + 1 == 1 is false
- 2 + 1 == 1 is false
- 1 + 1 == 2 is true
Since one of the conditions is true, the function should return True.

The function returns true because one of the conditions (1 + 1 == 2) is satisfied.
