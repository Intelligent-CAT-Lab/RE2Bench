The function interval_contains checks if a value lies within a given interval. The interval is provided as a string of an array containing two numbers. First, I will parse the input to extract the interval values and the val. Then, I will determine if the val is within the interval by comparing it against the sorted interval bounds.

First, I will extract the interval values by parsing the string representation of the array, which will give me the bounds of the interval. Then, I will sort these bounds to ensure the smaller value is the lower bound and the larger value is the upper bound. Finally, I will compare the val to these bounds to determine if it lies within the interval.
