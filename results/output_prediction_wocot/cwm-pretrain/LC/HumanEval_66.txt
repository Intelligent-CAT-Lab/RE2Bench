The function `digitSum` takes a string `s` and calculates the sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string.

Given the input string "You arE Very Smart", we need to iterate over each character, check if it's uppercase, and if so, add its ASCII value to the sum.

Here are the steps:
1. "Y" is uppercase, its ASCII value is 89.
2. "o" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
3. "u" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
4. " " (space) is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
5. "a" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
6. "r" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
7. "E" is uppercase, its ASCII value is 69.
8. " " (space) is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
9. "V" is uppercase, its ASCII value is 86.
10. "e" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
11. "r" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
12. "y" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
13. " " (space) is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
14. "S" is uppercase, its ASCII value is 83.
15. "m" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
16. "a" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
17. "r" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.
18. "t" is not uppercase, its ASCII value is 0.

Summing up all the ASCII values: 89 + 69 + 86 + 83 = 327.
