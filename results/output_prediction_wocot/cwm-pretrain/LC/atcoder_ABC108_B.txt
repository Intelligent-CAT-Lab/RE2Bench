To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the code and the provided input.

The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. It then calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and the difference between `y2` and `y1`, assigning these values to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Finally, the code prints the values of `x2 - b`, `y2 + a`, `x1 - b`, and `y1 + a`.

Given the input:
```
{
    "input": "\"100 100 100 99\""
}
```
We can break down the calculations as follows:
- `x1` = 100, `y1` = 100, `x2` = 100, `y2` = 99
- `a` = `x2 - x1` = 100 - 100 = 0
- `b` = `y2 - y1` = 99 - 100 = -1
- The final output is calculated as:
  - `x2 - b` = 100 - (-1) = 101
  - `y2 + a` = 99 + 0 = 99
  - `x1 - b` = 100 - (-1) = 101
  - `y1 + a` = 100 + 0 = 100

Therefore, the final output of the code snippet is:
```
101 99 101 100
```
And in the required format:
```
{
    "output": "101 99 101 100"
}
```

Given the Python code snippet and the provided input, let's analyze the code step by step.

The code takes four integers from the input string separated by spaces, assigns them to variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, then calculates `a` as the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and `b` as the difference between `y2` and `y1`.

The final step prints the values of `x2 - b`, `y2 + a`, `x1 - b`, and `y1 + a`.

Given the input:
```
{
    "input": "\"100 100 100 99\""
}
```
We can extract the integers `100`, `100`, `100`, and `99` for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, respectively.

Now, let's calculate `a` and `b`:
- `a` = `x2 - x1` = `100 - 100` = `0`
- `b` = `y2 - y1` = `99 - 100` = `-1`

Finally, we can calculate and print the values:
- `x2 - b` = `100 - (-1)` = `101`
- `y2 + a` = `99 + 0` = `99`
- `x1 - b` = `100 - (-1)` = `101`
- `y1 + a` = `100 + 0` = `100`

Therefore, the predicted output is:
```
101 99 101 100
```
And in the required JSON format:
```
{
    "output": "101 99 101 100"        
}
```

Given the Python code snippet:

a = x2 - x1
b = y2 - y1
print(x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a)
```
And the input:
```json
{
    "input": "\"100 100 100 99\""

```
We can break down the execution as follows:

1. The input string `"100 100 100 99"` is split into four integers: `x1 = 100`, `y1 = 100`, `x2 = 100`, `y2 = 99`.
2. Calculate `a = x2 - x1 = 100 - 100 = 0`.
3. Calculate `b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1`.
4. Print the values of `x2 - b`, `y2 + a`, `x1 - b`, and `y1 + a`, which are:
   - `x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99`
   - `x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100`

Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be:
```
101 99 101 100
```

    "output": "101 99 101 100"
