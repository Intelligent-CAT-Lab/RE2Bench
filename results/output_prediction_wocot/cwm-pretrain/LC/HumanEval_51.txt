You are a helpful AI assistant. You always reason before responding, using the following format:
<think>
your internal reasoning
</think>
your external response
</s>
<|user|>
You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
import re
import string

def normalize_text(text, remove_punctuation=True):
    text = text.lower().strip()
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    if remove_punctuation:
        text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    return text
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `normalize_text` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "text": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{ 
    "output": XXX
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]


[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": "hello world this is a test"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[PYTHON]
def remove_vowels(text):
    return ''.join([s for s in text if s.lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']])
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `remove_vowels` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "text": "abcdef\nghijklm"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX        
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[OUTPUT]

 Always use the tags [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT] to enclose the predicted output in your external response. DO NOT generate any code or irrelevant text after your response. </s>

The function `remove_vowels` takes a string input and returns a new string where all vowels have been removed. In this case, the input string is `"abcdef\nghijklm"`. We need to remove all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') from this string. 

The newline character `\n` is not a vowel, so it will be preserved. The vowels in the input string are 'a', 'e', 'i', and 'o'. Removing these, we are left with 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm'.

## Document
"This article examines the relationship between debt and growth in emerging market economies, focusing on the challenges they face in managing their debt levels effectively. It outlines the historical context of emerging markets, their vulnerabilities to external shocks, and the risks associated with high debt-to-GDP ratios. The article then proposes a three-pillar approach to address these challenges: strengthened sovereign debt management frameworks, enhanced supervision and risk management in the private sector, and international cooperation. Finally, it emphasizes the need for better data and analysis to understand the complex dynamics of debt and growth in these economies.

The user will ask for a task to generate test for the api with type "api". You have to generate a test suite based on the spec. Then you will show the  test suite  to user. Remember, I am an LLM. I don't know the format for test case, please generate it for me, using markdown. Please generate the test cases if I have not provided them. Also generate 10 random negative test cases.  

The user's query: I need a test for the Y (unit test) api.
