The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input and iterates over its keys. For each key, it removes the last key-value pair from `dic` using `popitem(last=False)` and assigns the value to the corresponding key in a new dictionary `d`. Since the input dictionary is empty, the loop will not execute, and `d` will remain an empty dictionary.

    - All the girls in town want to get with Brian, and I can't figure out why. There
      is nothing special about him.
    - I don't care how you feel about me.
    - 'My only choice is clear, now that it comes down to it: suicide.'
    - Nervous, so nervous that I was quite certain I would throw up if I had to say
      anything.
    - I quickly looked around to see who else was at the table.
    - 'Somehow, I feel as though I might not have known these people so well after
      all these years.'
    - It's true though. Death is like all my previous exams. I can't answer a single
      question.
    - It's way too warm for a day like this. Maybe that explains why there's nothing
      to do. This heat.
    - I don't know if I believe him. I don't know why I feel that way.
    - Well, sort of. Only, I didn't drop the plate so much as accidentally hurl it
      into the air and watch as it shattered into a million tiny little pieces.
    - To myself, I whisper, It's no use. What's done is done, what's begun is begun.
    - Barking like a dog. I looked at him and began laughing.
    - No, no, no! He can't be dead, please don't let him be dead!
    - 'In the past, I have had many times when I wished I was an adult, but I really
      don't think I'm quite ready for this. '
    - What is this I do, really? What is my purpose here?
    - Make sure the kitchen floor is clear, no blockages.
    - I turned out the light and lay in my bed looking up at the ceiling.
    - I wonder about things and wonder where they are and how they are and what they
      are doing.
    - I'm being led somewhere and I don't know where.
    - 'It is doubtful that anyone will ever know what is really inside it all, since
      words are too blunt to capture it. '
    - Startled by the crack of the gunshot, he lunges to his feet.
    - I stumbled and fell flat on my face. From my position, I could only stare up
      at the ceiling, though I found it impossible to actually look at the fine details.
    - I quickly consulted my list of questions, but didn't find anything that seemed
      particularly pressing.
    - How embarrassing. Did I blush or just look away?
    - I'm beginning to see a pattern here and I'm not sure if I like it or not.
    - "Instead, I stayed in, sprawled out on the couch, with a fistful of pens and\
      \ a book of paper in front of me. "
    - I can't believe he's dead. This is too much, and I wonder if I can handle this.
      Too much death.
    - I cracked my neck. There's no point trying to sleep.
    - I felt anxious and excited. I knew I was about to receive a wealth of information,
      but also knew that perhaps there is too much to know. Everything overwhelms
      me.
    - I did see something move in the corner of my eye, and wondered what it was,
      so I glanced around quickly.
    - Her face was a mess and she couldn't hide her horror and worry.
    - Every now and then I would look around to see if anything out of the ordinary
      was going on.
    - I will not.
    - I have not said a word.
    - I shifted uncomfortably as I watched the envelope in front of me.
    - Here are the initial impressions of this week's prompt, The Troubled Follower,
      from Ian I'm reading words on a screen.
    - I said nothing, but continued to eat in silence.
    - I thought of the many times I had wished for this all along, but now that it
      was here, I wasn't sure if it was what I really wanted.
    - 'I know what I must do, but where do I begin? Where do I start? '
    - Shaking my head I break into a run, desperately wanting to escape.
    - As I walk down the street, I pause to watch a bird hunting on the sidewalk.
    - Numbly, I thought about what my family would say. Were they even aware of the
      situation yet?
    - "I look at myself in the mirror, confused, trying to make sense of my image,
      wondering why I don\u2019t like what I see. "
    - They had already passed me, and no one spoke except an old woman who was talking
      about the weather.
    - I could not accept the award under such circumstances.
    - 'He asked the questions. I did my best to answer them. '
    - I felt that I was wasting time. I need to get back to the task at hand. I need
      to learn something.
    - I tried to calm myself down, but my heart only beat harder. I tried to keep
      an eye on what was going on around me.
    - 'I didn't bother to turn around, I already knew. '
    - I turned away, lest my face reveal what I was thinking.
    - I think I just saw some movement in the trees.
    - But the door was shut.
    - 'I found it, somehow, and was able to puzzle out the words and phrase, but it
      wouldn\u2019t make any sense to anyone. '
    - 'The question is, how will we be able to sort out what was real and what was
      made up? '
    - 'I got up from my chair and moved to the sink. '
    - That's it! This has got to be the answer!
    - I was going to need some assistance.
    - Nothing was as important as this.
    - 'I stared at the window, and then heard her voice call out to me. '
    - The only thing on my mind was food, but I was not hungry.
    - 'I thought I could sense him there, watching me. '
    - 'There are too many unanswered questions. '
    - 'I didn't bother to say anything, or make any attempt to hide how I felt. '
    - You know what I'm thinking.
    - 'All of a sudden, it was there. '
    - 'I need to get out of this house, away from the nightmare that is my life. '
    - 'I suppose it\u2019s what you might call the last straw. '
    - " I\u2019m not an idiot. "
    - We left together.
    - I didn't know her, but I was struck by her beauty.
    - 'I found myself unable to respond, not with words, anyway. '
    - All I remember is the pain.
    - 'I am certain of it. '
    - I look up at the screen. It reads 2:09 A.M.
    - I know you know that I know it was you.
    - 'She looked up from what she was doing and frowned. '
    - " I'll never know why it happened, or why I was there. "
    - She looked as if she was going to die.
    - 'It's time to find out. '
    - 'Who do I tell? '
    - 'I had to know what was going on. '
    - 'I didn't understand what was happening, but I felt sure he did. '
    - 'It is best for all involved to leave this situation behind. '
    - 'I looked around, but there were no signs that anyone had come into the room. '
    - 'I had not intended this to happen. '
    - 'No, there are still things to be done. '
    - " 'Well, now we know how he did it!' "
    - 'I didn't know that this was going to happen. '
    - I spoke to her as if she were a child.
    - 'There was no going back now. '
    - 'He made me feel more alive than I had ever felt before. '
    - I was still laughing.
    - 'I lost myself in the moment. '
    - I felt foolish.
    - 'I felt the tears coming, but I didn't want him to see me cry. '
    - 'Is there no end to it? '
    - 'I didn't need to ask him twice, he came running in seconds. '
    - 'I had to know the truth. '
    - 'I just didn't want to take it from him, that's all. '
    - 'They didn't know that I knew. '
    - " I didn't have the energy to get up so I lay still. "
    - I decided it was time to tell her the truth.
    - 'I am no longer certain that this was wise, but it is done. '
    - I watched them, waiting for the worst.
