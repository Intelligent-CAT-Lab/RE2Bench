The function `_coeff_isneg` takes a sympy expression `a` as input and checks if the coefficient of the expression is negative. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The function first checks if `a` is a `MatMul` (matrix multiplication) expression. If it is, it takes the first argument of `a` (which is the left-hand side of the matrix multiplication).
2. Then, it checks if `a` is a `Mul` (multiplication) expression. If it is, it takes the first argument of `a` (which is the first factor in the multiplication).
3. Finally, it checks if the resulting expression `a` is a `Number` (sympy's number class) and if it is an extended negative number (a number with a negative sign). 

The given input is the expression `cos(2*phi)/2`. The function will check if the first term (`cos(2*phi)`) is a negative number, which it is not. Therefore, the output will be `False`.
