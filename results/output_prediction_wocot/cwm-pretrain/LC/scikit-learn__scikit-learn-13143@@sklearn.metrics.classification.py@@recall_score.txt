I need to predict the output of `recall_score`. Based on the functions called during the execution, I can see that `recall_score` calls `precision_recall_fscore_support`, which calls several other functions such as `_check_targets`, `check_consistent_length`, `_num_samples`, `type_of_target`, `unique_labels`, `_unique_multiclass`, `multilabel_confusion_matrix`, `_prf_divide`, and `count_nonzero`.

Given the inputs, I see that both `y_true` and `y_pred` are `null`. This means that the input arrays are empty. 

In this case, the `precision_recall_fscore_support` function will be called with empty arrays. Since the arrays are empty, the `unique_labels` function will return an empty array, and the `multilabel_confusion_matrix` function will return an empty matrix.

The `precision_recall_fscore_support` function will then compute the precision, recall, and f-score, which will all be empty arrays. 

Finally, the `recall_score` function will return the recall, which will be an empty array.
