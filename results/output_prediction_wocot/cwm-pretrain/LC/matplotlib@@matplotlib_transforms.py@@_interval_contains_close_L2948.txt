1. The `_interval_contains_close` function checks if a value `val` lies within a given interval `[a, b]`, with a tolerance `rtol`.
2. The interval is specified as `"array([0.001, 1.   ])"`, which represents the interval `[0.001, 1]`.
3. The value `val` is given as `"array(0.2)"`, which is the value 0.2.
4. The `rtol` is set to `1e-10`, a very small number indicating a strict tolerance.

To determine the output:
- Extract `a` and `b` from the interval: `a = 0.001` and `b = 1`.
- Since `a < b`, no swapping is needed.
- Compute the tolerance range: `rtol = (b - a) * rtol = (1 - 0.001) * 1e-10 = 9.99e-11`.
- Check if `0.2` is within `[0.001 - 9.99e-11, 1 + 9.99e-11]`.

The value 0.2 is clearly within this interval, so the function should return `True`.
