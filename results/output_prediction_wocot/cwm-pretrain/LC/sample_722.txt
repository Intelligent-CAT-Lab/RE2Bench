You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
import re
import string

def normalize_text(text, remove_punctuation=True):
    text = text.lower().strip()
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    if remove_punctuation:
        text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    return text
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `normalize_text` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "text": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{ 
    "output": XXX
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]


[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": "hello world this is a test"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[PYTHON]
def f(text):
    out = ''
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i].isupper():
            out += text[i].lower()
        else:
            out += text[i].upper()
    return out
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `f` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "text": ",wPzPppdl/"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX        
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[OUTPUT]

 Always use the tags [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT] to enclose the predicted output in your external response. DO NOT generate any code or irrelevant text after your response. </s>
