Let's understand the function is_equal_to_sum_even. It checks if a number is even and greater than or equal to 8.

Given the input n = 10, we need to check if it satisfies the conditions:
1. Is 10 even? Yes, 10 % 2 = 0.
2. Is 10 greater than or equal to 8? Yes, 10 >= 8.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the function should return True.

The structure for the output is {"output": XXX}, so we need to fill in XXX with the result.

The expected output is {"output": true}.

        "Compressing and enlarging of facial features during facial expression is a crucial property for various face analysis problems. However, convolutions and traditional activation functions such as ReLU are not effective to capture these characteristics of facial features for understanding deep facial representations. To handle this issue, we present deep Manhattan rectified network (DMRN) which uses a new activation function with Manhattan distance and a depthwise separable convolution structure. Our experiments prove that DMRN achieves the state-of-the-art results on two challenging face analysis tasks: face recognition and facial expression recognition, while significantly reducing the memory and computation costs of DMRN with fewer parameters and less size than current CNN models. Furthermore, we perform ablation analysis to validate the effectiveness of DMRN's components.",

    "abstract": [
        "Advances in image processing have empowered editors to create images with unprecedented control and editability, including the ability to relocate objects across images. The plausibility of an image edit may be assessed based on the co-saliency between the moved object and the contextual background. This co-saliency is conditioned on the image contents and, thus, it should reflect the joint-distribution of background image features and appearance of the object. We use a co-saliency model to learn the joint distribution. We assume that co-saliency is defined by using the feature representation learned by a deep convolutional neural network, and our co-saliency model is given by the neighborhood component analysis (NCA) framework. In addition, we show that the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution fits the softmax values of a deep network, and we propose the use of the GEV distribution in the definition of our loss function. To evaluate the plausibility of a given image edit, the pixels of the edited image are used as input to the trained co-saliency model. Our results demonstrate that our co-saliency approach generalizes well across image datasets and that our approach is effective for estimating plausibility of edits.",

        "We revisit a classical issue of the information content for expression recognition from facial images. We have tested a variety of expressions and the underlying states of facial actions (action units) in the presence of two types of cropping: use of an outer (for images) crop and of a dense inner (for features) crop. We show that expression recognition does not benefit from the use of the outer crop, and can be enhanced by the use of the inner crop. Further, we show that not all expression states (action units) are contributing to recognition, and that the total number of information-bearing units is substantially smaller than the number of all units, which are redundantly activated.",

    "abstract": [
        "The striatum has been involved in many different cognitive functions and psychological states, but its fundamental neural computations are still debated. We use calcium imaging in mice to simultaneously study neural activity in the entire striatum and behaviour. We found a previously-unreported direct link between striatal neurons projecting to the globus pallidus (D1), where firing rates covary with attention, and neurons projecting to the substantia nigra (D2), where firing rates covary with memory. No other combination of neurons can account for the data equally well, and this link is independent of the mice's motivation and locomotion. Our findings suggest that the striatum, along with the neocortex, can perform a complex computation that involves both spatial and temporal variables, that might then be reduced to simpler variables in the downstream basal ganglia. These findings have implications for the wider basal ganglia, which might be capable of similarly complex computation.",

We first discuss the framework for learning in SNNs and present a proof of the supervised spiking network learning (SSL) theorem that establishes the expressiveness of such SNNs and the universality of the gradient descent learning rules used in the network. We then summarize some applications where SSL has been applied in the context of neuroscience. In particular, we consider two applications where SSL-trained SNNs reproduce key behaviors in central pattern generators (CPGs), both in terms of their responses to perturbations and their spatiotemporal dynamics. More generally, we review the use of SSL in artificial networks and demonstrate how timing-based coding can yield parsimonious internal representations and, in many cases, enables high energy-efficiency. Since SNNs present unique challenges for processing, we consider various approaches for scalable training of large SNNs. Finally, we consider how the predictive power of SSL allows us to perform hypothesis testing and establish a link with network minimization.",

        "The brain is known to process visual information in a hierarchical manner. How this hierarchical processing is reflected in the spiking activity of individual neurons is not known. Here we report the results of a deep computational learning study where spiking neurons are trained to make increasingly complex categorization decisions over time as in the hierarchical processing in the cortex. The spiking neurons are trained by gradient descent over a novel likelihood function. When trained to recognize multiple higher-order category types, the spiking neurons often exhibit subthreshold waves and complex spatiotemporal activity patterns. We then evaluate the coding in the neurons by quantifying the information content of their spikes and the input spikes. We show that spiking neurons exhibit more efficient coding than non-spiking units and a significant fraction of the information is represented by both the input spikes and the spatiotemporal activity patterns exhibited by subthreshold waves. These results indicate that both spikes and membrane potential waves, including subthreshold waves, have important computational roles.",

We first construct a high-resolution anatomical map using an unbiased segmentation approach. This map resolves, in three dimensions, the 166 brain regions included in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas at a scale that represents the three-dimensional locations of 10431 voxels. Next, for each region we compute its diffusion fingerprint based on its total connection strength to every other region. Unlike previous work using simpler graph metrics, we find that regions differ considerably in their connection strength across their different areas, emphasizing the importance of using region-specific connectivity estimates. Furthermore, we show that two key features of the connectivity landscape -- global and regional, depending on cortical depth -- are retained when connections are weighted by strength rather than presence or absence. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of connectivity fingerprints in inferring relationships among regions.",

        "Hypertension is one of the most widely prevalent yet underdiagnosed chronic conditions in the world. It remains an important determinant of health and mortality rates around the globe. While diagnosis and management of hypertension can be achieved with personal blood pressure monitoring devices, the prevalence and often systemic nature of this condition makes it a good candidate for widespread continuous monitoring with smartphone technology. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model for using mobile phones to detect and track arterial compliance and pulse pressure propagation velocity from the continuous photoplethysmogram signal and convert these parameters to arterial blood pressure estimates, with or without the use of signal-embedded arterial compliance and pulse pressure propagation velocity. We evaluate this method on a dataset of 60 minute signal segments collected from five subjects. To our knowledge, this represents the first instance of the detection of arterial compliance and pulse pressure propagation velocity using a mobile phone, and the conversion of these physiological signals to arterial blood pressure.",

    "abstract": [
        "The purpose of this work was to develop and test Bayesian classification models for diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) and M. bovis from respiratory samples, with a special focus on distinguishing both species from non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Bayesian modeling yields a calibrated posterior probability of belonging to M. tuberculosis, and can thereby accommodate and address the uncertainty that is intrinsic to any diagnostic laboratory procedure. Using data obtained from 2741 patients, 369 of which had a final diagnosis of M. tuberculosis, we trained Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) and support vector machine (BSVM) classifiers using a multi-level dataset obtained by performing whole genome sequencing (WGS) on cultured isolates. BLR classifier had 98.8% sensitivity, 97.4% specificity for discriminating M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, 98.5% sensitivity, 97.2% specificity for discriminating M. tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and 95.3% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity for discriminating M. bovis and NTM. BSVM classifier had 98.6% sensitivity, 96.3% specificity for discriminating M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, 98.3% sensitivity, 98.0% specificity for discriminating M. tuberculosis and NTM and 95.9% sensitivity, 96.8% specificity for discriminating M. bovis and NTM. In conclusion, Bayesian machine learning classifiers may represent a useful addition to the diagnostic armamentarium, and may help resolve uncertainty when different classification techniques yield discordant results.",

    "abstract": [
        "Soil surveys have traditionally been performed through the collection of soil samples followed by laboratory analysis. These approaches require extensive human resources and financial investments and can take months or years to complete. With more than 1.8 billion hectares of US soils, it is impractical for soil surveys to be updated at a suitable frequency to guide current and future agricultural, regulatory and management practices. Machine learning algorithms offer an exciting opportunity to map soil properties with improved efficiency, speed and at higher spatial resolutions. However, many machine learning algorithms suffer from substantial limitations: 1) they require all samples to have the same resolution; 2) they rely on the hyperplane hypothesis for function estimation; 3) they often only estimate soil properties using the highest matching predictive attributes, which may not be the best approach for global-scale predictions of soil properties; 4) they require the exclusion of missing data. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning pipeline that uses the TensorFlow™ Learning API (TF-L), in which each major step is accomplished by a designated TF-L solver algorithm. The TF-L Pipeline offers several advantages compared to other machine learning pipelines: 1) it offers a systematic, extensible, and maintainable approach to training, evaluation, and deployment of models; 2) it accommodates attributes at different spatial resolutions; 3) it uses feed-forward, deep multi-layered networks to estimate complex functions; 4) it systematically evaluates a large number of training data when the algorithm encounters missing data. We applied the TF-L Pipeline to predict soil properties using data from the Northern Great Plains LTER site and made the resulting model available as a web service. To evaluate the performance of the TF-L model, the accuracy of predictions were compared to predictions from four additional TF-L models and with four machine learning algorithms: multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NN), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and quantile regression trees (QRT). In all cases, TF-L models were found to have the highest accuracy or error compared to other models. Finally, we used the TF-L model to predict soil properties from terrain attributes in the contiguous United States. The TF-L model accurately predicted depth to the water table with a coefficient of determination of 0.94. Thus, TF-L models present exciting opportunities to estimate soil properties at continental scales with unprecedented accuracy and at reasonable computational costs.",

We train a network of such neurons on a dataset of 400-dimensional inputs that are conditionally independent given the class.

    "abstract": [
        "One approach to imitation learning of goal-oriented tasks is TDT or trajectory-based differential training. TDT guarantees exact imitation and can be applied even if the number of actions is infinite. However, TDT suffers from several disadvantages, most notably that the agent is not required to stay safe or not diverge from the learned trajectory in any way. TDT is therefore not suited to imitating agents exhibiting low-to-mid levels of agency. In this paper, we introduce Corrigible and Deontic TDT Imitation Learning, two new algorithms that modify TDT to imitate behaviors that are corrigible, that is, able to recognize when a proposed trajectory violates safety constraints (such as driving into traffic) and correct it. We show that our algorithms are correct and robust in theory. Empirically, we apply both algorithms to two well-known TDT benchmarks and
