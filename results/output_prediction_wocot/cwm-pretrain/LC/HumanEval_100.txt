The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list where each element is calculated as `n + 2 * i` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Given `n = 3`, the range of `i` will be `0, 1, 2`.

- For `i = 0`: `3 + 2 * 0 = 3`
- For `i = 1`: `3 + 2 * 1 = 5`
- For `i = 2`: `3 + 2 * 2 = 7`

So the output list will be `[3, 5, 7]`.

The function `pairwise_average` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the average of consecutive elements in the input list.

Given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will calculate the average of each pair of consecutive numbers:
- The average of `1` and `2` is `(1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5`
- The average of `2` and `3` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`
- The average of `3` and `4` is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`
- The average of `4` and `5` is `(4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`

Therefore, the output list will be `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]`.

The function `is_even` checks if the input number is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even, otherwise it is odd.

Given the input `5`, the calculation is `5 % 2 = 1`. Since `1` is not equal to `0`, the function returns `False`.

The function `apply_function_to_list` takes two arguments: a function `func` and a list `items`. It applies the function `func` to each element of the list `items` and returns a new list containing the results.

Given the input:
- `func`: A lambda function that returns `None` (based on the provided function reference).
- `items`: `[1, 2, 3]`

The lambda function, as defined by `<function <lambda> at 0x7f57a9f27df0>`, appears to return `None` for each input value. Therefore, applying this function to each element in `[1, 2, 3]` will result in a list `[None, None, None]`.
