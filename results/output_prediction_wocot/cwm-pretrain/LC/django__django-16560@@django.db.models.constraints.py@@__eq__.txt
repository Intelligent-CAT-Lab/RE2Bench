This code defines a `CheckConstraint` class that overrides the `__eq__` method to compare two instances of `CheckConstraint` based on specific attributes.

In the given input, two `CheckConstraint` instances are compared. The comparison is done by checking the equality of the `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message` attributes of both instances.

The output structure is defined as a JSON object with a single key "output" and its value is the result of the comparison, which is a boolean value.

The `__eq__` method is comparing two `CheckConstraint` instances. The comparison is done by checking if all the attributes `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message` are equal in both instances.

Based on the input, the `name` attribute is "price" in both instances, the `check` attribute is an instance of a `Q` object with the same properties, the `violation_error_code` attribute is "custom_code" in both instances, and the `violation_error_message` attribute is the same in both instances as well.

Therefore, the result of the comparison is `True`.
