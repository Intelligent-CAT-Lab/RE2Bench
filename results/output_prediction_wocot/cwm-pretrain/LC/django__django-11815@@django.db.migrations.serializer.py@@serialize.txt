        The `serialize` function is being called with `self` as the object containing `value` of `"<IntEnum.A: 1>"`. The `EnumSerializer` class has a `serialize` method that constructs a string representation of an enum instance. The `value` attribute is an instance of an `IntEnum` with the value `A`, which corresponds to `1`. The method formats the output as `"{module}.{class_name}[{enum_value}]"`, where `module` is the module name of the enum class, `class_name` is the name of the enum class, and `enum_value` is the name of the enum member.

    [OUTPUT]
    ```
    {
        "output": "enum.__class__[\"A\"]"
    }
    ```
    [/OUTPUT]

        The `serialize` function constructs a string representation of an enum instance. Given that `value` is an instance of an `IntEnum` with the value `A`, which corresponds to `1`, the function should return a string that represents this enum member correctly. However, my previous response had an issue in the representation of the `output`. The function's formatting should return `"{module}.{class_name}[\"{enum_value}\"]"` where `module` is `enum`, `class_name` is `__class__`, and `enum_value` is `"A"`. Therefore, the correct output should reflect these details accurately.
