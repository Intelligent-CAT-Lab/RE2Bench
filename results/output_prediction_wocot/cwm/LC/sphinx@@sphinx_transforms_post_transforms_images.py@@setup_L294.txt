The function setup is called with an app object of type Sphinx. The function adds two post transforms, ImageDownloader and DataURIExtractor, to the app using the add_post_transform method. Then, it returns a dictionary with the version set to 'builtin', and parallel_read_safe and parallel_write_safe set to True. The input app object is not used in any computation, so the output should be the same regardless of the app object.
