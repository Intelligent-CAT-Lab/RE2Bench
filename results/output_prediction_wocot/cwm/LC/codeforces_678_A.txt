Okay, let's see. The problem is to predict the output of a given Python code snippet with a specific input. The code is:

vamshi, z = map(int, input().split())
print((vamshi // z + 1) * z)

And the input provided is:
{
    "input": "\"14 15\""
}

First, I need to understand what the code does. The first line reads two integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to vamshi and z. The second line calculates (vamshi // z + 1) * z and prints the result.

Let me parse the input. The input string is "14 15". When split, it becomes ["14", "15"], and converting them to integers gives vamshi = 14 and z = 15.

Now, let's compute the expression step by step:

1. vamshi // z: This is integer division of 14 by 15. Since 14 is less than 15, the result is 0.
2. Adding 1 to that result: 0 + 1 = 1.
3. Multiplying by z: 1 * 15 = 15.

So the output should be 15.

But wait, let me double-check. The code uses floor division (//), which for positive numbers is straightforward. Since 14 divided by 15 is 0.933..., the floor is indeed 0. Adding 1 gives 1, multiplied by 15 is 15. That seems right.

I should also consider if there's any edge case I'm missing. For example, if vamshi was a multiple of z, but in this case, 14 is not a multiple of 15. So the calculation holds.

Therefore, the output should be 15.
