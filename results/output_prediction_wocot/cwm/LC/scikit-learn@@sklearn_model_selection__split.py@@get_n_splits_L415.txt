The `get_n_splits` function is called on an instance of `_BaseKFold` with the arguments `X` and `y`. However, the implementation of `get_n_splits` does not use `X` or `y` in any way. It simply returns the value of `self.n_splits`, which is the number of folds specified when creating the instance.

In this case, `self.n_splits` is 3, so the function returns 3.
