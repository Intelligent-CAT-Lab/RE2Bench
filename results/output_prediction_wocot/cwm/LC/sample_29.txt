The function `f` processes the input `text` by filtering out numeric characters. Let's break down the steps:

1. The input text is "-123   \t+314". 
2. The function uses `filter(str.isnumeric, text)` to extract only the numeric characters from the string. 
3. The characters '1', '2', '3', '3', '1', and '4' are numeric and will be included in the result. 
4. These characters are then joined together into a single string "123314". 
5. The function returns this string as the output.
