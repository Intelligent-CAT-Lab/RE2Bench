**Code Analysis**:

The code takes three integers as input: `k`, `n`, and `w`. It calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `k` and the common difference is also `k`, up to `w` terms. If the sum is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints the difference between the sum and `n`.

The arithmetic series sum can be calculated using the formula: sum = `k * w * (w + 1) / 2`.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

1. The input values are `k = 1`, `n = 1`, and `w = 1`.
2. The sum of the series is `1 * 1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1`.
3. Since `sum` equals `n`, the code prints `0`.

**Inputs**:
```
{
    "input": "\"1 1 1\""
}
```

**Output**:
```
{
    "output": 0        
}
```
