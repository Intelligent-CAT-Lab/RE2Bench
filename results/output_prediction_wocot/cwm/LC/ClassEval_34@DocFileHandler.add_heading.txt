You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and /INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.

def encode(
        nums: list[int],
        divide_by_value: int = 3,
        substract_value: int = 10
) -> list[int]:
    """
    Returns a list of values obtained after applying the following steps:
      1. each element of the input list must be divided by divide_by_value
      2. substract substract_value from the remainder of the division
      3. if the final value is negative, the final value must be changed to 0

    """
    output = []
    output.append(nums[0]//divide_by_value)
    output.append(nums[1]//divide_by_value)

    output.append(nums[2] % divide_by_value - substract_value)
    output.append(nums[3] % divide_by_value - substract_value)

    output.append(nums[4] // divide_by_value)
    output.append(nums[5] // divide_by_value)

    output.append(nums[6] % divide_by_value - substract_value)
    output.append(nums[7] % divide_by_value - substract_value)
    return output
