The output of the `_partial_fit` function, given the provided input, is a fitted Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. This classifier will have learned the parameters (mean, variance) of the Gaussian distribution for each class and each feature from the input data. The output will be an instance of the `GaussianNB` class, which can then be used for predictions or further training with additional data.

The parameters learned will be:
- `theta_`: Array of means for each class and feature.
- `var_`: Array of variances for each class and feature.
- `class_count_`: Array of the number of samples seen for each class.
- `class_prior_`: Array of the prior probabilities of each class.

However, as per your request, I will provide the output in the specified format.
