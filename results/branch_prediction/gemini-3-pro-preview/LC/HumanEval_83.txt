[THOUGHT]
The function `starts_one_ends` is called with the argument `n = 5`.

1.  **Line 4:** The code checks `if n == 1:`.
    *   The value of `n` is 5.
    *   The comparison `5 == 1` evaluates to `False`.
    *   Therefore, the branch is **not taken**.
    *   We record executes for this branch execution: `['N']`.

2.  **Line 5:** The function proceeds to calculate `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))` and returns the result.

The final branch annotation for line 4 is `['N']`.
