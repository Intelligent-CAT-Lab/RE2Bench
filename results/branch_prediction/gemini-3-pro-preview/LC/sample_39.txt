[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem = 6`.

1.  **Line 2**: `if elem in array:`
    *   The check is `6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]`.
    *   Since 6 is the first element of the list, this condition evaluates to `True`.
    *   The branch is taken. The annotation should be `['Y']`.

2.  **Line 3**: `return array.index(elem)`
    *   The function returns 0.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
