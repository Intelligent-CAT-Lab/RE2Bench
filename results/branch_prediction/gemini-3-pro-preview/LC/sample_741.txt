[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` and `p = 6`.

1.  **Line 2**: `prev_p = p - 1` is executed.
    *   `p` is 6, so `prev_p` becomes `6 - 1 = 5`.

2.  **Line 3**: The condition `if prev_p < 0:` is evaluated.
    *   `prev_p` is 5.
    *   Is `5 < 0`? No, it is False.
    *   Therefore, the branch is **not taken** ('N').

3.  **Line 4**: `return nums[prev_p]` returns `nums[5]`, which is `1`.

The branch at line 3 is encountered once and not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
