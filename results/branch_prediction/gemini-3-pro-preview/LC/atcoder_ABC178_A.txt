[THOUGHT]
The input provided is `1`.
1. Line 1: `x` is read as integer `1`.
2. Line 2: The condition `x == 1` is checked. Since `x` is `1`, the condition is True. The branch is taken.
3. Line 4: The `else` block is associated with the `if` on line 2. Since the `if` block was executed, the `else` block is skipped (not taken).

So, the annotations correspond to:
- Line 2: taken=['Y']
- Line 4: taken=['N']
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
