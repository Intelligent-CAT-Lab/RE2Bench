To determine the branch annotations, let's trace the execution of the `select` method with the provided input.

**Input Analysis:**
*   `self.table_name`: "table1"
*   `fields`: Not passed in `args` or `kwargs`, so it defaults to `None`.
*   `condition`: Passed in `kwargs` as "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

**Execution Trace:**

1.  **Line 8**: `def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):`
    *   `fields` is `None` (default).
    *   `condition` is "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

2.  **Line 9**: `if (fields is None):`
    *   Since `fields` is indeed `None`, this condition is true.
    *   **Branch outcome**: `['Y']`

3.  **Line 10**: `fields = '*'`
    *   `fields` is now set to `'*'`.

4.  **Line 11**: `else:`
    *   Since the `if` block was taken, the `else` block is skipped.
    *   **Branch outcome**: `['N']`

5.  **Line 13**: `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
    *   `sql` becomes "SELECT * FROM table1".

6.  **Line 14**: `if (condition is not None):`
    *   `condition` is "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", which is not `None`.
    *   The condition is true.
    *   **Branch outcome**: `['Y']`

7.  **Line 15**: `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
    *   `sql` becomes "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

8.  **Line 16**: `return (sql + ';')`
    *   Returns the final string.
