[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace a Python program with input `99`.

1.  `N = int(input())`: Reads "99", so `N` is 99.
2.  `if N % 2 == 0 :`: Checks if 99 is even. `99 % 2` is 1, which is not equal to 0. So the condition is False. The branch is NOT taken (N).
3.  `else :`: Since the `if` condition was false, the code proceeds to the `else` block. This branch IS taken (Y).
    *   Inside the `else` block: `print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )`. It prints `(100)/99/2` which is `100/198` approximately `0.50505...`. This line is executed.

Summary of branches:
Line 2: Condition is false -> 'N'
Line 4: Else branch is entered -> 'Y'

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
