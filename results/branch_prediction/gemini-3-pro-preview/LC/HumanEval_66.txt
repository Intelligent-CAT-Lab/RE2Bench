The function `digitSum` is called with the argument `s = "You arE Very Smart"`.

Tracing the execution:
1.  **Line 4**: `if s == "": return 0`
    *   The input `s` is `"You arE Very Smart"`, which is not an empty string.
    *   The condition `s == ""` evaluates to `False`.
    *   The branch is **NOT taken**.
    *   Annotation for line 4: `['N']`.

2.  **Line 5**: `return sum(ord(char) if char.isupper() else 0 for char in s)`
    *   This is a generator expression being passed to `sum()`. It iterates over every character in `s`. While this is technically branching logic (the `if-else` inside the generator), the prompt format typically asks me to annotate specific markers. There are no markers `## [BRANCH]...` inside the generator expression on line 5 in the provided code snippet. Just to be thorough, the instruction says "replace every '??' in 'taken=??' with your prediction".
    *   Looking at the provided code block:
        ```python
        4     if s == "": return 0 ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        ```
    *   There is only one marker on line 4. So I only need to provide the annotation for line 4.

Coordinate check:
- Line 4: `s` is not empty. Branch taken? N.

Final Annotation:
Line 4: `taken=['N']`
