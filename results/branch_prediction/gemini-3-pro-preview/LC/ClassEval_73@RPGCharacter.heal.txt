Tracing the execution of `heal` method:
1.  **Initial State**: The `RPGCharacter` instance `self` has `hp` = 100.
2.  **Line 14**: `self.hp += 10`. The current `hp` is 100, so `self.hp` becomes 110.
3.  **Line 15**: `if (self.hp > 100):`
    *   The condition is `110 > 100`, which evaluates to `True`.
    *   The branch is taken.
    *   We record `['Y']` for this branch.
4.  **Line 16**: `self.hp = 100`. `self.hp` is reset to 100.
5.  **Line 17**: `return self.hp`. Returns 100.

There is only one branch point at line 15, and it was taken.
