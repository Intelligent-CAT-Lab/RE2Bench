[THOUGHT]
The function `rounded_avg` is called with arguments `n=185` and `m=546`.

1.  **Line 4**: The code checks the condition `if m < n:`.
    *   Evaluating `m < n`: `546 < 185`.
    *   This evaluates to `False`.
    *   Therefore, the branch at line 4 is **not taken**.
    *   This is the only time this check is encountered.
    *   Annotation for this branch: `['N']`.

The rest of the function calculates the sum from 185 to 546 and returns the binary representation of the rounded average, but there are no further branch markers to annotate.
