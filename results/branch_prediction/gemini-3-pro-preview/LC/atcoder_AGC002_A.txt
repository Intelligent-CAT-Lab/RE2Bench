The input is `1 1000000000`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Line 1**: `a, b` are read from input as integers. `a` becomes 1, and `b` becomes 1000000000.
2.  **Line 2**: The condition is `if a <= 0 and 0 <= b`.
    *   Currently, `a` is 1. `a <= 0` is `1 <= 0`, which is `False`.
    *   Since the first part of the `and` is False, the whole condition is False.
    *   The branch at Line 2 is NOT taken (`taken=['N']`).
3.  **Line 4**: This is an `elif` statement. The condition is `elif a < 0 and min(b-a, -a) % 2 == 0`.
    *   `a` is 1. `a < 0` is `1 < 0`, which is `False`.
    *   Since the first part is False, the whole condition is False.
    *   The branch at Line 4 is NOT taken (`taken=['N']`).
4.  **Line 6**: This is the `else` block. Since the `if` and `elif` conditions were false, this block is executed.
    *   The branch at Line 6 is taken (`taken=['Y']`).
5.  **Line 7**: `print("Positive")` is executed.

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 if a <= 0 and 0 <= b : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "Zero" )
4 elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5     print ( "Negative" )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
7     print ( "Positive" )
