[THOUGHT]
The function `template_changed` checks if a specific file path corresponds to a template change as opposed to a Python code change.
The input `file_path` is given as `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html`. While provided as a string in the input JSON, the code accesses `.suffix`, implying it operates on a `pathlib.Path` object.
The code at line 13 checks `if file_path.suffix == '.py':`. 
The suffix of the input file is `.html`.
Since `.html` is not equal to `.py`, the condition evaluates to `False`.
Consequently, the branch at line 13 is not taken. The execution would proceed to the loop starting at line 15, but since there are no branch markers requested for the rest of the function, we only annotate line 13.

Prediction:
Line 13: Not taken -> ['N']
