[THOUGHT]
The input provided is `x = 1` and `n = 1`.
We enter the function `is_simple_power(1, 1)`.

Line 4: `if (n == 1):`
The value of `n` is 1.
The condition `1 == 1` is True.
So the branch is taken.

Line 5: `return (x == 1)`
The function returns `True` immediately.
The rest of the code (lines 6-9) is not executed.

Summary of branches:
Line 4: Taken once ('Y').
