[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int` is called with `x=2`, `y=1`, and `z=1`.

1.  **Line 5:** `if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int):`
    *   `x` is 2, which is an integer. `isinstance(x, int)` is True.
    *   `y` is 1, which is an integer. `isinstance(y, int)` is True.
    *   `z` is 1, which is an integer. `isinstance(z, int)` is True.
    *   The condition is `True and True and True`, which is `True`.
    *   Branch is taken -> 'Y'.

2.  **Line 6:** `if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x):`
    *   First check: `x + y == z` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` -> False.
    *   Second check: `x + z == y` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` -> False.
    *   Third check: `y + z == x` -> `1 + 1 == 2` -> `2 == 2` -> True.
    *   Since it's an `or` chain, the whole condition is True.
    *   Branch is taken -> 'Y'.

3.  **Line 7:** `return True`
    *   The function returns `True` and execution ends.
