[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `str` and `toget`.
Input provided: `str` = "fnuiyh", `toget` = "ni".

Line 2: `if str.startswith(toget):`
We check if "fnuiyh" starts with "ni".
The string "fnuiyh" starts with "fn", not "ni".
So `str.startswith(toget)` evaluates to `False`.
The branch associated with the `if` statement is NOT taken.
The annotation for the first marker should be `[N]`.

Line 3: `else: return str`
Since the `if` condition was false, the code falls through to the `else` block (or effectively executes the `else` logic, although line 3 explicitly has an `else`).
This branch is taken.
The annotation for the second marker shoud be `[Y]`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
