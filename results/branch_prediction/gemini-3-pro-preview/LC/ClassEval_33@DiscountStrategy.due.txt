The user wants me to trace the execution of the `due` method in the `DiscountStrategy` class.

**Input Analysis:**
The input provides an instance of `DiscountStrategy` with the following relevant attributes:
- `self.promotion`: It is provided as a function object description (`"<function inspect_code.<locals>.wrapper at 0x74bd8c9b5d30>"`). This means `self.promotion` is NOT `None`.
- The `cart` is populated, but `due` doesn't iterate over it directly; the constructor supposedly calculated `self.__total` already (which is given as `150.0`).

**Code Execution Trace:**

1.  **Method Call:** `due(self)` is called.
2.  **Line 12:** `if (self.promotion is None):`
    - Check the value of `self.promotion`. From the input, it is a function object, so it is not `None`.
    - The condition evaluates to `False`.
    - The branch corresponding to line 12 is **not taken** ('N').
3.  **Line 14:** `else:`
    - Since the `if` condition was false, the `else` block is executed.
    - The branch corresponding to line 14 is **taken** ('Y').
4.  **Line 15:** `discount = self.promotion(self)` is executed (attempting to call the promotion function).
5.  **Line 16:** `return (self.__total - discount)` returns the final value.

**Summary of Branch Decisions:**
- Line 12 (`if`): Not Taken ('N')
- Line 14 (`else`): Taken ('Y')
