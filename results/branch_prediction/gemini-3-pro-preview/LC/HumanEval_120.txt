[THOUGHT]
The function `maximum` is called with `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.

1.  **Line 4:** The code hits the `if` statement: `if k == 0:`.
2.  **Evaluation:** The value of `k` is `2`. The condition `2 == 0` is `False`.
3.  **Result:** The branch is **not taken**. We record 'N'.

The execution proceeds to sort the array and return the last `k` elements. The branch at line 4 is the only one to annotate.

4     if k == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5         return []
6     arr.sort()
7     ans = arr[-k:]
8     return ans
