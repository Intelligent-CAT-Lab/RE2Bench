[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `text="g"` and `n=15`.

Line 1: `def f(text, n):`
    Inputs are `text = "g"` (length 1) and `n = 15`.

Line 2: `if len(text) <= 2: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]`
    We check the condition `len(text) <= 2`.
    Since `text` is "g", `len(text)` is 1.
    1 <= 2 is True.
    So the branch is taken ('Y').

Line 3: `return text`
    Since the branch was taken, the function executes line 3 and returns "g".
    Lines 4 and 5 are unreachable in this execution.

Branch analysis summary:
Line 2: The condition is met, so the branch is taken. Annotation: `['Y']`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, n):
2     if len(text) <= 2: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return text
4     leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
5     return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
