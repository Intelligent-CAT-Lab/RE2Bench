[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes `items` and a `target`.
Input `items` is `['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+']`.
Input `target` is `'**'`.
Line 2 executes the check `if target in items:`.
The target `**` is present in the `items` list (it's the 4th element).
Since `'**'` is in the list, the condition evaluates to `True`.
The branch is taken.
The function then returns the index of the target (which would be 3) at line 3.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
