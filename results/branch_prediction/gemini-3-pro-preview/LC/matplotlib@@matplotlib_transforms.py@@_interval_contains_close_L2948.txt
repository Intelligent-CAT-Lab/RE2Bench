[THOUGHT]
The function `_interval_contains_close` takes `interval`, `val`, and `rtol`.
The input provides `interval` as an array-like string which likely represents a list or tuple `[0.0, 2.0]`.
The `val` is `0.0`.
`rtol` is default `1e-10`.

Line 2: `a, b = interval`. `interval` is `[0.0, 2.0]`. So `a = 0.0`, `b = 2.0`.
Line 3: `if a > b:`. We check `0.0 > 2.0`. This is False.
So the branch at line 3 is NOT taken.
Line 4 is skipped.
Line 5: `rtol` calculation.
Line 6: Returns result.

Therefore, the only branch at line 3 is taken=['N'].

1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
