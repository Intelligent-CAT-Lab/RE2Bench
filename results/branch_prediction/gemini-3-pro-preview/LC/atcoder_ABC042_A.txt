[THOUGHT]
The input string is `'7 5 5'`.

1.  **Line 2:** `ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))`
    *   `input().split()` produces `['7', '5', '5']`.
    *   `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to integers: `7, 5, 5`.
    *   `tuple(...)` creates the tuple `ABC = (7, 5, 5)`.

2.  **Line 3:** `if ABC.count(5) == 2 :`
    *   We check how many times the integer `5` appears in `ABC`.
    *   `ABC` is `(7, 5, 5)`.
    *   `ABC.count(5)` returns `2`.
    *   The condition `2 == 2` is `True`.
    *   Therefore, the branch at line 3 is **taken**. Mark `taken=['Y']`.

3.  **Line 4:** `print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )`
    *   This line executes. It's not marked with a branch comment in the provided snippet (branch comments are usually on `if`, `elif`, `for`, `while` headers, or `else` blocks). Wait, line 4 has an inline ternary operator but no explicit `[BRANCH]` marker provided in the code text I need to reproduce. Wait, actually, the branch marker is on line 3 and line 5. Let's look at the markers provided.
    *   Marker on line 3: `if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]` -> calculated as `['Y']`.
    *   Marker on line 5: `else : ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]` -> Since the `if` was taken, the `else` block is **skipped/not taken**. Mark this `taken=['N']`. Note on standard behavior: usually, we only mark branches that are essentially evaluated. If the `if` is true, execution enters the block. The `else` keyword defines the alternate path. Is the "else branch" considered "encountered"? In tracing tools, often we mark the decision. Here, the prompt asks to replace `??` for every occurrence of the marker. Since execution flows into the `if` block, it does *not* flow into the `else` block. So the `else` marker should indicate it wasn't taken. In our standard format for this task, if the `if` branch is taken ('Y'), the corresponding `else` is 'N'.

Let's double check the logic inside line 4 just for completeness (though it doesn't affect the branch markers requested):
`sum(ABC)` = 7 + 5 + 5 = 17. `17 == 17` is True. So it prints 'YES'.

Summary of branch markers:
Line 3: `if ABC.count(5) == 2 :` -> True -> `['Y']`
Line 5: `else :` -> Not entered -> `['N']`
