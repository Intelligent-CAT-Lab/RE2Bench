[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers A and B from the input.
Input is "20 30".
So, A = 20, B = 30.

Line 2 calculates `ans = A - 2 * B`.
`ans = 20 - 2 * 30`
`ans = 20 - 60`
`ans = -40`

Line 3 checks the condition `if ans < 0 :`.
The current value of `ans` is -40.
Is -40 < 0? Yes, this is True.
The branch is taken.

Since the branch is taken, line 4 `ans = 0` is executed, setting `ans` to 0.
Line 5 prints `ans`, which is 0.

The branch at line 3 is encountered once and taken.
Prediction: ['Y']

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
