[THOUGHT]
The function `_cmp_name` compares two classes `x` and `y` for sorting purposes within SymPy.

1.  **Arguments**:
    *   `x`: `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>`. `x.__name__` is `'ImaginaryUnit'`.
    *   `y`: `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>`. `y.__name__` is `'Pi'`.

2.  **Line 4**: `if n1 == n2:`
    *   `n1` is `'ImaginaryUnit'`.
    *   `n2` is `'Pi'`.
    *   They are not equal.
    *   Branch outcome: **['N']**.

3.  **Line 7**: `if not issubclass(y, Basic):`
    *   `y` is the class `sympy.core.numbers.Pi`.
    *   In the SymPy library hierarchy, `Pi` inherits from `Number`, which inherits from `AtomicExpr`, which inherits from `Expr`, which inherits from `Basic`.
    *   Therefore, `issubclass(y, Basic)` is `True`.
    *   The condition `not True` is `False`.
    *   Branch outcome: **['N']**.

4.  **Lines 10-18**: Determining indices in `ordering_of_classes`.
    *   `ordering_of_classes` is a list used by SymPy to define a canonical ordering of its types. Standard mathematical types like `ImaginaryUnit` and `Pi` are included in this list.
    *   `ordering_of_classes.index('ImaginaryUnit')` will find an index (assigned to `i1`).
    *   `ordering_of_classes.index('Pi')` will find an index (assigned to `i2`).
    *   Consequently, `i1` is not `UNKNOWN`, and `i2` is not `UNKNOWN`.

5.  **Line 19**: `if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN:`
    *   Since both `i1` and `i2` were found (are standard integers), they are not equal to `UNKNOWN`.
    *   The condition is `False`.
    *   Branch outcome: **['N']**.

Summary of branches: Line 4 is N, Line 7 is N, Line 19 is N.
