[THOUGHT]
The input is the string "2.4".

1.  `num = input ( ) . split ( "." )`
    - input() reads "2.4".
    - .split(".") creates the list `num = ['2', '4']`.

2.  `if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 :`
    - `num[0]` is '2'.
    - `num[0][-1]` is the last character of '2', which is '2'.
    - `int('2')` is 2.
    - Check if 2 == 9. This is False.
    - Branch taken: ['N'].

4.  `else :`
    - Since the `if` condition was False, we enter the `else` block.
    - Branch taken: ['Y'].

5.  `if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 :`
    - `num[1]` is '4'.
    - `num[1][0]` is the first character of '4', which is '4'.
    - `int('4')` is 4.
    - Check if 4 >= 5. This is False.
    - Branch taken: ['N'].

7.  `else :`
    - Since the inner `if` condition was False, we enter the inner `else` block.
    - Branch taken: ['Y'].

8.  `print ( num [ 0 ] )`
    - Prints '2'.

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
