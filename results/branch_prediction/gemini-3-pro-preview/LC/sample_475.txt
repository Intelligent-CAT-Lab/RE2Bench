[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `array` = `[1]` and `index` = `0`.

Tracing the execution:
1.  Line 2: The condition is `if index < 0`.
    *   Here, `index` is `0`.
    *   Is `0 < 0`? No, it is False.
    *   Therefore, the branch is NOT taken.
    *   Annotation for line 2 will be `['N']`.

2.  Line 4: `return array[index]` is executed. `array[0]` is `1`. The function returns.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
