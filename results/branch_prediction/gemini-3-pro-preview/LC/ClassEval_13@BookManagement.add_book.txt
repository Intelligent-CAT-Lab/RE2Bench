[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the `add_book` method of the `BookManagement` class.

**1. Initial State:**
- `self.inventory` is initialized with `{'book1': 2, 'book2': 1}` based on the input.
- The method called is `add_book` with argument `title="book2"`.
- The `quantity` argument is not provided in the input, so it takes the default value of `1`.

**2. Execution Trace:**
- **Line 9:** `if (title in self.inventory):`
    - `title` is `"book2"`.
    - Is `"book2"` in `{'book1': 2, 'book2': 1}`? Yes.
    - The condition `title in self.inventory` evaluates to `True`.
    - Therefore, the branch is **taken**. I will append 'Y'.

- **Line 10:** `self.inventory[title] += quantity`
    - `self.inventory["book2"]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Line 11:** `else:`
    - Since the `if` block was executed, the `else` block is skipped.
    - Therefore, the branch is **not taken**. I will append 'N'.

**3. Summary of Branch Decisions:**
- Line 9: `title in self.inventory` -> True -> 'Y'
- Line 11: `else` -> False -> 'N'
