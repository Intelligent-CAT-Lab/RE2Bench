[THOUGHT]
The code logic is as follows:
1.  Read `k`, `n`, `w` from input.
    Input is `1 1 1`.
    `k = 1`, `n = 1`, `w = 1`.

2.  Initialize `sum = 0`.

3.  Loop `for i in range(1, w + 1)`:
    `range(1, 1 + 1)` is `range(1, 2)`, which yields `i = 1`.
    Loop iteration 1 (i=1):
    Line 4: `sum += k * i` => `sum += 1 * 1` => `sum = 0 + 1 => 1`.

4.  Loop finishes.

5.  Line 5: Check `if sum <= n`:
    `sum` is 1. `n` is 1.
    Is `1 <= 1`? Yes, it is True.
    So the branch is taken ('Y').

Therefore, the annotation for the branch at line 5 is `['Y']`.

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
