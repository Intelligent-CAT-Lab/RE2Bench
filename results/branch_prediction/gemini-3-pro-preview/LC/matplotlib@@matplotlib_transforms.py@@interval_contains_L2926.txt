[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the execution of `interval_contains` based on the provided input.

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    *   `interval`: An array-like structure (based on the string representation `array([-107.73502692, -7.73502692])`).
    *   `val`: -80.0.

2.  **Execution Trace**:
    *   Line 1: `def interval_contains(interval, val):` is called.
    *   Line 2: `a, b = interval`.
        *   `a` becomes -107.73502692.
        *   `b` becomes -7.73502692.
    *   Line 3: `if a > b:`
        *   Is -107.73502692 > -7.73502692?
        *   No. -107 is smaller (more negative) than -7.
        *   Condition is False.
        *   Branch taken is `N`.
    *   Line 4: Skipped.
    *   Line 5: `return a <= val <= b`.
        *   Returns True (-107.7... <= -80.0 <= -7.7...).

3.  **Result**:
    *   Line 3 branch: `['N']`.

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
