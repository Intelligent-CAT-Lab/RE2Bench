[THOUGHT]
The method `_route_params` receives `params` containing `{'sample_weight': [1], 'metadata': 'a'}`. It computes `args` containing these same keys/values since neither is None.
The loop iterates over `self._requests`, which has two entries: `sample_weight=True` and `metadata=True`.

Iteration 1 (prop='sample_weight', alias=True):
1. Line 24 (`if alias is False or alias == WARN`): `alias` is `True`. `True is False` is False. `True == WARN` is False. Branch taken: **N**.
2. Line 26 (`elif alias is True and prop in args`): `alias` is `True` and 'sample_weight' is in `args`. Condition is True. Branch taken: **Y**.
   - Body executes, adding to `res`.
   - Lines 28 and 30 are part of the if/elif chain and are skipped because Line 26 was taken.

Iteration 2 (prop='metadata', alias=True):
1. Line 24: `alias` is `True`. Branch taken: **N**.
2. Line 26: `alias` is `True` and 'metadata' is in `args`. Condition is True. Branch taken: **Y**.
   - Body executes, adding to `res`.
   - Lines 28 and 30 are skipped.

After the loop:
- `unrequested` dictionary remains empty because the code path (Line 28/29) that populates it was never entered.
- Line 32 (`if unrequested`): Empty dict is falsy. Branch taken: **N**.

Predictions:
Line 24: ['N', 'N']
Line 26: ['Y', 'Y']
Line 28: []
Line 30: []
Line 32: ['N']
