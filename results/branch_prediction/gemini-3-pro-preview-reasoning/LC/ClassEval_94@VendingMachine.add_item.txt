The execution trace for the `add_item` method with the provided input is as follows:

1.  **Method Call**: `add_item` is called with `item_name="Coke"`, `price=1.25`, `quantity=10`. The instance's `inventory` already contains "Coke".
2.  **Line 10**: The condition `if (not self.restock_item(item_name, quantity)):` requires evaluating `self.restock_item("Coke", 10)`.
    *   **Context Switch**: Execution moves to `restock_item`.
3.  **Line 14 (inside `restock_item`)**: The condition `if (item_name in self.inventory):` is checked.
    *   Current `inventory` is `{"Coke": ...}`.
    *   `"Coke"` is in `inventory`. The condition is **True**.
    *   **Annotation**: Line 14 branch is taken -> `['Y']`.
4.  **Lines 15-16**: The inventory is updated, and the method specifically returns `True` at Line 16.
5.  **Line 17 (inside `restock_item`)**: Since the `if` branch was taken (and the function returned), the `else` branch is **not** taken.
    *   **Annotation**: Line 17 branch is not taken -> `['N']`.
6.  **Back to Line 10 (inside `add_item`)**: `restock_item` returned `True`.
    *   The condition becomes `if (not True):`, which is `if (False):`.
    *   The branch is **not** taken.
    *   **Annotation**: Line 10 branch is not taken -> `['N']`.
