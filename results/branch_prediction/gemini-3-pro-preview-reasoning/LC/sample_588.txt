[THOUGHT]
The function `f` checks if `target` exists in the list `items`.
Input `items` is `['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+']`.
Input `target` is `'**'`.
Line 2: `if target in items:` checks for membership.
Since `'**'` is an element of the list `items`, the condition is `True`.
Therefore, the branch is taken once.
The branch annotation becomes `['Y']`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
