[THOUGHT]
The method `__lt__` is executed with `self` corresponding to an `Integer` object with value 3, and `other` corresponding to "1".
1. Line 13: `other = _sympify(other)` is called. `_sympify("1")` converts the input into a SymPy `Integer(1)` object.
2. Line 16: The condition `if other.is_Integer:` is checked. Since `other` is an `Integer` instance, its `is_Integer` attribute is `True` (defined in line 8).
3. Consequently, the branch is taken ('Y'). The code proceeds to line 17 to return the comparison result.
