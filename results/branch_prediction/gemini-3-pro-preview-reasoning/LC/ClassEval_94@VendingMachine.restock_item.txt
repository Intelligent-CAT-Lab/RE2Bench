[THOUGHT]
The input to the execution is the method `restock_item` of the class `VendingMachine`.
The initial state is:
`self.inventory` = `{'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}`
`item_name` = `"Pizza"`
`quantity` = `10`

tracing the execution:
1. Line 10: `if (item_name in self.inventory):` checks if `"Pizza"` is a key in `self.inventory`.
   `self.inventory` keys are `['Coke']`. `"Pizza"` is not present.
   The condition evaluates to `False`.
   The `if` branch is NOT taken. The marker at Line 10 becomes `['N']`.

2. Line 13: `else:`
   Since the `if` condition was false, execution flows to the `else` block.
   The `else` branch IS taken. The marker at Line 13 becomes `['Y']`.

3. Line 14: `return False`. Execution ends.
