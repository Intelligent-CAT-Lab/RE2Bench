[THOUGHT]
The input is provided as `7 5 5`.
1.  **Line 2 execution**: `input().split()` reads the string `"7 5 5"` and splits it into `['7', '5', '5']`. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to the integers `7`, `5`, and `5`. `tuple(...)` creates the tuple `ABC = (7, 5, 5)`.
2.  **Line 3 execution**: The statement `if ABC.count(5) == 2 :` is evaluated.
    *   `ABC` is `(7, 5, 5)`.
    *   `ABC.count(5)` returns the number of times `5` appears in the tuple, which is `2`.
    *   The condition `2 == 2` is `True`.
    *   Therefore, the branch at line 3 is **taken**. We record `['Y']`.
3.  **Line 4 execution**: Since the `if` condition was true, the code enters the `if` block. It executes the print statement (`sum(ABC)` is `17`, so it prints `'YES'`).
4.  **Line 5 execution**: The `else` block follows the `if`. Since the `if` branch was taken, the `else` branch is skipped (not taken).
    *   While the line itself might not be "executed" in a step-by-step debugger trace, logically the `else` path was considered and rejected / not chosen.
    *   Therefore, the branch at line 5 is **not taken**. We record `['N']`.

Summary:
Line 3: `['Y']`
Line 5: `['N']`

1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
