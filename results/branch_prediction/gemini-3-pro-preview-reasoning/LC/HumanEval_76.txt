[THOUGHT]
The function `is_simple_power` is called with arguments `x=1` and `n=1`.
Trace:
1. Line 4: `if (n == 1):` checks if `n` is equal to 1.
   Here `n` is 1, so the condition `1 == 1` is `True`.
   The branch is taken. We append 'Y'.
2. Line 5: `return (x == 1)` is executed. The function returns `True` and exits.
3. The rest of the code (lines 6-9) is not executed.

Branch annotation:
Line 4: Condition is True -> `['Y']`
