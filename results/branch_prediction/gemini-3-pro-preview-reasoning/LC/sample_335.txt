[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with arguments `text="sjbrlfqmw"` and `to_remove="l"`.
1. Line 2: `new_text` is created as a list of characters: `['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'l', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w']`.
2. Line 3: The conditional check `if to_remove in new_text:` is performed. `to_remove` is `"l"`. Since `"l"` is present in the list `new_text` (at index 4), the condition evaluates to `True`.
   - The branch is taken. We record 'Y'.
3. Lines 4-7: The code proceeds to find the index of "l", remove it, insert a placeholder '?', and remove the placeholder immediately.
The conditional statement is encountered exactly once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, to_remove):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     if to_remove in new_text: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4         index = new_text.index(to_remove)
5         new_text.remove(to_remove)
6         new_text.insert(index, '?')
7         new_text.remove('?')
8     return ''.join(new_text)
