[THOUGHT]
The program starts by reading two integers from the input `20 30`.
1. `A` is assigned 20 and `B` is assigned 30.
2. The variable `ans` is calculated as `A - 2 * B`.
   `ans = 20 - 2 * 30`
   `ans = 20 - 60`
   `ans = -40`
3. The code checks the condition `if ans < 0 :`.
   Since -40 is indeed less than 0, the condition is true. The branch is taken ('Y').
4. The body of the `if` statement executes, setting `ans = 0`.
5. The program prints `ans`.

So, the branch at line 3 is taken once.

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
