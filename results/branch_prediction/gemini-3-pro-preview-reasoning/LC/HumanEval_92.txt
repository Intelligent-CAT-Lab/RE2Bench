[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int` is called with arguments `x=2`, `y=1`, `z=1`.

1.  **Line 5**: Check `if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)`:
    *   `x` is 2 (int).
    *   `y` is 1 (int).
    *   `z` is 1 (int).
    *   The condition evaluates to `True`.
    *   Branch outcome: **taken** ('Y').

2.  **Line 6**: Check `if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x)`:
    *   `x + y == z` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` is `False`.
    *   `x + z == y` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` is `False`.
    *   `y + z == x` -> `1 + 1 == 2` -> `2 == 2` is `True`.
    *   Since at least one condition in the `or` chain is true, the overall condition is `True`.
    *   Branch outcome: **taken** ('Y').

3.  **Line 7**: `return True` is executed.
