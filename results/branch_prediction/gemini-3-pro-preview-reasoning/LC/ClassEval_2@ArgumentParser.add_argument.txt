[THOUGHT]
1. Method `add_argument` is called with arguments matching the input:
   - `arg` = "age"
   - `required` = `False` (from kwargs)
   - `arg_type` = `int` (from kwargs, denoted as `<class 'int'>` in input dump but treated as the type object or equivalent handling in Python logic).

2. Trace execution:
   - Line 11: `if required:`
     The variable `required` is `False`.
     The condition evaluates to False.
     Branch logic: Not taken.
     Branch marker `taken=??` becomes `taken=['N']`.

   - Line 12: `self.required.add(arg)` is skipped.
   - Line 13: `self.types[arg] = arg_type` executes normally.

3. Final Conclusion: Only one branch encounter, outcome is 'N'.
