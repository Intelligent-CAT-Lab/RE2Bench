[THOUGHT]
The function `maximum` is called with `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.

1.  **Line 4**: The code checks `if k == 0`.
    *   The value of `k` is 2.
    *   `2 == 0` evaluates to `False`.
    *   Therefore, the branch is **not taken**.
    *   Annotation for this execution: `['N']`.

2.  **Line 6**: `arr.sort()` sorts the array. `arr` remains `[-4, 4]`.
3.  **Line 7**: `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last 2 elements.
4.  **Line 8**: Returns `ans`.

So the only branch annotation required is for line 4, which is `['N']`.
