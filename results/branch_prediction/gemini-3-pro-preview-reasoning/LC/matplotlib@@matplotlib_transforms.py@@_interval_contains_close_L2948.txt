[THOUGHT]
The function `_interval_contains_close` is called with arguments derived from the input specification. 
`interval` is given as `"array([0., 2.])"`, which implies an iterable (likely a list or numpy array) containing `0.0` and `2.0`.
Line 2 unpacks this interval: `a, b = interval`. So, `a = 0.0` and `b = 2.0`.
Line 3 checks the condition `if a > b:`.
Substituting the values: `0.0 > 2.0` evaluates to `False`.
Therefore, the code block inside the `if` statement (line 4) is skipped.
The branch at line 3 is not taken. The list of outcomes for this branch is `['N']`.

3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
