The method `change_order_status` is executed with the provided input.

1.  **Input State**:
    *   `self.orders`: According to the JSON input, this is `{"1": {'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 5, 'status': 'Delivered'}}`. Note that the key is the string `"1"`.
    *   `order_id`: According to the `args` in the input, this is the integer `1`.
    *   `status`: `"Delivered"`.

2.  **Execution Trace**:
    *   **Line 10**: `if (order_id in self.orders):`
        *   The code checks if `order_id` (which is integer `1`) exists as a key in the dictionary `self.orders`.
        *   The keys in `self.orders` are strings (`"1"`).
        *   In Python, an integer `1` is not equal to a string `"1"`, and thus `1 in {"1": ...}` evaluates to `False`.
        *   The `if` branch is **not taken**.
        *   Annotation: `['N']`.

    *   **Line 12**: `else:`
        *   Since the `if` condition was `False`, the control flow enters the `else` block.
        *   The `else` branch is **taken**.
        *   Annotation: `['Y']`.
    
    *   **Line 13**: `return False` is executed.
