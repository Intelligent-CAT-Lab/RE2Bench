[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem = 6`.
Line 2: `if elem in array:` checks if `6` is present in the list `[6, 2, 7, 1]`.
Since `6` is the first element of the array, the condition evaluates to `True`.
Therefore, the branch at line 2 is taken ('Y').
The function then executes line 3 and returns `0`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
