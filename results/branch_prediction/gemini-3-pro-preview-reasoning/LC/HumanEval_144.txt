[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify` takes two arguments `x` and `n`, which represent fractions in string format "numerator/denominator". The input provided is `x = "7/2"` and `n = "4/2"`.

1.  **Line 4**: `a, b = x.split("/")`
    `x` is "7/2", so `a` becomes "7" and `b` becomes "2".
2.  **Line 5**: `c, d = n.split("/")`
    `n` is "4/2", so `c` becomes "4" and `d` becomes "2".
3.  **Line 6**: `numerator = int(a) * int(c)`
    `numerator` = 7 * 4 = 28.
4.  **Line 7**: `denom = int(b) * int(d)`
    `denom` = 2 * 2 = 4.
5.  **Line 8**: `if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)):`
    The expression calculates `28 / 4`, which results in `7.0` (float).
    `int(7.0)` results in `7` (integer).
    The comparison `7.0 == 7` evaluates to `True`.
    Therefore, the branch logic is satisfied.
    Branch Taken: **Y**.
6.  **Line 9**: Returns `True`.

The branch at line 8 is encountered once and taken.
Annotation: `taken=['Y']`
