[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with arguments `text = "g"` and `n = 15`.

1.  **Line 2**: `if len(text) <= 2:`
    *   Calculates `len("g")`, which is `1`.
    *   Checks if `1 <= 2`. This evaluates to `True`.
    *   Since the condition is true, the branch is taken. We mark this with `'Y'`.

2.  **Line 3**: `return text`
    *   The function returns `"g"`. The execution stops here.

The branch at line 2 was encountered once and taken.
Annotation: `[BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]`

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, n):
2     if len(text) <= 2: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return text
4     leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
5     return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
