[THOUGHT]
The code execution is traced as follows:

1.  **State Initialization**: The `Hotel` instance is initialized with the state provided in the input:
    *   `self.booked_rooms`: `{'single': {}}`
    *   `self.available_rooms`: `{'single': 1, 'double': 2}`
    The arguments for the method `check_in` are:
    *   `room_type`: `"single"`
    *   `room_number`: `2`
    *   `name`: `"guest 1"`

2.  **Line 11 Trace**: `if (room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()):`
    *   `room_type` is `"single"`.
    *   `self.booked_rooms.keys()` contains `['single']`.
    *   The condition `"single" not in ...` evaluates to **False**.
    *   The branch is not taken. Annotation: `['N']`.

3.  **Line 13 Trace**: `if (name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]):`
    *   `self.booked_rooms["single"]` is `{}` (empty dictionary).
    *   `name` is `"guest 1"`.
    *   The condition `"guest 1" in {}` evaluates to **False**.
    *   The branch is not taken. Annotation: `['N']`.

4.  **Lines 14-19 Trace**:
    *   Since the condition at line 13 was False, the execution flow skips the entire `if` block.
    *   Lines 14, 16, and the `else` at line 18 are never reached/encountered.
    *   Consequently, their branch annotations are empty lists `[]`.

Final Branch Outcomes:
*   Line 11: `['N']`
*   Line 13: `['N']`
*   Line 14: `[]`
*   Line 16: `[]`
*   Line 18: `[]`
