[THOUGHT]
The input is `99`.
1. Line 1: `N` is assigned the integer value 99.
2. Line 2: The condition `N % 2 == 0` is checked. `99 % 2` equals `1`, which is not `0`. The condition is False.
   - The branch at Line 2 is NOT taken. annotation: `['N']`.
3. Execution moves to the `else` block.
4. Line 4: Since the `if` condition was False, the `else` block is entered.
   - The branch at Line 4 is taken. annotation: `['Y']`.
5. Line 5: The print statement executes.

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
