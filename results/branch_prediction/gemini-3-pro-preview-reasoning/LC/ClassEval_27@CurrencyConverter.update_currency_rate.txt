[THOUGHT]
The method `update_currency_rate` is called with `currency="CNY"` and `new_rate=7.18`.
The `self` object provided in the input has a `rates` dictionary that includes keys such as "USD", "EUR", ..., and notably "CNY".

Tracing the code:
1.  **Line 9**: `if (currency not in self.rates):`
    *   The `currency` variable holds the string "CNY".
    *   We check if "CNY" is absent from `self.rates`.
    *   Since "CNY" is present in `self.rates`, the condition `currency not in self.rates` evaluates to `False`.
    *   Therefore, the branch logic (returning `False`) is skipped.
    *   We record this branch decision as `['N']`.

2.  **Line 11**: `self.rates[currency] = new_rate`
    *   The value for key "CNY" is updated to 7.18. This is the normal flow since the branch was not taken.

Only one branch point exists in the snippet at line 9. It was executed once and was not taken.
