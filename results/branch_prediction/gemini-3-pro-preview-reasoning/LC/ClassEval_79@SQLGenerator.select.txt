[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class.

1.  **Initialize Object**:
    `self.table_name` is set to `"table1"`.

2.  **Method Call**:
    `select` is called with arguments from `args` (empty) and `kwargs` (`{"condition": "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"}`).
    Therefore:
    *   `fields` takes default `None`.
    *   `condition` is `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.

3.  **Trace Variable `fields`** (Line 9-12):
    *   Line 9: `if (fields is None):`
        *   `fields` is `None`. The condition is `True`.
        *   Branch taken.
        *   Annotation for Line 9: `['Y']`.
    *   Line 10: `fields = '*'` executes.
    *   Line 11: `else:`
        *   Since the `if` block was executed, the `else` block is skipped.
        *   Annotation for Line 11: `['N']`.

4.  **Trace Variable `condition`** (Line 14-15):
    *   Line 13: `sql` string is constructed.
    *   Line 14: `if (condition is not None):`
        *   `condition` is `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`, which is not `None`.
        *   The condition is `True`.
        *   Branch taken.
        *   Annotation for Line 14: `['Y']`.
    *   Line 15: `sql` is modified.

5.  **Return**:
    *   Line 16: Returns the SQL string.

Summary of branches:
*   Line 9: `['Y']`
*   Line 11: `['N']`
*   Line 14: `['Y']`
