[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the branch execution of the `match` method in the `RegexUtils` class.

**Input Data:**
- `pattern`: `r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"` (Note: The JSON input uses double backslashes, resolving to single backslashes in the string). This is a standard email validation regex.
- `text`: `"iustd87t2euhifg.com"`

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Line 7**: `ans = re.match(pattern, text)`
   - `re.match` attempts to match the regex pattern at the *beginning* of the string `text`.
   - The pattern expects a structure roughly like `username@domain.tld`.
   - Specifically, it looks for characters, then an `@` symbol.
   - The text `"iustd87t2euhifg.com"` consists of alphanumeric characters followed by a dot and "com". It is completely missing the `@` symbol required by the regex part `...@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+...`.
   - Therefore, `re.match` will fail to find a match and return `None`.
   - `ans` is `None`.

2. **Line 8**: `if ans: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]`
   - `ans` is `None`, which evaluates to `False` in a boolean context.
   - The condition is not met.
   - Branch annotation: `taken=['N']`.

3. **Line 10**: `else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]`
   - Since the `if` condition was false, execution falls through to the `else` block.
   - Branch annotation: `taken=['Y']`.

4. **Line 11**: `return False`
   - The method returns `False`.

**Conclusion:**
- The first branch check at Line 8 is `['N']`.
- The second branch check at Line 10 (the else block) is `['Y']`.
