[THOUGHT]
The code reads an input line, splits it into tokens, and converts them to integers.
The input provided is `1 1`.

1.  `x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )`: The input string "1 1" is split into the list `['1', '1']`.
2.  `for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :`: The loop iterates 2 times.
    -   `x` is converted to `[1, 1]`.
3.  `a = x [ 0 ]` assigns `a = 1`.
4.  `b = x [ 1 ]` assigns `b = 1`.
5.  `print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )` prints `1 `.

6.  Line 7: `if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 :` checks the condition.
    -   `abs(a - b)` = `abs(1 - 1)` = 0.
    -   Condition `0 >= 2` is False.
    -   The branch is not taken. This branch marker records `['N']`.

7.  Line 9: `else :`
    -   Since the `if` condition was False, the `else` block is executed.
    -   The branch is taken. This branch marker records `['Y']`.
    -   `print ( 0 )` prints `0`.

The execution finishes.
The collected branch behaviors are:
Line 7: `['N']`
Line 9: `['Y']`

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
