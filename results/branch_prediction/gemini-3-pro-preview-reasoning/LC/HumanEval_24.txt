[THOUGHT]
The function `largest_divisor` is called with `n = 3`.

1.  **Line 5:** The loop iterates over `reversed(range(3))`. `range(3)` produces `0, 1, 2`. Reversing it yields `2, 1, 0`.

2.  **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Line 5:** `i` becomes `2`.
    *   **Line 6:** The condition is `if n % i == 0`. Substituting values: `3 % 2 == 0`. Since `3 % 2` is `1`, the condition is `False`.
    *   **Outcome:** The branch is not taken ('N').

3.  **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Line 5:** `i` becomes `1`.
    *   **Line 6:** The condition is `if n % i == 0`. Substituting values: `3 % 1 == 0`. Since `3 % 1` is `0`, the condition is `True`.
    *   **Outcome:** The branch is taken ('Y').
    *   **Line 7:** The function returns `1` and terminates.

The sequence of branch decisions at Line 6 is `['N', 'Y']`.
