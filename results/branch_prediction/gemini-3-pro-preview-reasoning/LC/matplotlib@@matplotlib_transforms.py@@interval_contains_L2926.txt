[THOUGHT]
The function `interval_contains` is called with `interval` equivalent to `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]` and `val` as `-80.0`.
At line 2, `a, b = interval` assigns `a = -107.73502692` and `b = -7.73502692`.
At line 3, the condition `if a > b:` is checked.
Comparing the values: `-107.73502692 > -7.73502692` is False because -107 is less than -7.
Therefore, the branch is not taken.

1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
