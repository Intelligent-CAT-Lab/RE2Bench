[THOUGHT]
The function `rounded_avg` is executed with inputs `n = 185` and `m = 546`.
At line 4, the condition `if m < n:` is evaluated.
Substituting the input values: `546 < 185`.
This expression evaluates to `False`.
Consequently, the branch is not taken. Since this line is executed only once, the branch prediction list is `['N']`.
The rest of the function calculates the average, but contains no further marked branches to annotate.
