[THOUGHT]
The input provided is `1`.
1. **Line 1**: `x = int(input())`. The input string is " 1", so `x` becomes `1`.
2. **Line 2**: `if x == 1 :`. We check the condition `x == 1`. Since `x` is `1`, `1 == 1` evaluates to `True`. The `if` branch is taken. 
   - Annotation for Line 2: `taken=['Y']`.
3. **Line 3**: `print(0)` is executed.
4. **Line 4**: `else :`. Since the condition in Line 2 was `True` and the `if` block was executed, the `else` block is skipped (not taken).
   - Annotation for Line 4: `taken=['N']`.

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
