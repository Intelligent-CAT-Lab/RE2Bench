The input `n` is `13441`. We trace the execution of the method `is_prime(n)`:

1.  **Line 5**: The check `if n < 2` is evaluated.
    *   `13441 < 2` is `False`.
    *   The branch is **not taken**.
    *   Annotation: `taken=['N']`.

2.  **Line 7**: The code executes `for k in range(2, n - 1)`.
    *   The `range(2, n - 1)` with `n = 13441` generates integers from `2` up to `13440` (inclusive start, exclusive end). The values for `k` are `2, 3, ..., 13439`.
    *   The total number of iterations is $13439 - 2 + 1 = 13438$.

3.  **Line 8**: Inside the loop, the check `if n % k == 0` is evaluated for each `k`.
    *   We need to determine if `13441` is divisible by any integer from `2` to `13439`.
    *   We can check for primality by testing factors up to $\sqrt{13441} \approx 115.9$.
    *   Checking small prime factors:
        *   Not divisible by 2 (odd).
        *   Sum of digits $1+3+4+4+1 = 13$, not divisible by 3.
        *   Does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible by 5.
        *   $13441 = 7 \times 1920 + 1$ (Remainder 1).
        *   $13441 = 11 \times 1221 + 10$ (Remainder 10).
        *   $13441 = 13 \times 1033 + 12$ (Remainder 12).
        *   $13441 = 17 \times 790 + 11$ (Remainder 11).
        *   $13441 = 19 \times 707 + 8$ (Remainder 8).
        *   Checking primes up to 113 reveals no factors (e.g., $13441 / 113 = 118$ rem $107$).
    *   Since `13441` is a prime number, the condition `n % k == 0` is never true for any `k` in the range.
    *   The branch is evaluated 13,438 times and is **never taken**.
    *   Since the list of 13,438 'N's is too long to display literally, we use the Python list repetition syntax to represent it.
    *   Annotation: `taken=['N'] * 13438`.

4.  **Line 10**: The loop completes, and `return True` is executed.
