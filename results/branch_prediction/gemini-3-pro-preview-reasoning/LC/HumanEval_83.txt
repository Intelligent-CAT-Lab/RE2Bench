[THOUGHT]
The function `starts_one_ends` is called with argument `n = 5`.
Line 4: Check `if n == 1`.
Since `n` is 5, `n == 1` evaluates to `False`.
Therefore, the `if` branch is not taken.
The `return` statement inside the `if` block is skipped.
The function proceeds to line 5 to return the calculated value.

The branch at line 4 is encountered exactly once.
Outcome: Not Taken ('N').
Annotation: `taken=['N']`.
