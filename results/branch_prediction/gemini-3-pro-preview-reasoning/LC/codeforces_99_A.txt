[THOUGHT]
The input provided is `2.4`.
1. `num = input ( ) . split ( "." )` reads "2.4" and splits it by ".", resulting in `num = ['2', '4']`.
2. Line 2: `if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 :`
   - `num[0]` is `'2'`. `num[0][-1]` is `'2'`. `int('2')` is 2.
   - Condition `2 == 9` evaluates to False.
   - The branch is not taken. Annotation: `taken=['N']`.
3. Line 4: `else :`
   - Since the condition on line 2 was False, execution enters the `else` block.
   - The branch is taken. Annotation: `taken=['Y']`.
4. Line 5: `if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 :`
   - `num[1]` is `'4'`. `num[1][0]` is `'4'`. `int('4')` is 4.
   - Condition `4 >= 5` evaluates to False.
   - The branch is not taken. Annotation: `taken=['N']`.
5. Line 7: `else :`
   - Since the condition on line 5 was False, execution enters this `else` block.
   - The branch is taken. Annotation: `taken=['Y']`.
6. Line 8: `print ( num [ 0 ] )` prints "2".

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
