[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `array=[1]` and `index=0`.

1.  **Line 2:** `if index < 0:`
    *   The value of `index` is `0`.
    *   The condition `0 < 0` evaluated to `False`.
    *   Therefore, the branch at line 2 is **not taken** ('N').

The execution proceeds directly to line 4, returning `array[0]`.
The branch at line 2 is encountered once.
Result: `['N']`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
