[THOUGHT]
The input is `9`.

1.  **Line 1:** `n = int(input())` sets `n = 9`.
2.  **Line 2:** `while n % 2 == 0 :` checks if `9` is divisible by 2. `9 % 2` is `1`, so the condition is `False`. The loop body is not executed.
3.  **Line 4:** `if n == 1 :` checks if `n` (which is `9`) equals `1`. `9 == 1` is `False`. The branch is **not taken**.
    *   Annotation for line 4: `taken=['N']`
4.  **Line 6:** `else :` Since the `if` condition at line 4 was `False`, the `else` block is executed. This branch is **taken**.
    *   Annotation for line 6: `taken=['Y']`
5.  **Line 7:** `print('NO')` is executed.

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
