[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the `heal` method of the `RPGCharacter` class.

1.  **Initialize State**:
    The input object `self` has `hp = 100`.

2.  **Execute `heal`**:
    *   Line 14: `self.hp += 10`.
        `self.hp` becomes $100 + 10 = 110$.
    *   Line 15: `if (self.hp > 100):`
        Check condition: $110 > 100$. This is **True**.
        Therefore, the branch is taken ('Y').
    *   Line 16: `self.hp = 100`. (State update, hp is capped at 100).
    *   Line 17: `return self.hp` (Returns 100).

3.  **Annotate**:
    *   Line 15: `[BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]` start.
