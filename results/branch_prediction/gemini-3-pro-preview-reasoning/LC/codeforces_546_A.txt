[THOUGHT]
The input is `1 1 1`, which corresponds to `k=1`, `n=1`, `w=1`.
Line 1: `k`, `n`, `w` take values 1, 1, 1 respectively.
Line 2: `sum` is initialized to 0.
Line 3: `for i in range(1, w + 1)` means `range(1, 2)`, so `i` takes the value 1.
    Line 4: `sum += k * i` -> `sum += 1 * 1` -> `sum` becomes 1.
Line 3: Loop finishes.
Line 5: `if sum <= n:` checks `1 <= 1`, which is True.
Therefore, the branch at line 5 is taken ('Y').

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
9 
10
