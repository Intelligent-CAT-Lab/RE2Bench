[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the `add_book` method of the `BookManagement` class with specific inputs.

**Input Analysis:**
- `self.inventory`: `{"book1": 2, "book2": 1}`
- `title`: `"book2"`
- `quantity`: Not provided in `args` or `kwargs`, so it defaults to `1`.

**Execution Trace:**
1. **Line 8**: Method `add_book` is called with `title="book2"`.
2. **Line 9**: Check condition `if (title in self.inventory):`.
   - `self.inventory` keys are `["book1", "book2"]`.
   - `"book2"` is in `self.inventory`.
   - Condition evaluates to `True`.
   - Branch at Line 9 is taken. Marker becomes `['Y']`.
3. **Line 10**: `self.inventory[title] += quantity` is executed. `self.inventory["book2"]` becomes `2`.
4. **Line 11**: `else:` block.
   - Since the `if` condition was true, the `else` block is skipped.
   - Branch at Line 11 is not taken. Marker becomes `['N']`.

**Conclusion:**
- Line 9: `['Y']`
- Line 11: `['N']`
