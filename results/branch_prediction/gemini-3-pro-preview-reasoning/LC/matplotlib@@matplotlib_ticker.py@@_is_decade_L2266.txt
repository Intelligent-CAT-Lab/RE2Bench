[THOUGHT]
The input is `x=1e-07`, `base=10`, `rtol=1e-07`.

1.  **Line 4**: `if not np.isfinite(x):`
    *   `x` is `1e-07`, which is finite. `np.isfinite(x)` is `True`. `not ...` is `False`.
    *   Branch outcome: Not taken ('N').

2.  **Line 6**: `if x == 0.0:`
    *   `x` is `1e-07`, which is not `0.0`.
    *   Branch outcome: Not taken ('N').

3.  **Line 8**: `lx = np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)` is calculated. `log10(1e-7)` is `-7.0`.

4.  **Line 9**: `if rtol is None:`
    *   `rtol` is provided as `1e-07` in the input, so it is not `None`.
    *   Branch outcome: Not taken ('N').

5.  **Line 11**: `else:`
    *   Since the `if` at Line 9 resulted in `False`, the execution enters the `else` block.
    *   Branch outcome: Taken ('Y').
