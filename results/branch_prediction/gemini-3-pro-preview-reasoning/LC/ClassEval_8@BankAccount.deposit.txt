[THOUGHT]
The user wants to trace the `deposit` method of the `BankAccount` class with `amount` set to 300.

1. **State Initialization**: The `BankAccount` object is initialized with `balance` = 0. The method `deposit` is called with `amount` = 300.
2. **Line 9**: The code checks `if (amount < 0):`.
   - The value of `amount` is 300.
   - The condition `300 < 0` evaluates to `False`.
   - Therefore, the branch is **not taken**. The annotation should be `['N']`.
3. **Line 11**: `self.balance` becomes `0 + 300 = 300`.
4. **Line 12**: The method returns 300.

Conclusion: Only one branch point exists, and it evaluates to False (Not Taken).
