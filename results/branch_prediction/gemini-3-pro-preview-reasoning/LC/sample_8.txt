[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with arguments `string="UppEr"` and `encryption=0`.

Tracing the execution:
1.  **Line 2:** The condition `if encryption == 0:` is evaluated.
    *   Since `encryption` is `0`, `encryption == 0` evaluates to `True`.
    *   The branch is **taken**.
    *   We append `'Y'` to the list for this branch. Current list for Line 2: `['Y']`.
2.  **Line 3:** The statement `return string` is executed. The function returns `"UppEr"` and execution terminates.
3.  **Line 4:** The `else:` statement is never reached because the function returned at Line 3.
    *   Since this line is not encountered during execution, no entries are added to its branch prediction list.
    *   The list for Line 4 is `[]`.

Final Branch Annotations:
*   Line 2: `['Y']`
*   Line 4: `[]`

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
