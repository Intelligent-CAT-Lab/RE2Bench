[THOUGHT]
We call change_order_status with order_id = 1 (int). self.orders has a single key "1" (string). In Python, 1 (int) is not equal to "1" (str), so "1" in dict keys is different from 1. Therefore the condition (order_id in self.orders) is False -> first branch not taken ('N'), and the else branch is taken ('Y').
