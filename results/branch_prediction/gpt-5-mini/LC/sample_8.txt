[THOUGHT]
encryption == 0 evaluates to True (encryption is 0), so the 'if' branch is taken once ('Y'). The 'else' branch is not executed, so it's not taken ('N').
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
