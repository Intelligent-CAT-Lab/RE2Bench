[THOUGHT]
Input "1 1000000000" gives a = 1, b = 1000000000.
Line 2: condition a <= 0 and 0 <= b -> 1 <= 0 is False, so the 'if' is not taken.
Line 4 (elif): condition a < 0 and ... -> 1 < 0 is False, so the 'elif' is not taken.
Since neither 'if' nor 'elif' are taken, the 'else' is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 if a <= 0 and 0 <= b : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "Zero" )
4 elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( "Negative" )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( "Positive" )
