[THOUGHT]
The code checks membership in several collections in order. The input feature is "freetype2". This is typically a feature name (not a module name), so it's unlikely to be found in the 'modules' collection. Therefore the first if (feature in modules) will not be taken (evaluates False) and execution continues to the next checks.
