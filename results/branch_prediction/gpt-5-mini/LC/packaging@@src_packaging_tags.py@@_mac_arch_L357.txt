[THOUGHT]
Evaluate the first if: "if not is_32bit". Given is_32bit = True, not is_32bit is False, so that branch is not taken -> ['N'].
Then execution continues to the next conditional: "if arch.startswith('ppc')". arch = "x86_64", which does not start with "ppc", so that branch is not taken -> ['N'].

1 def _mac_arch(arch: str, is_32bit: bool = _32_BIT_INTERPRETER) -> str:
2     if not is_32bit: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         return arch
4 
5     if arch.startswith("ppc"): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         return "ppc"
7 
8     return "i386"
