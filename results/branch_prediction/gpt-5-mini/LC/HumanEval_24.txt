[THOUGHT]
range(3) -> 0,1,2; reversed(range(3)) iterates 2,1,0.
Iteration 1: i=2 -> 3 % 2 == 1 -> condition false -> branch not taken ('N').
Iteration 2: i=1 -> 3 % 1 == 0 -> condition true -> branch taken ('Y') and function returns 1, so i=0 is never reached.
Therefore the sequence of branch outcomes is ['N', 'Y'].
