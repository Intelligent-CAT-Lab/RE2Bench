[THOUGHT]
x = 1e-07 is finite, so "if not np.isfinite(x)" is False -> ['N'].
x != 0.0, so "if x == 0.0" is False -> ['N'].
rtol is provided (1e-07), so "if rtol is None" is False -> ['N'] and the else branch is taken -> ['Y'].
(For completeness: lx = log(1e-7)/log(10) = -7, so the final np.isclose check will be True, but that doesn't affect the branch-taking annotations.)

8     lx = np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)
9     if rtol is None: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N][/BRANCH]

11     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y][/BRANCH]
