[THOUGHT]
n = 1.
Line 3: n%2 == 1 is True (1%2 == 1) → the "if" branch is taken once.
Line 5 (the else corresponding to that if) is not taken.
The for loop runs for x in range(1, 2) → x = 1 only.
Line 8: x%2 == 0 is False for x=1 → the "if" branch at line 8 is not taken.
Line 10 (the else corresponding to that if) is taken once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4         p+='sn'
5     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):
8         if x%2 == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
9             p+='to'
10         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
