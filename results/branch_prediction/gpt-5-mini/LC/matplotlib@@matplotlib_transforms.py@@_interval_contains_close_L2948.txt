[THOUGHT]
Unpack interval: a = 0., b = 2.0. Check a > b → 0.0 > 2.0 is False, so the branch is not taken. The function then computes rtol and returns the range check (which would be True for the given val), but only the branch outcome for the if is required.

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
