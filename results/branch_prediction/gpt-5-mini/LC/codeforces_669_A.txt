[THOUGHT]
n = 999,999,994. Compute n % 3:
999,999,999 is divisible by 3, so 999,999,994 = 999,999,999 - 5 => modulo 3 = -5 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Therefore n % 3 == 0 is False, so the first if is not taken.
Since the first if is False, the elif n < 3 is evaluated; n is large (>>3), so n < 3 is False as well, so the elif branch is not taken.
Each branch point is encountered once, both not taken.
