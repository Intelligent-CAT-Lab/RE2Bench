[THOUGHT]
The input string is "a j c n x X k". Iterating character by character (including spaces) yields:
'a', ' ', 'j', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'n', ' ', 'x', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'k'.
For each character we evaluate char.isupper():
- For 'a', space, 'j', space, 'c', space, 'n', space, 'x', space -> isupper() is False -> branch not taken ('N').
- For 'X' -> isupper() is True -> branch taken ('Y'), and the function returns False immediately, so iteration stops there.
Thus the branch is evaluated 11 times (up to and including 'X') with outcomes N for the first 10 and Y for the 11th.

1 def f(input):
2     for char in input:
3         if char.isupper(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
