[THOUGHT]
We call get_gpa with name="Charlie". Check (name in self.students): "Charlie" is a key in students => True. Then check self.students[name]['courses']: this is a non-empty dict for Charlie, which is truthy => True. Therefore the if condition is True (taken 'Y') and the else branch is not taken ('N').
