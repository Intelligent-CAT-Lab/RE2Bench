[THOUGHT]
n = 1259. The first if (n == 1) is false, so that branch is not taken once -> ['N'].
The for loop runs for i in range(2, 1259), i.e., i = 2..1258 inclusive, which is 1257 iterations. 1259 is a prime (no divisors up to floor(sqrt(1259)) ), so n % i == 0 is false every iteration. Therefore the branch at line 7 is encountered 1257 times and is never taken -> a list of 1257 'N's. The loop's else executes and returns x.
