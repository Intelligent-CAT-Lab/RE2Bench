[THOUGHT]
Input n = 9. The while condition (n % 2 == 0) is false for 9, so the loop body is not executed at all. n remains 9. The if condition (n == 1) is false, so the if branch is not taken and the else branch is taken.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
8 
9
