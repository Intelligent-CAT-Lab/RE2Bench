[THOUGHT]
The interval unpacks to a = -107.73502692 and b = -7.73502692. The condition `a > b` compares -107.735... > -7.735..., which is False, so the branch is not taken. The subsequent return evaluates a <= val <= b as -107.735... <= -80.0 <= -7.735..., which is True, but that does not affect the branch outcome.

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
