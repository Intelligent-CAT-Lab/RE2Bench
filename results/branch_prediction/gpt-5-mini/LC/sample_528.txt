[THOUGHT]
s = "papeluchis". Loop builds c sequentially:
- First iteration i='p', c='p'. s.rfind('p') == 2 which is > -1, so the if condition is True and the function returns immediately.
The branch at line 6 is evaluated once and taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s):
2     b = ''
3     c = ''
4     for i in s:
5         c = c + i
6         if s.rfind(c) > -1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7             return s.rfind(c)
8     return 0
