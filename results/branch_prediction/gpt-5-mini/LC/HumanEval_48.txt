[THOUGHT]
text = "xywzx", len = 5, loop i runs 0..4 but will return early on mismatch.
i=0: compare text[0] ('x') with text[4] ('x') → equal → condition ( != ) is False → branch not taken.
i=1: compare text[1] ('y') with text[3] ('z') → not equal → condition is True → branch taken and function returns False immediately.
No further iterations occur.
Therefore branch outcomes: ['N','Y'] corresponding to i=0 and i=1.
