[THOUGHT]
Call select with fields omitted (so fields is None) and condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".
- Evaluate if (fields is None): True, so the first branch is taken -> 'Y'.
- The else corresponding to that if is not taken -> 'N'.
- Evaluate if (condition is not None): condition is a non-empty string, so True -> 'Y'.
Each branch point is encountered exactly once.
