[THOUGHT]
a = [0]. len(a) = 1, so len(a) >= 2 is False. The "and" expression short-circuits, so the overall if condition is False and the branch is not taken. The if is evaluated once, yielding N.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(a):
2     if len(a) >= 2 and a[0] > 0 and a[1] > 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         a.reverse()
4         return a
5     a.append(0)
6     return a
[/ANSWER]
