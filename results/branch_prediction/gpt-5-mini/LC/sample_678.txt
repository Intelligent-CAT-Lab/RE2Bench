[THOUGHT]
text = "HI" -> text.lower() = "hi". Loop iterates over 'h' then 'i'.
Initial freq = {}.
Iteration 1: c = 'h'. 'h' not in freq -> if at line 4 is False (N), so else at line 6 is taken (Y). freq becomes {'h':1}.
Iteration 2: c = 'i'. 'i' not in freq -> if at line 4 is False (N), else at line 6 taken (Y). freq becomes {'h':1,'i':1}.
So line 4 outcomes: [N, N]; line 6 outcomes: [Y, Y].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     freq = dict()
3     for c in text.lower():
4         if c in freq: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N][/BRANCH]
5             freq[c] += 1
6         else:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y][/BRANCH]
7             freq[c] = 1
8     return freq
