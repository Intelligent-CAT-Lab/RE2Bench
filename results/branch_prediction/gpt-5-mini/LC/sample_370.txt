[THOUGHT]
The string is "     i" (five spaces then 'i'). Loop iterates over 6 characters.
For each space: char.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken (N).
For 'i': char.isspace() is False → not False is True → branch taken (Y).
So the sequence is [N, N, N, N, N, Y].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     for char in text:
3         if not char.isspace(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
