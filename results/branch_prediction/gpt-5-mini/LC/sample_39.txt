[THOUGHT]
The function checks "if elem in array" once. array = [6, 2, 7, 1], elem = 6. Since 6 is present in the array, the condition is True, so the branch is taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
