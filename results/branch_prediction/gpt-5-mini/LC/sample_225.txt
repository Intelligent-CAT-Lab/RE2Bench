[THOUGHT]
text = "54882". The str.islower() method returns True only if there is at least one cased character and all cased characters are lowercase. The string consists only of digits (no cased characters), so text.islower() is False. Therefore the if branch is not taken.

1 def f(text):
2     if text.islower(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return True
4     return False
