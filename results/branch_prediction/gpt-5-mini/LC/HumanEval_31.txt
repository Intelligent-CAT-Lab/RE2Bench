n = 13441. 
Check line 5: n < 2? -> 13441 < 2 is False, so that branch is not taken -> 'N'.

The loop at line 7 iterates k in range(2, 13440) → k = 2..13439 inclusive. Number of iterations = 13440 - 2 = 13438.
We need to know whether any k divides 13441. The integer sqrt(13441) ≈ 115.99, so we only need to consider potential divisors ≤ 115. Checking primes up to 113 (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,101,103,107,109,113) none divide 13441 (quick modular checks show nonzero remainders). Therefore 13441 is prime, so for every k in the loop n % k == 0 is False and the branch at line 8 is never taken. Thus the line 8 branch outcomes are 'N' for each of the 13438 iterations.
