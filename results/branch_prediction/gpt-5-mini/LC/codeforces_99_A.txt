[THOUGHT]
input() returns the string " 2.4" (note the leading space). Splitting on "." gives num = [" 2", "4"].
- num[0] is " 2", so num[0][-1] is '2'. int('2') == 9 is False → the first if is not taken.
- Therefore the else (line 4) is taken.
- Inside the else: num[1] is "4", num[1][0] is '4'. int('4') >= 5 is False → the inner if is not taken, so its else (line 7) is taken.
Each branch point is encountered once, so the taken lists are single-element entries.

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
