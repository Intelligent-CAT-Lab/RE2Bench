[THOUGHT]
We count occurrences: ints = [2,3,5,2,4,5,2,89].
counts[2] becomes 3, counts[5] becomes 2, others less than 3.
The loop at line 8 iterates i = 0..300 (301 iterations). The condition counts[i] >= 3 is True only for i == 2. Therefore for each iteration we record 'Y' when i == 2, otherwise 'N'. That yields a list of 301 entries with 'Y' at index 2 and 'N' everywhere else.
