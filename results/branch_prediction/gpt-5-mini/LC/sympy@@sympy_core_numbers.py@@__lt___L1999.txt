[THOUGHT]
_other_ is passed as "1" and the code calls other = _sympify(other). This conversion succeeds (no SympifyError) and yields an Integer-like object whose attribute is_Integer is True. Therefore the condition if other.is_Integer is true and the branch is taken once.

1 from .sympify import (SympifyError, _sympy_converter, sympify, _convert_numpy_types,
2               _sympify, _is_numpy_instance)

4 class Integer(Rational):
5     q = 1
6     is_integer = True
7     is_number = True
8     is_Integer = True
9     __slots__ = ()

13             other = _sympify(other)
14         except SympifyError:
15             return NotImplemented
16         if other.is_Integer: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
17             return _sympify(self.p < other.p)
18         return Rational.__lt__(self, other)
