[THOUGHT]
We are asked to determine branch outcomes during the provided execution of splitx. The only branch marker in the snippet is inside the static method _check: the isinstance(points, np.ma.MaskedArray) test.

During the given call to splitx, there is no call to _check anywhere in the shown code path. splitx accesses self.extents, which calls get_points(); get_points is NotImplementedError in the base class, but in real use the instance would be a Bbox subclass providing get_points. Regardless, nothing in splitx calls _check, so the branch at line 11 is not evaluated at all during this execution. Therefore the branch point is encountered 0 times and the taken list is empty.

(If _check had been called, the provided _points appear to be a plain numpy array representation, not a numpy.ma.MaskedArray, so the branch would be 'N'. But since _check is not invoked here, we record no outcomes.)
