[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `change_order_status(order_id=1, status="Delivered")` with the given state:

1. `self.orders = {"1": {"product_id": 1, "quantity": 5, "status": "Delivered"}}`
2. `order_id = 1` (integer from args)

Now execute the method:
- Line 10: Check the condition `order_id in self.orders`
  - We're checking if the integer `1` is a key in the dictionary
  - The dictionary has the key `"1"` (a string), not the integer `1`
  - In Python, `1 in {"1": ...}` returns `False` because `1` (int) ≠ `"1"` (str)
  - The condition is False, so the if-branch is NOT taken → append 'N'
  
- Line 12: The else clause
  - Since the if condition was False, the else branch is executed
  - The else-branch IS taken → append 'Y'
  - The method returns False

Result:
- First branch (line 10): taken=['N']
- Second branch (line 12): taken=['Y']
