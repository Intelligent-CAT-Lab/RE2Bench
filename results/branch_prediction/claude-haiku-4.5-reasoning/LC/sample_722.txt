[THOUGHT]
The input text is ",wPzPppdl/" which has 10 characters.

Let me trace through each iteration of the loop:

i=0, text[0] = ',': ',' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=1, text[1] = 'w': 'w' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=2, text[2] = 'P': 'P' .isupper() is True → line 4 branch taken (Y), line 6 branch NOT taken (N)
i=3, text[3] = 'z': 'z' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=4, text[4] = 'P': 'P' .isupper() is True → line 4 branch taken (Y), line 6 branch NOT taken (N)
i=5, text[5] = 'p': 'p' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=6, text[6] = 'p': 'p' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=7, text[7] = 'd': 'd' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=8, text[8] = 'l': 'l' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)
i=9, text[9] = '/': '/' .isupper() is False → line 4 branch NOT taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y)

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     out = ""
3     for i in range(len(text)):
4         if text[i].isupper(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N][/BRANCH]
5             out += text[i].lower()
6         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y,N,Y,N,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y][/BRANCH]
7             out += text[i].upper()
8     return out
