[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step with input "2.4".

Line 1: `num = input().split(".")`
- `input()` gives us "2.4"
- `"2.4".split(".")` splits on the dot, giving us ["2", "4"]
- So `num = ["2", "4"]`

Line 2: `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
- `num[0]` is "2" (first element)
- `num[0][-1]` is the last character of "2", which is "2"
- `int("2")` is 2
- Is `2 == 9`? No, this is False
- The if condition is False, so branch NOT taken → N

Line 4: `else:`
- Since the if condition on line 2 was False, the else block executes
- The else branch IS taken → Y

Line 5: `if int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
- `num[1]` is "4" (second element)
- `num[1][0]` is the first character of "4", which is "4"
- `int("4")` is 4
- Is `4 >= 5`? No, this is False
- The if condition is False, so branch NOT taken → N

Line 7: `else:`
- Since the if condition on line 5 was False, the else block executes
- The else branch IS taken → Y

Line 8: `print(num[0])` prints "2"

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
