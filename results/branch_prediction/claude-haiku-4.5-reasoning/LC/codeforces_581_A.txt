[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input " 1 1":

Line 1: `x = list(input().split())`
- input() returns " 1 1"
- .split() gives ['1', '1']
- x = ['1', '1']

Lines 2-3: Loop through and convert to integers
- i=0: x[0] = int('1') = 1
- i=1: x[1] = int('1') = 1
- x = [1, 1]

Line 4: `a = x[0]` → a = 1
Line 5: `b = x[1]` → b = 1

Line 6: `print(min(x), end=" ")` → prints "1 " (min of [1, 1] is 1)

Line 7: `if abs(a - b) >= 2:`
- Evaluate: abs(1 - 1) = abs(0) = 0
- Check: 0 >= 2 is False
- The if condition is False, so this branch is NOT taken → 'N'

Line 9: `else:`
- Since the if condition was False, the else block executes → 'Y'

Line 10: `print(0)` → prints "0"

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
