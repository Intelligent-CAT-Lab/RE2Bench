[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input:
- string = "UppEr"
- encryption = 0

At line 2, we check the condition `if encryption == 0`:
- encryption is 0
- 0 == 0 evaluates to True
- The if branch is taken, so we execute line 3 and return "UppEr"
- The function returns immediately, so the else branch at line 4 is never reached

Therefore:
- Line 2 branch: condition is True → branch taken → 'Y'
- Line 4 branch: else is not executed because if was taken → branch not taken → 'N'
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
