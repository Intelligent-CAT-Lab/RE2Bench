[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input:

Input:
- array = [1]
- index = 0

Execution:
Line 1: Function definition with parameters array and index
- array = [1]
- index = 0

Line 2: `if index < 0:`
- Evaluate condition: is index < 0?
- index = 0, so 0 < 0 is False
- The branch is NOT taken

Line 3: `index = len(array) + index`
- This line is skipped since the branch was not taken

Line 4: `return array[index]`
- Return array[0] which is 1

The branch point at line 2 is encountered once during execution, and the condition is False, so the branch is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
