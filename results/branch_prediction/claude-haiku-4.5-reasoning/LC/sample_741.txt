[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of function f with the given inputs.

Input parameters:
- nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]
- p = 6

Execution:
1. Line 2: `prev_p = p - 1`
   - prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5

2. Line 3: `if prev_p < 0:`
   - Check condition: prev_p < 0
   - 5 < 0? False
   - The condition is False, so the branch is NOT taken
   - prev_p remains 5

3. Line 4: `return nums[prev_p]`
   - Return nums[5] = 1

The branch at line 3 is encountered once during execution. Since prev_p = 5 and 5 is NOT less than 0, the branch is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
[/ANSWER]
