[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input `text = ""`:

Line 1: `def f(text):` - function definition
Line 2: `texts = text.split()`
- `"".split()` returns an empty list `[]`
- So `texts = []`

Line 3: `if texts:` - check if texts is truthy
- `texts` is an empty list `[]`
- An empty list is falsy in Python
- The condition evaluates to `False`
- The branch is NOT taken

Line 6: `return 'nada'`
- Since the if condition was False, we skip the body and jump to line 6
- Return `'nada'`

The branch at line 3 is encountered once during execution and is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     texts = text.split()
3     if texts:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         xtexts = [t for t in texts if t.isascii() and t not in ('nada', '0')]
5         return max(xtexts, key=len) if xtexts else 'nada'
6     return 'nada'
