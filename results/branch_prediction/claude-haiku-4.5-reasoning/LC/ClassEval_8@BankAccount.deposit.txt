[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of deposit(amount=300) with self.balance=0:
* Check condition on line 9: `if (amount < 0)` with amount=300
* Is 300 < 0? No, this condition is False
* So this branch is not taken → append 'N'
* Execution continues to line 11 where balance is updated and line 12 where the new balance is returned
