[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_interval_contains_close` with the given input:

Given inputs:
- interval: array([0., 2.])
- val: array(0.)
- rtol: 1e-10

Line 2: `a, b = interval`
   Unpacking the interval array, we get:
   - a = 0.
   - b = 2.

Line 3: `if a > b:`
   Check if a > b:
   - a = 0., b = 2.
   - Is 0. > 2.? No, this is False
   - This branch is NOT taken → 'N'

The condition is false, so we skip line 4 and continue to line 5.

Line 5: `rtol = (b - a) * rtol`
   rtol = (2. - 0.) * 1e-10 = 2e-10

Line 6: `return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol`
   Returns the boolean result

The branch is encountered exactly once during execution and is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
