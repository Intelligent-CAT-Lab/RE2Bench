[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input.

Input: 1

Line 1: x = int(input())
- input() returns "1"
- int("1") converts this to the integer 1
- x = 1

Line 2: if x == 1:
- x is 1, so the condition x == 1 evaluates to True
- The if branch IS TAKEN → Y

Line 3: print(0)
- This executes and prints 0

Line 4: else:
- Since the if condition was True, the else branch is NOT TAKEN → N

Line 5: print(1)
- This does not execute because we took the if branch instead
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
