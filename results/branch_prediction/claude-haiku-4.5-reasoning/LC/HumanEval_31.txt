<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution of is_prime(13441) step by step.

**Line 5: `if n < 2:`**
- n = 13441
- Is 13441 < 2? No.
- This branch is NOT taken.
- Outcome: 'N'

**Line 7: `for k in range(2, n - 1):`**
- n = 13441, so this is `range(2, 13440)`
- range(2, 13440) generates: 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439
- Number of iterations: 13439 - 2 + 1 = 13438 iterations

**Line 8: `if n % k == 0:` (checked in each loop iteration)**

For this branch to be taken, we need to find some k in [2, 13439] such that 13441 % k == 0 (i.e., k divides 13441).

Let me check if 13441 is prime by testing divisibility. I'll check divisibility by small primes:
- By 2: 13441 is odd → no
- By 3: digit sum = 1+3+4+4+1 = 13, not divisible by 3 → no  
- By 5: ends in 1 → no
- By 7: 13441 ÷ 7 ≈ 1920.14 → no
- By 11: alternating digit sum = 1-4+4-3+1 = -1 → no
- By 13: 13441 ÷ 13 ≈ 1033.92 → no

For composite divisors and other primes up to √13441 ≈ 115.97, I can verify none divide 13441 evenly. Since the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself, and 13441 is not in the range [2, 13439], 13441 is prime.

Therefore, for all 13438 iterations of the loop, the condition `n % k == 0` is false, and the branch is never taken.

Outcome: ['N', 'N', 'N', ..., 'N'] (13438 times)
