[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input "20 30":

Line 1: `A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )`
- input() returns "20 30"
- split() gives ["20", "30"]
- map(int, ...) converts to integers
- A = 20, B = 30

Line 2: `ans = A - 2 * B`
- ans = 20 - 2 * 30
- ans = 20 - 60
- ans = -40

Line 3: `if ans < 0 :`
- Check if -40 < 0
- This is True, so the branch IS taken
- Append 'Y'

Line 4: `ans = 0`
- Executes because the branch was taken
- ans becomes 0

Line 5: `print ( ans )`
- Prints 0

The branch at line 3 is encountered once during execution and is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
6 
7
