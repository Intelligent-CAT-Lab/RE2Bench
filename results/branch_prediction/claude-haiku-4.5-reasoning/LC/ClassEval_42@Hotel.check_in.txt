[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `check_in` with the given input:

**Input parameters:**
- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}
- room_type = "single"
- room_number = 2
- name = "guest 1"

**Execution trace:**

Line 11: `if (room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()):`
- room_type = "single"
- self.booked_rooms.keys() = ['single']
- Is "single" NOT in ['single']? No, "single" IS in the keys.
- Condition evaluates to False → branch NOT taken → 'N'
- Continue to line 13 (don't execute line 12)

Line 13: `if (name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]):`
- name = "guest 1"
- self.booked_rooms[room_type] = self.booked_rooms["single"] = {}
- Is "guest 1" in {}? No, the dictionary is empty.
- Condition evaluates to False → branch NOT taken → 'N'
- Skip the entire if block (lines 14-19)

Lines 14, 16, 18: These branches are never reached/encountered because the parent if condition at line 13 was False. Therefore, none of these branch points are evaluated during execution.

**Summary:**
- Line 11: Encountered, not taken → taken=[N]
- Line 13: Encountered, not taken → taken=[N]
- Line 14: Not encountered → taken=[]
- Line 16: Not encountered → taken=[]
- Line 18: Not encountered → taken=[]
