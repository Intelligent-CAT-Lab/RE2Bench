[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with x = 1 and n = 1:

Line 4: if (n == 1):
- n = 1, so the condition n == 1 evaluates to True
- The branch is taken, so append 'Y'

Line 5: return (x == 1)
- x = 1, so x == 1 is True
- The function returns True immediately
- The while loop at line 7 is never executed

Since the function returns at line 5, there are no further iterations or branch checks.

The branch at line 4 is encountered once during execution and is taken.
