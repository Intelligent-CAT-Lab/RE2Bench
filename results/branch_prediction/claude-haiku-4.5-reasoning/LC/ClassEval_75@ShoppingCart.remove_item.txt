[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `remove_item` with the given input:

Method call: `remove_item(item="apple", quantity=1)` (quantity uses default value of 1)
State: `self.items = {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 4}}`

Line 9: `if (item in self.items):`
- Check if "apple" is in self.items
- self.items has key "apple"
- The condition is True, so this branch is taken → append 'Y'

Line 11: `else:`
- Since the if condition on line 9 evaluated to True, the else block is skipped
- This branch is not taken → append 'N'

The method continues to execute the body of the if statement (line 10), reducing the quantity.
