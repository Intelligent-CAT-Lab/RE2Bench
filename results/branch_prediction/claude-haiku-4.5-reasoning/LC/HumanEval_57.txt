[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the input `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`:

At line 5, we evaluate the condition:
```
if l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True):
```

First, let's compute:
- `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` = `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (ascending order)
- `l == sorted(l)` → `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]` → `True`

Since the first part of the `or` expression is `True`, the entire condition evaluates to `True` (Python short-circuits the evaluation).

The if-branch condition is `True`, so the branch is taken and the function returns `True` at line 6.

The branch is encountered exactly once during execution and is taken.
