[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input "1 1 1":

Line 1: `k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )`
- input() returns "1 1 1"
- After strip() and split(): ["1", "1", "1"]
- After map(int, ...): k = 1, n = 1, w = 1

Line 2: `sum = 0`
- sum is initialized to 0

Line 3-4: `for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :`
- range(1, w + 1) = range(1, 2)
- This produces one iteration with i = 1
- sum += k * i → sum += 1 * 1 → sum = 0 + 1 = 1

After loop exits, sum = 1

Line 5: `if sum <= n :`
- Evaluate: 1 <= 1
- This is True
- Branch is taken → append 'Y'

Line 6: `print ( 0 )` is executed

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )

10
