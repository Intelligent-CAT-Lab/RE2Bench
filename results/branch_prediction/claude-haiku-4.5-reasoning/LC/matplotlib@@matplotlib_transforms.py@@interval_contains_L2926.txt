[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `interval_contains`:

1. The function is called with:
   - `interval`: array([-107.73502692, -7.73502692])
   - `val`: -80.0

2. Line 2: `a, b = interval`
   - `a = -107.73502692`
   - `b = -7.73502692`

3. Line 3: `if a > b:`
   - We need to evaluate: `-107.73502692 > -7.73502692`?
   - Since -107.73502692 is more negative than -7.73502692, we have: -107.73502692 < -7.73502692
   - Therefore, the condition `a > b` is False
   - The branch is NOT taken

4. Line 5: `return a <= val <= b`
   - This executes without the swap
   - Returns -107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692, which evaluates to True
   
The branch at line 3 is not taken, so the answer is ['N'].

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
