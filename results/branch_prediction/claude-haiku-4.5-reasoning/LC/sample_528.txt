[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code with s = "papeluchis".

Initial state:
- b = ''
- c = ''

The loop iterates through each character in s.

**Iteration 1: i = 'p' (first character)**
- c = '' + 'p' = 'p'
- Check condition: s.rfind(c) > -1
  - s.rfind('p') finds the rightmost occurrence of 'p' in "papeluchis"
  - Looking at "papeluchis": 'p' appears at index 0 and index 2
  - rfind returns the rightmost index, which is 2
  - 2 > -1 is True
  - **Branch taken: Y**
  - The function executes `return s.rfind(c)` and returns 2

Since the function returns on the first iteration, the loop terminates and no further iterations occur.

The branch at line 6 is encountered exactly once during execution, and it is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s):
2     b = ''
3     c = ''
4     for i in s:
5         c = c + i
6         if s.rfind(c) > -1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7             return s.rfind(c)
8     return 0
