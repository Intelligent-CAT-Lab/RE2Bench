[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_gpa` with the given input:

The method is called with:
- `name` = "Charlie"
- `self.students` = a dictionary containing "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie"

On line 9, evaluating the condition:
```python
if ((name in self.students) and self.students[name]['courses']):
```

First part: `name in self.students`
- `name` = "Charlie"
- "Charlie" is a key in `self.students` → True

Second part: `self.students[name]['courses']`
- `self.students["Charlie"]` exists and contains: `{"name": "Charlie", "grade": 2, "major": "Chemistry", "courses": {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}}`
- `self.students["Charlie"]['courses']` = `{"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}` (a non-empty dictionary)
- A non-empty dictionary is truthy → True

Overall condition: `True and True` = True

Therefore:
- The if branch at line 9 is taken → append 'Y'
- The else branch at line 11 is not taken → append 'N'
