[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input:

Input:
- arr = [-4, 4]
- k = 2

Execution:
1. Function `maximum(arr, k)` is called with arr=[-4, 4] and k=2
2. Line 4: `if k == 0:`
   - k is 2, so k == 0 evaluates to False
   - The branch is NOT taken
3. Line 6: `arr.sort()` - arr is sorted to [-4, 4]
4. Line 7: `ans = arr[-k:]` where k=2, so arr[-2:] = [-4, 4]
5. Line 8: `return ans` - returns [-4, 4]

The branch at line 4 is encountered once and evaluates to False, so it's not taken.

2 def maximum(arr, k):
3 
4     if k == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return []
6     arr.sort()
7     ans = arr[-k:]
8     return ans
