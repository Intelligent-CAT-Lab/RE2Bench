[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with:
- `array`: [6, 2, 7, 1]
- `elem`: 6

At line 2, we evaluate the condition `if elem in array:`
- `elem = 6`
- `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]`
- `6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]` evaluates to True (6 is the first element)
- Since the condition is True, the branch is taken
- We execute line 3 and return `array.index(6)`, which is 0
- Line 4 is never reached

The branch point at line 2 is encountered once during execution and is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
