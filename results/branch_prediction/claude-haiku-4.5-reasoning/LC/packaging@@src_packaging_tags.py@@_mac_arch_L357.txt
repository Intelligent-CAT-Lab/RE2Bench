[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_mac_arch` with the given input:
- `arch = "x86_64"`
- `is_32bit = True`

Line 2: `if not is_32bit:`
- `is_32bit = True`
- `not True = False`
- The condition evaluates to False, so this branch is NOT taken
- First branch: taken=['N']

Since the first condition is False, we don't return and continue to line 5.

Line 5: `if arch.startswith("ppc"):`
- `arch = "x86_64"`
- `"x86_64".startswith("ppc")` returns False
- The condition evaluates to False, so this branch is NOT taken
- Second branch: taken=['N']

Since this condition is also False, we skip the return statement at line 6 and continue to line 8.

Line 8: `return "i386"`
- We return "i386"
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 def _mac_arch(arch: str, is_32bit: bool = _32_BIT_INTERPRETER) -> str:
2     if not is_32bit: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         return arch
4 
5     if arch.startswith("ppc"): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         return "ppc"
7 
8     return "i386"
