[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of heal() with the given input:

Initial state:
- self.hp = 100

Execution:
1. Line 14: `self.hp += 10` → self.hp becomes 100 + 10 = 110
2. Line 15: Check condition `if (self.hp > 100)` where self.hp = 110
   - Is 110 > 100? Yes, this condition is True, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'
3. Line 16: `self.hp = 100` (this line executes because the condition was true)
4. Line 17: `return self.hp` returns 100

Since self.hp became 110 after the increment, and 110 > 100 is True, the branch is taken.
