[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution with the given inputs:
- str = "fnuiyh"
- toget = "ni"

Line 2: `if str.startswith(toget):`
This checks if "fnuiyh".startswith("ni")
- "fnuiyh" starts with 'f', not 'ni'
- So str.startswith(toget) returns False
- The if condition is False, so the branch is NOT taken → N

Line 3: `else: return str`
Since the if condition was False, the else branch IS taken → Y

Each branch point is encountered once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
