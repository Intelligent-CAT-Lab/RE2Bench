[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given inputs:

items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]
target = "**"

At line 2, we evaluate: `if target in items:`

I need to check if "**" is in the items list:
- items[0] = "1" (not a match)
- items[1] = "+" (not a match)
- items[2] = "-" (not a match)
- items[3] = "**" (this matches!)

Since "**" is found in the items list at index 3, the condition `target in items` evaluates to True.

Therefore, the branch at line 2 is taken (Y), and the function executes line 3, returning 3.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
[/ANSWER]
