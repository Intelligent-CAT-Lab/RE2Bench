[THOUGHT]
The function `digitSum(s)` is called with `s = "You arE Very Smart"`.

At line 4, the condition checks if `s == ""`:
- `s = "You arE Very Smart"` (non-empty string)
- `s == ""` evaluates to `False`
- The branch condition is False, so the branch is NOT taken

The function proceeds to line 5 and returns the sum without exiting early.

Since there is only one branch point and it's encountered once (not taken), the result is:
`taken=['N']`
