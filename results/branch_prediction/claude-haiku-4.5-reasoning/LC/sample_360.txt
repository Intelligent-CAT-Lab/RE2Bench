[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given inputs:
- text = "g"
- n = 15

Line 2: `if len(text) <= 2:`
- `len("g")` equals 1
- `1 <= 2` is True
- The condition is True, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'

Since the branch is taken, line 3 executes `return text`, and the function returns immediately without executing lines 4 and 5.

The branch at line 2 is encountered once during execution and is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, n):
2     if len(text) <= 2: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return text
4     leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
5     return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
