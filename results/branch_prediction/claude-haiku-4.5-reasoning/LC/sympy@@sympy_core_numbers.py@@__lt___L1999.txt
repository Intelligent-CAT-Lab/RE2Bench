[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `__lt__` with the given input:

1. Initial state: `self` is an Integer instance with value 3, `other` is 1
2. Line 13: `other = _sympify(other)` where `other = 1`
   - `_sympify(1)` converts the value to a SymPy object
   - Since 1 is already a numeric type, it gets converted to a SymPy Integer (or compatible numeric type)
   - This succeeds without raising SympifyError, so we continue
3. Line 16: `if other.is_Integer:`
   - After `_sympify(1)`, `other` is a SymPy Integer
   - The Integer class definition (line 8) shows `is_Integer = True` as a class attribute
   - Therefore `other.is_Integer` evaluates to `True`
   - The branch IS taken → 'Y'

Since there's only one branch marker in this code and it's taken once, the answer is `['Y']`.

13             other = _sympify(other)
14         except SympifyError:
15             return NotImplemented
16         if other.is_Integer: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
17             return _sympify(self.p < other.p)
18         return Rational.__lt__(self, other)
