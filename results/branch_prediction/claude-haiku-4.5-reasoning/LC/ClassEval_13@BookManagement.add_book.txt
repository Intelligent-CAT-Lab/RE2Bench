[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `add_book` with the given input:

Initial state:
- self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}
- title = "book2"
- quantity = 1 (default value)

Execution:
1. Line 9: Check condition `(title in self.inventory)`
   - title = "book2"
   - self.inventory contains "book2" as a key
   - The condition is TRUE, so the if-branch is taken → append 'Y'
   
2. Line 10 executes:
   - self.inventory["book2"] += 1 (becomes 3)
   
3. Line 11 (else block):
   - Since the if condition was true, the else branch is NOT taken → append 'N'
