[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step with `var = " 99 777"`.

Line 2: `if var.isdigit():`
- `" 99 777".isdigit()` checks if all characters are digits. This string contains spaces, so it returns False.
- Branch NOT taken → N

Line 4: `elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():`
- This is only evaluated if line 2 is False (which it is).
- `" 99 777".replace('.', '', 1)` removes the first '.', but there is no '.', so result is `" 99 777"`
- `" 99 777".isdigit()` returns False (spaces make it not all digits)
- Branch NOT taken → N

Line 6: `elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1:`
- This is only evaluated if lines 2 and 4 are False (which they are).
- `" 99 777"` = [' ', '9', '9', ' ', '7', '7', '7'] has length 7
- `var.count(' ')` = 2 (two spaces)
- `len(var) - 1` = 6
- Is `2 == 6`? No, condition is False.
- Branch NOT taken → N

Line 8: `elif len(var) == 1:`
- This is only evaluated if lines 2, 4, and 6 are False (which they are).
- `len(var)` = 7
- Is `7 == 1`? No, condition is False.
- Branch NOT taken → N

Line 10: `else:`
- All previous conditions were False, so the else block executes.
- Branch IS taken → Y
