[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step with input 99:

Line 1: `N = int(input())` → N = 99

Line 2: `if N % 2 == 0:` 
- N = 99
- 99 % 2 = 1 (since 99 is odd)
- 1 == 0 evaluates to False
- The if condition is False, so this branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

Line 4: `else:`
- Since the if condition at line 2 was False, the else block is executed
- This branch IS taken → append 'Y'

Line 5: `print((N + 1) / N / 2)` is executed, which prints (100/99)/2 ≈ 0.5050...

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
