[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of level_up() with the given input:

Initial state:
- self.level = 3
- self.hp = 140
- self.attack_power = 30
- self.defense = 20
- self.exp = 0

Line 14: Check the condition `if (self.level < 100):`
- self.level = 3
- Is 3 < 100? Yes, this evaluates to True
- So this branch is taken → append 'Y'

The if block executes:
- self.level is incremented to 4
- self.exp is set to 0
- self.hp is incremented by 20 to 160
- self.attack_power is incremented by 5 to 35
- self.defense is incremented by 5 to 25

Line 20: The method returns the tuple (4, 160, 35, 25)
