Let me trace through the code with n = 1:

1. Line 2: p = ''

2. Line 3: Check if n%2 == 1
   - n = 1, so 1 % 2 = 1
   - 1 == 1 is True
   - The condition is true, so the if branch IS TAKEN: Y

3. Line 4: p += 'sn' (executed because if was true)
   - p = 'sn'

4. Line 5: The else clause
   - Since the if at line 3 was true, the else is NOT TAKEN: N

5. Line 7: for x in range(1, n+1)
   - n = 1, so range(1, 2) produces [1]
   - Loop iteration 1: x = 1

6. Line 8: Check if x%2 == 0
   - x = 1, so 1 % 2 = 1
   - 1 == 0 is False
   - The condition is false, so the if branch IS NOT TAKEN: N

7. Line 10: The else clause
   - Since the if at line 8 was false, the else IS TAKEN: Y

8. Line 11: p += 'ts'
   - p = 'snts'

9. Loop ends (range(1, 2) has only one element)

10. Line 12: return p

The branch outcomes are:
- Line 3 (if n%2 == 1): Y
- Line 5 (else): N
- Line 8 (if x%2 == 0): N
- Line 10 (else): Y
