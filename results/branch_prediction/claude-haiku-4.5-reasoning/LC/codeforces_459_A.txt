[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input "3 4 7 8".

Line 1: Parse the input
- anti, b, c, d = 3, 4, 7, 8

Line 2: Calculate l and m
- l = abs(3 - 7) = abs(-4) = 4
- m = abs(4 - 8) = abs(-4) = 4

Line 3: Check if anti == c
- anti = 3, c = 7
- 3 == 7 is False
- Branch is NOT taken → 'N'

Line 4: Check elif b == d
- Since the if on line 3 was false, we evaluate this elif
- b = 4, d = 8
- 4 == 8 is False
- Branch is NOT taken → 'N'

Line 5: Check elif l != m
- Since the elif on line 4 was false, we evaluate this elif
- l = 4, m = 4
- 4 != 4 is False
- Branch is NOT taken → 'N'

Line 6: The else clause executes (since all conditions above were false)
- prints: 3 8 7 4

[ANSWER]
1 anti , b , c , d = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 l = abs ( anti - c ) ; m = abs ( b - d )
3 if anti == c : print ( anti + m , b , c + m , d ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4 elif b == d : print ( anti , b + l , c , d + l ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5 elif l != m : print ( - 1 ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6 else : print ( anti , d , c , b )
7 
8
