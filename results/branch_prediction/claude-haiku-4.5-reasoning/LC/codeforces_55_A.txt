[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step with input 9.

Line 1: n = int(input()) → n = 9

Line 2-3: while n % 2 == 0:
- Check condition: 9 % 2 == 0? → 9 % 2 = 1, so 1 == 0 is False
- Loop condition is False, so the loop body is never executed

Line 4: if n == 1:
- At this point, n = 9 (unchanged since loop never executed)
- Check condition: 9 == 1? → This is False
- The if branch is NOT taken → N

Line 6: else:
- Since the if condition at line 4 was False, the else branch must be taken → Y
- print('NO') is executed

So:
- Line 4 (if): N
- Line 6 (else): Y

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )

9
