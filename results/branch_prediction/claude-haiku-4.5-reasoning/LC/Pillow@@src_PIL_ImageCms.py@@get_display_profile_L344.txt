[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_display_profile(handle=None)`:

Line 8: `if sys.platform != "win32":`
- The condition checks whether the current platform is NOT Windows
- Since no platform information is specified in the input and this is a typical testing scenario, the code is likely running on a non-Windows platform (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- Therefore, `sys.platform != "win32"` evaluates to True
- This means the branch IS taken → 'Y'
- Line 9 executes: `return None`
- The function exits early, and the rest of the code (lines 11-19) is never executed

So there is only one branch to predict (line 8), and it is taken.

6 def get_display_profile(handle: SupportsInt | None = None) -> ImageCmsProfile | None:

8     if sys.platform != "win32": ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
9         return None
10 
11     from . import ImageWin
12 
13     if isinstance(handle, ImageWin.HDC):
14         profile = core.get_display_profile_win32(int(handle), 1)
15     else:
16         profile = core.get_display_profile_win32(int(handle or 0))
17     if profile is None:
18         return None
19     return ImageCmsProfile(profile)
