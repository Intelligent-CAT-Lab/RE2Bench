[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input "7 5 5":

Line 2: Parse the input
- `input()` returns "7 5 5"
- `.split()` gives ["7", "5", "5"]
- `map(int, ...)` converts to integers
- `tuple(...)` creates ABC = (7, 5, 5)

Line 3: Evaluate the if condition
- `ABC.count(5)` counts occurrences of 5 in the tuple (7, 5, 5)
- The value 5 appears exactly 2 times
- So `ABC.count(5) == 2` evaluates to `2 == 2` which is True
- The if branch is TAKEN → 'Y'

Line 5: The else clause
- Since the if condition was True, the else clause is NOT executed
- The else branch is NOT TAKEN → 'N'

Note: Line 4 executes because the if was taken:
- `sum(ABC)` = 7 + 5 + 5 = 17
- 17 == 17 is True, so it prints 'YES'

[ANSWER]
1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
