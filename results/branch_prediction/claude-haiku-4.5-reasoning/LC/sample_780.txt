<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through this code step by step.

First, I'll analyze the input:
ints = [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]

**First loop (lines 4-5)** - Count occurrences:
- i=2: counts[2] += 1 → counts[2] = 1
- i=3: counts[3] += 1 → counts[3] = 1
- i=5: counts[5] += 1 → counts[5] = 1
- i=2: counts[2] += 1 → counts[2] = 2
- i=4: counts[4] += 1 → counts[4] = 1
- i=5: counts[5] += 1 → counts[5] = 2
- i=2: counts[2] += 1 → counts[2] = 3
- i=89: counts[89] += 1 → counts[89] = 1

After first loop:
- counts[2] = 3
- counts[3] = 1
- counts[4] = 1
- counts[5] = 2
- counts[89] = 1
- All other indices: 0

**Second loop (lines 8-10)** - Branch condition at line 9: `if counts[i] >= 3`

The loop iterates for i in range(len(counts)) = range(301), so i goes from 0 to 300:

- i=0: counts[0]=0, 0>=3? **NO** → N
- i=1: counts[1]=0, 0>=3? **NO** → N
- i=2: counts[2]=3, 3>=3? **YES** → Y
- i=3: counts[3]=1, 1>=3? **NO** → N
- i=4: counts[4]=1, 1>=3? **NO** → N
- i=5: counts[5]=2, 2>=3? **NO** → N
- i=6 through i=88: counts[i]=0, 0>=3? **NO** → N (83 times)
- i=89: counts[89]=1, 1>=3? **NO** → N
- i=90 through i=300: counts[i]=0, 0>=3? **NO** → N (211 times)

Summary:
- Branch taken once: when i=2
- Branch not taken: 300 times (for i=0,1,3,4,5,...,300)
- Total iterations: 301 (from 0 to 300 inclusive)

The sequence is: [N, N, Y, N, N, ..., N] where there are 298 N's after the Y (from i=3 to i=300).
Total elements: 2 + 1 + 298 = 301 ✓
