[THOUGHT]
x = int(input()) with input "1" gives x == 1 True.
At line 2 (if x == 1): condition is True, so branch is taken -> 'Y'.
The else at line 4 is not executed, so that branch is not taken -> 'N'.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
