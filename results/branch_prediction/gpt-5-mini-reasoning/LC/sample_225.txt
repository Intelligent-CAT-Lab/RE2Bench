[THOUGHT]
text = "54882". str.islower() returns True only if there's at least one cased character and all cased characters are lowercase. A string of only digits has no cased characters, so text.islower() is False. Therefore the if condition is not taken (N).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     if text.islower(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return True
4     return False
