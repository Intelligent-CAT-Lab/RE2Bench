[THOUGHT]
We call change_order_status(self, order_id=1, status="Delivered").
self.orders is a dict with a single key "1" (string). The membership test (order_id in self.orders) checks if the integer 1 is a key in the dict. The key is the string "1", which is not equal to the integer 1, so the test is False. Therefore the 'if' branch is not taken (append 'N') and the 'else' branch is taken (append 'Y').
