[THOUGHT]
Input is "1 1". After splitting and converting, x = [1, 1], a = 1, b = 1.
min(x) prints 1. abs(a - b) = 0, which is not >= 2, so the if condition is false (not taken) and the else branch is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
