[THOUGHT]
We only encounter the branch at line 5 once when calling check("freetype2"). There is no information suggesting "freetype2" is an element of the modules collection, so the condition feature in modules evaluates to False and the branch is not taken. Therefore the branch outcome list is ['N'] (single occurrence -> N).

1 import warnings
2 
3 def check(feature):
4 
5     if feature in modules: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         return check_module(feature)
7     if feature in codecs:
8         return check_codec(feature)
9     if feature in features:
10         return check_feature(feature)
11     warnings.warn(f"Unknown feature '{feature}'.", stacklevel=2)
12     return False
13
