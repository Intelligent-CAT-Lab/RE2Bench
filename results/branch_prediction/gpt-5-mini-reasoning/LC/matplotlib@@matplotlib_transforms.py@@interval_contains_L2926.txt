[THOUGHT]
The interval elements are a = -107.73502692 and b = -7.73502692. The condition a > b evaluates to -107.735... > -7.735... which is false, so the branch body is not executed. Therefore the branch is not taken: ['N'].

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
