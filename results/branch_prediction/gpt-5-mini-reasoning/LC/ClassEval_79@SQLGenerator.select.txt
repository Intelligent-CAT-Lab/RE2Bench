Call select with no positional args and kwargs contains condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20". Therefore:
- fields parameter uses its default value None. The condition (fields is None) is True -> first branch taken 'Y'.
- The else branch for fields is not executed -> 'N'.
- condition is not None (it's a non-empty string) -> that if is taken 'Y'.
Each branch point is encountered once, so each list has a single element.
