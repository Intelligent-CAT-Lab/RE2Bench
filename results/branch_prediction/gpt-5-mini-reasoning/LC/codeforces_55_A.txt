[THOUGHT]
Input is " 9", so n = 9. The while condition n % 2 == 0 is false (9 % 2 == 1), so the loop body is not executed at all. After the loop n remains 9, so the if n == 1 check is false (branch not taken) and the else branch is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
8 
9
