[THOUGHT]
Input parsed: a = 1, b = 1000000000.

Line 2 condition: a <= 0 and 0 <= b -> 1 <= 0 is False, so the whole 'and' is False -> if not taken (N).

Line 4 condition (elif): a < 0 and ... -> 1 < 0 is False, so the 'and' is False -> elif not taken (N).

Since neither if nor elif taken, the else is executed -> else taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 if a <= 0 and 0 <= b : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "Zero" )
4 elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( "Negative" )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( "Positive" )
