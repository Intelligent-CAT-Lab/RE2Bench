[THOUGHT]
Given n = 185 and m = 546. The condition "if m < n" checks 546 < 185, which is False, so the branch body (return -1) is not executed. The branch is encountered once, and its outcome is 'N'.

4     if m < n: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return -1
6     summation = 0
7     for i in range(n, m+1):
8         summation += i
9     return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
