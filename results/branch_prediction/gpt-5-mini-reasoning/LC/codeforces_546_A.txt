[THOUGHT]
k, n, w = 1, 1, 1. The loop runs i = 1 only, so sum = 1*1 = 1. The condition sum <= n is 1 <= 1 which is True, so the branch at line 5 is taken once: 'Y'.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
9 
10
