[THOUGHT]
The input text is "     i" (five spaces followed by 'i'), so the loop iterates 6 times.
For each space character, char.isspace() is True, so not char.isspace() is False → branch not taken ('N') for the first 5 iterations.
For the final character 'i', char.isspace() is False, so not False is True → branch taken ('Y') and the function returns.
Thus the branch outcomes are [N, N, N, N, N, Y].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     for char in text:
3         if not char.isspace(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
