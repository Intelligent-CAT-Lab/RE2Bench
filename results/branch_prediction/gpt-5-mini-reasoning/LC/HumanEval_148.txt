[THOUGHT]
planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth".
Check the condition: (planet1 not in planet_names) is False because "Earth" is in planet_names.
(planet2 not in planet_names) is False for the same reason.
(planet1 == planet2) is True because both are "Earth".
The overall OR expression False or False or True -> True, so the if-condition is taken exactly once.
