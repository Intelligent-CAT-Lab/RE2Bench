[THOUGHT]
index = 0. The condition "index < 0" is False, so the if-branch is not taken. The code inside the if is skipped and index remains 0. Therefore the single branch occurrence is 'N'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
