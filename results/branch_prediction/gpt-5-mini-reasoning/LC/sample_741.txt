[THOUGHT]
p = 6 so prev_p = p - 1 = 5. The condition checks if prev_p < 0, i.e., 5 < 0, which is False. Therefore the single conditional is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
[/ANSWER]
