[THOUGHT]
We call _mac_arch with arch="x86_64" and is_32bit=True.
- The first condition is "if not is_32bit": not True is False, so that branch is not taken -> 'N'.
- Execution continues to the next if.
- The second condition is "if arch.startswith('ppc')": "x86_64" does not start with "ppc", so that branch is not taken -> 'N'.
Each branch point is encountered once, so both get ['N'].

1 def _mac_arch(arch: str, is_32bit: bool = _32_BIT_INTERPRETER) -> str:
2     if not is_32bit: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return arch
4 
5     if arch.startswith("ppc"): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         return "ppc"
7 
8     return "i386"
