[THOUGHT]
We call check_in with room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1".
- Line 11: (room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()) -> "single" is a key in booked_rooms, so condition is False -> append 'N'.
- Line 13: (name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]) -> self.booked_rooms["single"] is {}, so "guest 1" is not present, condition is False -> append 'N'.
- The nested branches on lines 14, 16, 18 are inside the previous if-block, which was not entered, so those branch points are not encountered at all -> empty lists [] for each.
