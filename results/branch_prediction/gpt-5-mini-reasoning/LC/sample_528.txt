[THOUGHT]
s = "papeluchis". Loop builds c sequentially:
- 1st iteration: c = 'p'. s.rfind('p') == 2 (> -1) so the condition is True and the function returns immediately.
No further iterations occur.
Therefore the branch at line 6 is encountered once and is taken: ['Y'].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(s):
2     b = ''
3     c = ''
4     for i in s:
5         c = c + i
6         if s.rfind(c) > -1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
7             return s.rfind(c)
8     return 0
