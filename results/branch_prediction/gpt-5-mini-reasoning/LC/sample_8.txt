[THOUGHT]
encryption == 0 is True for the input (encryption is 0), so the if branch is taken once ('Y'). The else branch is not executed, so it is not taken ('N').
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
