[THOUGHT]
The interval is array([0., 2.]) so unpacking gives a = 0.0 and b = 2.0. The condition a > b is False (0.0 > 2.0 is false), so the swap branch is not taken. There's only one encounter of this branch.

1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
