[THOUGHT]
pref is the string "W", not a list.
At line 2: isinstance(pref, list) is False, so the "if" branch is not taken -> 'N'.
Therefore execution goes to the else at line 4, which is taken -> 'Y'.
Each branch point is encountered once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, pref):
2     if isinstance(pref, list): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return ', '.join(text.startswith(x) for x in pref)
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5         return text.startswith(pref)
