[THOUGHT]
text = "wrazugizoernmgzu" (length 16). The loop iterates i from 0 to 14, but the if is checked at i=0 first. text[0:] is the whole string, which consists entirely of lowercase letters, so text[0:].islower() is True. The if is taken on the first encounter, then the function returns immediately, so the branch is encountered exactly once and is 'Y'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     for i in range(len(text)-1):
3         if text[i:].islower(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4             return text[i + 1:]
5     return ''
