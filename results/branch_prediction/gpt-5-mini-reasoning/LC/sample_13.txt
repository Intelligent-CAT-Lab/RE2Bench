[THOUGHT]
We iterate over names:
- i = "sharron": all letters, i.isalpha() is True → branch taken 'Y'
- i = "Savannah": all letters, i.isalpha() is True → branch taken 'Y'
- i = "Mike Cherokee": contains a space, i.isalpha() is False → branch not taken 'N'
So the sequence of branch outcomes is [Y, Y, N].

1 def f(names):
2     count = len(names)
3     numberOfNames = 0
4     for i in names:
5         if i.isalpha(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y,N][/BRANCH]
6             numberOfNames += 1
7     return numberOfNames
