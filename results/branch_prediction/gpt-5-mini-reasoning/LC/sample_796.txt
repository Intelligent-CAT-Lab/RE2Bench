[THOUGHT]
We check if "fnuiyh".startswith("ni").
"fnuiyh" begins with "fn", not "ni", so the condition is False.
Therefore the if branch is not taken (N) and the else branch is taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
