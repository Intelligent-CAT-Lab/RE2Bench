[THOUGHT]
The method calls _sympify(other) with other = "1". _sympify will convert the string "1" to an Integer object (or equivalent SymPy Integer), which has the attribute is_Integer set to True. Therefore the condition `if other.is_Integer:` is true and the branch is taken once. So the branch outcomes list is ['Y'].
