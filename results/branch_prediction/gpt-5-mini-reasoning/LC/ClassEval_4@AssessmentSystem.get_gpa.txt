[THOUGHT]
We call get_gpa(self, name="Charlie").
- Check (name in self.students): "Charlie" is a key in students -> True.
- Check self.students[name]['courses']: Charlie's courses is a non-empty dict -> True.
- Combined with and -> overall condition is True, so the if-branch is taken ('Y') and the else-branch is not taken ('N').
