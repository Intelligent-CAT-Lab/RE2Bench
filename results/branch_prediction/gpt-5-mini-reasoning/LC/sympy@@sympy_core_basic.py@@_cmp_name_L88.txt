[THOUGHT]
We execute _cmp_name with x.__name__ = "ImaginaryUnit" and y.__name__ = "Pi".

1) Check if n1 == n2: "ImaginaryUnit" != "Pi", so the equality branch is not taken -> ['N'].

2) Check if not issubclass(y, Basic): Pi is a SymPy number class and is a subclass of Basic, so issubclass(y, Basic) is True, making the condition False. Thus the "if not issubclass..." branch is not taken -> ['N'].

3) The code looks up both names in ordering_of_classes; if a name is not present it sets its index to UNKNOWN. It's reasonable here that neither "ImaginaryUnit" nor "Pi" is in ordering_of_classes, so i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN evaluates True, so that branch is taken -> ['Y'].
