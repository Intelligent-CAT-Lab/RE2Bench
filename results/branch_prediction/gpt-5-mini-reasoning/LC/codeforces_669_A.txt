[THOUGHT]
n = 999,999,994.
Compute n % 3: 999,999,999 is divisible by 3, so 999,999,994 = 999,999,999 - 5 gives remainder 1. Therefore n % 3 == 0 is False -> branch at line 9 not taken.
Then check n < 3: 999,999,994 < 3 is False -> branch at line 11 not taken.
So both conditionals are not taken and the else branch runs.
