n = 13441.
Check "if n < 2": 13441 < 2 is False → that branch is not taken once.
The loop runs for k in range(2, n - 1) → k = 2 .. 13439 inclusive. Number of iterations = (n-2) - 2 + 1 = n-3 = 13438.
For each k, we check if n % k == 0. 13441 has no divisor k with 2 <= k <= 115 (floor(sqrt(13441)) = 115), so no divisor will be found in the loop; therefore the condition is False on every iteration, so the branch is not taken each time. So line 8's branch is 'N' repeated 13438 times.
