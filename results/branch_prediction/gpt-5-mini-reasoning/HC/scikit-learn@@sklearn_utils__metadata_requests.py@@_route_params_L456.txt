[THOUGHT]
We start with self._requests = {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}. params contains both keys with non-None values, so args becomes the same dict. The loop over self._requests.items() iterates twice in insertion order: first ('sample_weight', True), then ('metadata', True).

For each iteration:
- The check "if alias is False or alias == WARN" is False (alias is True) => 'N' for both iterations.
- The "elif alias is True and prop in args" is True for both iterations because alias is True and both props are present in args => 'Y' for both iterations.
- The subsequent elifs ("alias is None ..." and "alias in args") are not reached in either iteration, and would be False if evaluated: record 'N' for each iteration for those branch points.
After the loop, unrequested is empty, so "if unrequested:" is False (only encountered once) => 'N'.

So the branch outcomes are:
- line 24 (alias is False or alias == WARN): ['N', 'N']
- line 26 (alias is True and prop in args): ['Y', 'Y']
- line 28 (alias is None and prop in args): ['N', 'N']
- line 30 (alias in args): ['N', 'N']
- line 32 (if unrequested): ['N']
