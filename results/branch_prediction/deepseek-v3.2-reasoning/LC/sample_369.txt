We are given the input var = " 99 777". Let's trace execution step by step.

Line 2: if var.isdigit(): var.isdigit() checks if all characters are digits. var contains spaces, so it returns False. The condition is false, so the branch is not taken. We record "N" for this single encounter.

Line 4: elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit(): This is evaluated because the previous condition was false. var.replace('.', '', 1) removes at most one dot, but var has no dots, so it returns the original string " 99 777". Then .isdigit() returns False because there are spaces. The condition is false, so the branch is not taken. We record "N".

Line 6: elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1: var.count(' ') counts spaces. There are two spaces (positions 0 and 3). len(var) is 7, so len(var)-1 is 6. 2 == 6 is false, so the branch is not taken. We record "N".

Line 8: elif len(var) == 1: len(var) is 7, so false. The branch is not taken. We record "N".

Line 10: else: Since all previous conditions were false, the else branch is taken. We record "Y".

Each branch point is encountered exactly once (or not at all for later ones if an earlier branch was taken, but here all earlier branches were not taken, so all were encountered). So each list has one element.

1 def f(var):
2     if var.isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return "int"
4     elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return "float"
6     elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
7         return "str"
8     elif len(var) == 1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
9         return "char"
10     else:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
11         return "tuple"
