[THOUGHT]
Given input x=1, n=1. At line 4, the condition (n == 1) is evaluated. Since n equals 1, the condition is true, so the branch is taken. The function then executes the return statement at line 5, returning (x == 1) which is true since x=1. No further code is executed, and the branch is encountered only once during this execution.

7     while (power < x):
8         power = power * n
9     return (power == x)
