[THOUGHT]
The input argument `a` is the string "cos(2*phi)/2". In the context of SymPy, this is a division expression, which is represented as a Mul (multiplication) of cos(2*phi) and 1/2. 
- First branch: `a.is_MatMul` checks if it is a matrix multiplication. Since it is a scalar expression, it is not a MatMul, so the branch is not taken. Outcome: 'N'.
- Second branch: `a.is_Mul` checks if it is a multiplication. Since `cos(2*phi)/2` is a Mul, the branch is taken. Outcome: 'Y'. Then `a` becomes `a.args[0]` which is `cos(2*phi)`. 
Finally, the function returns `a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative`, which for `cos(2*phi)` is False.
