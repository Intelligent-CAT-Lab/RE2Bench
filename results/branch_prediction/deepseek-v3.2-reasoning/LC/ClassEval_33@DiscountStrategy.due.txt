[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of the `due` method with the given input:
- The input provides `self.promotion` as a function object (represented as a string), so `self.promotion is None` is False.
- Therefore, when the `if` condition on line 12 is evaluated, it is not taken. For the single execution, this branch point is encountered once and not taken, so append 'N'.
- Since the `if` condition is False, the `else` branch on line 14 is taken. For this single execution, this branch point is encountered once and taken, so append 'Y'.
The method is called only once, so each branch has exactly one outcome.
