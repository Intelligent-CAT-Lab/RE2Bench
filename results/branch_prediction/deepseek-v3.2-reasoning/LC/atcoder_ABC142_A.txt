[THOUGHT]
The input is 99, so N = 99. The condition N % 2 == 0 is evaluated at line 2. Since 99 % 2 = 1, the condition is false, so the if branch is not taken. Therefore, the else branch at line 4 is taken. Each branch point is encountered exactly once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
