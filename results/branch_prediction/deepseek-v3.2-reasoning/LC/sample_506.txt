[THOUGHT]
We execute f(n) with n=1.
Line 2: p = ''.
Line 3: if n%2 == 1: 1%2=1, condition true → branch taken. So for branch at line 3, taken once: 'Y'.
Line 4: p+='sn' → p becomes 'sn'.
Line 5: else branch is not taken because the if condition was true. So for branch at line 5, taken once: 'N'.
Line 6: skipped.
Line 7: for x in range(1, n+1): range(1,2) yields x=1 only.
Line 8: if x%2 == 0: 1%2=1, condition false → branch not taken. So for branch at line 8, taken once: 'N'.
Line 10: else branch is taken because the if condition was false. So for branch at line 10, taken once: 'Y'.
Line 11: p+='ts' → p becomes 'snts'.
Line 12: return p.
Thus branch outcomes:
Line 3: ['Y']
Line 5: ['N']
Line 8: ['N']
Line 10: ['Y']
