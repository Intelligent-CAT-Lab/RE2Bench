[THOUGHT]
The function maximum is called with arr = [-4, 4] and k = 2. The branch condition `if k == 0` is evaluated once at line 4. Since k = 2, the condition is false, so the branch is not taken. Therefore, the branch outcome is a single 'N'.

2 def maximum(arr, k):
3 
4     if k == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return []
6     arr.sort()
7     ans = arr[-k:]
8     return ans
9
