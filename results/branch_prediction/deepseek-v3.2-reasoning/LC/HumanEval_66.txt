[THOUGHT]
The function digitSum is called with s = "You arE Very Smart". The first thing it does is check if s is an empty string. Since s is not empty, the condition s == "" evaluates to False. Therefore, the branch at line 4 is not taken. This branch point is encountered exactly once during the execution.
