[THOUGHT]
The input is "1". At line 1, `x = int("1")` sets `x` to 1. At line 2, the condition `x == 1` evaluates to `True`, so the `if` branch is taken. This branch point is encountered only once, so the list has one element: `['Y']`. At line 4, the `else` branch is not taken because the `if` condition was true, so it is encountered once and not taken: `['N']`.

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
