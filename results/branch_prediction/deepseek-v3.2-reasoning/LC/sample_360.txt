[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with text="g" and n=15.
At line 2, the condition checks if len(text) <= 2.
len("g") = 1, which is <= 2, so the condition is true.
Therefore, the branch is taken. The branch point is encountered only once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, n):
2     if len(text) <= 2: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return text
4     leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
5     return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
