[THOUGHT]
Input is 9.
n = 9.
while n % 2 == 0: 9 % 2 = 1, condition false, loop body not executed.
if n == 1: 9 == 1 is false, so the branch is not taken. For line 4, taken? No -> ['N'].
Since the if condition is false, the else branch is taken. For line 6, taken? Yes -> ['Y'].

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
