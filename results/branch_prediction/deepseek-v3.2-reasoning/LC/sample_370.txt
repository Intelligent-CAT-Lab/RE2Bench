[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with text = "     i". This string contains 5 spaces followed by an 'i'. The loop iterates over each character:

- For the first five characters (all spaces), char.isspace() returns True, so not char.isspace() is False. The branch is not taken (N).
- For the sixth character ('i'), char.isspace() returns False, so not char.isspace() is True. The branch is taken (Y), and the function returns False immediately.

Thus, the branch outcomes are N, N, N, N, N, Y.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     for char in text:
3         if not char.isspace(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
