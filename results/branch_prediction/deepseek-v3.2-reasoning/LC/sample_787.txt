[THOUGHT]
The input text is "xzd", so len(text) is 3, which is not 0. Therefore, at line 2, the condition len(text) == 0 is false, so the branch is not taken. This branch point is encountered only once during execution.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     if len(text) == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return ''
4     text = text.lower()
5     return text[0].upper() + text[1:]
[/ANSWER]
