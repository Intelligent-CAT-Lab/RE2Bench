[THOUGHT]
The input is "7 5 5". Line 2 creates a tuple ABC = (7, 5, 5). At line 3, ABC.count(5) equals 2, so the condition ABC.count(5) == 2 is True, meaning the if branch is taken once ('Y'). Since the if branch is taken, the else branch at line 5 is not taken once ('N'). There are no loops, so each branch is encountered exactly once.

[ANSWER]
1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
