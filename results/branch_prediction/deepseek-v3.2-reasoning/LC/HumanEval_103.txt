[THOUGHT]
The input has n=185, m=546. The branch condition at line 3 checks if m < n. Since 546 < 185 is false, the branch is not taken. Therefore, the branch outcome is 'N' for that single encounter.

[ANSWER]
1 def rounded_avg(n, m):
2 
3     if m < n: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         return -1
5     summation = 0
6     for i in range(n, m+1):
7         summation += i
8     return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
