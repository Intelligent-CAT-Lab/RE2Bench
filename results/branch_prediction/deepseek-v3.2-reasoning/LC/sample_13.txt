[THOUGHT]
The input names is a list: ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]. The loop iterates over each element:
- First iteration: i = "sharron". The string contains only alphabetic characters, so isalpha() returns True, and the branch is taken (append 'Y').
- Second iteration: i = "Savannah". Similarly, all alphabetic, so isalpha() returns True, branch taken (append 'Y').
- Third iteration: i = "Mike Cherokee". This string contains a space, which is not an alphabetic character, so isalpha() returns False, and the branch is not taken (append 'N').
Thus, the branch outcomes in order are 'Y', 'Y', 'N'.

1 def f(names):
2     count = len(names)
3     numberOfNames = 0
4     for i in names:
5         if i.isalpha(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y,N][/BRANCH]
6             numberOfNames += 1
7     return numberOfNames
