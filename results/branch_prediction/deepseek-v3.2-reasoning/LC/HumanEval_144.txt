[THOUGHT]
Given input x="7/2", n="4/2":

- At line 4: a, b = x.split("/") -> a="7", b="2"
- At line 5: c, d = n.split("/") -> c="4", d="2"
- At line 6: numerator = int(a) * int(c) = 7 * 4 = 28
- At line 7: denom = int(b) * int(d) = 2 * 2 = 4
- At line 8: if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)):
  - numerator/denom = 28 / 4 = 7.0
  - int(numerator/denom) = int(7.0) = 7
  - Since 7.0 == 7 is True, the condition is true.
- Therefore, the branch at line 8 is taken, and the function executes line 9 and returns True.
- The branch point is encountered only once during execution, so the list for taken has one element: 'Y'.
