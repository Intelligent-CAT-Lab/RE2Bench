[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem = 6`. At line 2, the condition `elem in array` checks if `6` is present in the list. Since `6` is the first element, the condition evaluates to `True`, so the branch is taken. This branch is encountered only once during the execution, so the outcome is `Y`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
