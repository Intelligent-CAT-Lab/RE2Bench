[THOUGHT]
The input is "FFEE". After sorting, s becomes ['E', 'E', 'F', 'F']. Then we evaluate the condition: s[0] == s[1] is True (both 'E'), s[2] == s[3] is True (both 'F'), and s[0] != s[2] is True ('E' != 'F'). So the overall condition is True. Therefore, the if branch on line 2 is taken (prints "Yes"), and the else branch on line 3 is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 s = sorted ( input ( ) )
2 if s [ 0 ] == s [ 1 ] and s [ 2 ] == s [ 3 ] and s [ 0 ] != s [ 2 ] : print ( 'Yes' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3 else : print ( 'No' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
