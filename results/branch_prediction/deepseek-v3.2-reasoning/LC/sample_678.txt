[THOUGHT]
Input text = "HI". text.lower() yields "hi". Loop over characters:
1st iteration: c = 'h'. freq is empty, so 'h' not in freq -> condition false -> line 4 branch not taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y). freq becomes {'h': 1}.
2nd iteration: c = 'i'. 'i' not in freq -> condition false -> line 4 branch not taken (N), line 6 branch taken (Y). freq becomes {'h':1, 'i':1}.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     freq = dict()
3     for c in text.lower():
4         if c in freq: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N][/BRANCH]
5             freq[c] += 1
6         else:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y][/BRANCH]
7             freq[c] = 1
8     return freq
