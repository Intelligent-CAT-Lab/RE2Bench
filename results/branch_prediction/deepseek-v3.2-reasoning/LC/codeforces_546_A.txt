[THOUGHT]
Input: "1 1 1" -> k=1, n=1, w=1.
Initialize sum = 0.
Loop: for i in range(1, w+1) = range(1,2) -> i = 1 only.
sum += k * i = 0 + 1*1 = 1.
After loop, sum = 1.
Condition: if sum <= n -> 1 <= 1 -> True.
Thus branch is taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
9 
10
