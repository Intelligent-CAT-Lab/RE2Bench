[THOUGHT]
We simulate the check_in method with the given input:
- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}
- room_type = "single", room_number = 2, name = "guest 1"

Line 11: if (room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()): 
   self.booked_rooms.keys() gives dict_keys(['single']). "single" is in keys, so condition is false. Branch not taken -> append 'N'.

Line 13: if (name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]):
   self.booked_rooms[room_type] = {}.
   name = "guest 1" is not in {}. Condition false -> branch not taken -> append 'N'.

The inner block (lines 14-19) is not executed because the condition at line 13 is false. Therefore, the branch points at lines 14, 16, and 18 are never encountered. So we have no branch outcomes for them.

Thus:
- Branch at line 11: taken= ['N']
- Branch at line 13: taken= ['N']
- Branch at line 14: taken= []
- Branch at line 16: taken= []
- Branch at line 18: taken= []
