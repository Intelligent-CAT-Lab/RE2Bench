[THOUGHT]
Given input:
- `self.students` contains keys "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie".
- Method call: `get_gpa(name="Charlie")`.

Evaluate the condition on line 9: `(name in self.students) and self.students[name]['courses']`.
1. `name in self.students`: "Charlie" is a key in `self.students` → True.
2. `self.students["Charlie"]['courses']` is `{"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}` (non-empty dictionary) → True.
Thus, the condition is True, so the `if` branch (line 9) is taken, and the `else` branch (line 11) is not taken.

Each branch point is encountered only once during this execution, so:
- Line 9: taken = ['Y']
- Line 11: taken = ['N']
