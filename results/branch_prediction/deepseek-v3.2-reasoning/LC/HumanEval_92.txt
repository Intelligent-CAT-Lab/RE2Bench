[THOUGHT]
Given input: x=2, y=1, z=1.
- Line 5: Check if all are integers. isinstance(2, int) is True, isinstance(1, int) is True, isinstance(1, int) is True. Condition is True, so branch taken once → ['Y'].
- Line 6: Condition checks if any two sum equals the third. Compute:
  x+y = 2+1 = 3, compare to z=1 → False.
  x+z = 2+1 = 3, compare to y=1 → False.
  y+z = 1+1 = 2, compare to x=2 → True.
  Overall condition True, so branch taken once → ['Y'].
