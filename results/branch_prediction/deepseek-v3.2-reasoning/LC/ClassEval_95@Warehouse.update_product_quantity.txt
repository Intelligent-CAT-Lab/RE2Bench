[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of update_product_quantity with the given input.
- self.inventory is {"1": {"name": "product 1", "quantity": 2}}.
- product_id is 1 (integer).
- The condition `product_id in self.inventory` checks if the integer 1 is a key in the dictionary. Since the dictionary's keys are strings, this condition is False.
- Therefore, the branch is not taken. Since the branch point is encountered only once, we append 'N'.
