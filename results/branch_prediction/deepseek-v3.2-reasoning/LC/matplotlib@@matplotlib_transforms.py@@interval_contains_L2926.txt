[THOUGHT]
The input provides interval as "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])", which likely represents an array with two elements: a = -107.73502692 and b = -7.73502692. Val is -80.0. On line 2, a and b are assigned these values. Since a = -107.73502692 and b = -7.73502692, and -107.73502692 < -7.73502692, the condition a > b on line 3 evaluates to false. Therefore, the branch is not taken. This branch point is encountered only once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
