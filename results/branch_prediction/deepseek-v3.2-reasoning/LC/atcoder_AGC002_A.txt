[THOUGHT]
Input: "1 1000000000" gives a=1, b=1000000000.
Line 2: if a <= 0 and 0 <= b: a=1 <= 0 is False, so condition False → branch not taken (N).
Line 4: elif a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0: a=1 < 0 is False, so condition False → branch not taken (N).
Line 6: else branch: since both if and elif false, else taken (Y).
Each branch encountered once. So lists are length 1.

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 if a <= 0 and 0 <= b : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "Zero" )
4 elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( "Negative" )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( "Positive" )
