[THOUGHT]
The input list is [9, 9, 9, 9]. The condition `l == sorted(l)` evaluates to True because sorting the list in ascending order yields the same list. Since the condition uses `or`, short-circuiting occurs and the second part `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is not evaluated. The overall condition is True, so the if branch is taken exactly once.
