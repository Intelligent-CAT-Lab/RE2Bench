[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of remove_item with given input:
- self.items is {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 4}}
- item is "apple"
- The method checks: if "apple" in self.items? Yes, so the condition is true.
- Therefore, the if branch (line 9) is taken, and the else branch (line 11) is not taken.
- Each branch is encountered once during this execution, so we record one outcome per branch.
