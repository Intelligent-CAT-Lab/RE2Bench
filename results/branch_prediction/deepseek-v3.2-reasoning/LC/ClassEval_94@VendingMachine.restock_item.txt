[THOUGHT]
Simulating the execution of restock_item with the given input:
- The self.inventory is {"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 10}}
- item_name = "Pizza", quantity = 10
- At line 10, condition checks if "Pizza" in self.inventory. "Pizza" is not present, so the if branch is not taken. This branch point is encountered once, so we record 'N'.
- Since the if condition is false, execution proceeds to the else branch at line 13. This branch is taken once, so we record 'Y'.
- The method returns False.
