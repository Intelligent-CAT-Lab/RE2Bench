[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with array=[1] and index=0.
At line 2, condition index < 0 is evaluated: 0 < 0 is false, so the branch is not taken.
The branch point is encountered only once.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
