[THOUGHT]
The function f is called once with items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"] and target = "**". 
Line 2 is executed once. The condition "target in items" evaluates to True because "**" is in the list. Therefore the branch is taken. There is only one encounter, so the list has one element: 'Y'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
