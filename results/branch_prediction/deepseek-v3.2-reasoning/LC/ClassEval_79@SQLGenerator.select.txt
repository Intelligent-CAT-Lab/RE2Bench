[THOUGHT]
We are simulating the call to `select` with the given input. The instance has `table_name = "table1"`. The method is called with `fields` not provided (so defaults to None) and `condition` provided as "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

Execution:
- At line 9, we check `if (fields is None)`. Since fields is None, the condition is True, so the branch is taken. We record 'Y' for this branch point.
- At line 11, the else branch corresponds to the if on line 9. Since the if condition was True, we do not take the else branch. So we record 'N' for this branch point.
- At line 14, we check `if (condition is not None)`. condition is a non-None string, so the condition is True, and the branch is taken. We record 'Y' for this branch point.

Each branch is encountered only once, so we replace "??" with a single character in brackets.
