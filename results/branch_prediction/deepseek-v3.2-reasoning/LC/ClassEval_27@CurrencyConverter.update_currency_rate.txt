[THOUGHT]
We are given an input for method `update_currency_rate` with `currency="CNY"` and `new_rate=7.18`. The `self.rates` dictionary includes "CNY" with a value of 7.18. Therefore, at line 9, the condition `currency not in self.rates` evaluates to False because "CNY" is present. Hence, the branch is not taken. Since the branch is encountered only once during this call, we append 'N'. So the branch annotation should be `taken=[N]`.
