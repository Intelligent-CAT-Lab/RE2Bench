[THOUGHT]
Input is "20 30", so A = 20, B = 30.
Compute ans = A - 2 * B = 20 - 60 = -40.
At line 3, if ans < 0: since ans = -40 < 0, condition is True, so the branch is taken.
This branch point is encountered only once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
