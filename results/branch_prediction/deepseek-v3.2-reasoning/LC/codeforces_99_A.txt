[THOUGHT]
Input is " 2.4" (with a leading space). 
Line 1: num = input().split(".") -> num = [" 2", "4"].
Line 2: Condition: int(num[0][-1]) == 9. num[0] = " 2", last character is '2', int('2')=2. 2 == 9 is false. So branch not taken: N.
Line 4: else branch is taken because the if condition was false: Y.
Line 5: Inside else, condition: int(num[1][0]) >= 5. num[1]="4", first character '4', int('4')=4. 4 >= 5 is false. So branch not taken: N.
Line 7: else branch (for the inner if) is taken: Y.
Thus branch outcomes: line2: [N], line4: [Y], line5: [N], line7: [Y].

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
