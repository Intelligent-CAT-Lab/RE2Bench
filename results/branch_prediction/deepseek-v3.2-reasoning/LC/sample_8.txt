[THOUGHT]
Given the input: string = "UppEr", encryption = 0.
When calling f("UppEr", 0), we evaluate the condition encryption == 0. Since encryption is 0, the condition is True. Therefore, the if branch on line 2 is taken, and the else branch on line 4 is not taken. There are no loops or multiple encounters, so each branch point is encountered exactly once during execution.
Thus:
- For line 2, taken = [Y]
- For line 4, taken = [N]
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
[/ANSWER]
