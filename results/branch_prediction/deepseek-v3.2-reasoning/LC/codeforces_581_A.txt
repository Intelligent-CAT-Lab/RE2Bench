[THOUGHT]
Input is "1 1". The code reads the input, splits it into a list ["1", "1"], converts each element to an integer, resulting in [1, 1]. Then a = 1, b = 1. The condition abs(a - b) >= 2 evaluates to abs(0) >= 2, which is false. Therefore, the if branch at line 7 is not taken (once), and the else branch at line 9 is taken (once).

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
