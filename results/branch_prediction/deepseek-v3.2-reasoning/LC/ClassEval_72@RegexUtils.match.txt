[THOUGHT]
We simulate the call to match with pattern="\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b" and text="iustd87t2euhifg.com".

The pattern is an email regex. The text does not contain '@', so it does not match the pattern. re.match returns None because the pattern does not match at the beginning of the string.

Therefore, `ans` is None, which is falsy. The condition `if ans:` evaluates to False, so the branch to line 9 is not taken. The else branch on line 10 is taken.

Thus for line 8: taken = N, for line 10: taken = Y.
