[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step by step for the given input:

1. We have x = sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit and y = sympy.core.numbers.Pi (the string representations are given, but in actual execution these would be the actual class objects).

2. Line 2-3: Get the class names:
   - n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"
   - n2 = "Pi"

3. Line 4: Check if n1 == n2. "ImaginaryUnit" != "Pi", so this branch is NOT taken → ['N'].

4. Line 7: Check if not issubclass(y, Basic). In SymPy, both ImaginaryUnit and Pi are subclasses of Basic. So issubclass(y, Basic) is True, making the condition False. This branch is NOT taken → ['N'].

5. Lines 10-18: We need to check if the class names are in ordering_of_classes. Without the actual ordering_of_classes list, I need to consider what's likely:
   - In SymPy's _cmp_name function, ordering_of_classes typically contains class names like "Add", "Mul", etc., for ordering in printing/sorting.
   - Both "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" are specific number classes that likely aren't in that ordering list.
   - So both i1 and i2 will likely be UNKNOWN (ValueError will be raised for both).

6. Line 19: Check if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN. Based on step 5, this is True, so this branch IS taken → ['Y'].

7. Line 20: Returns lexicographic comparison of n1 and n2.

So the branch outcomes are:
- Line 4: ['N']
- Line 7: ['N']  
- Line 19: ['Y']
