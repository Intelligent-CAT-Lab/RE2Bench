[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of the deposit method with the given input:
- The method is called with self.balance = 0 and amount = 300.
- At line 9, the condition `if (amount < 0)` is evaluated: amount is 300, which is not less than 0, so the condition is false. Therefore, this branch is not taken. Since this branch point is encountered only once during execution, the list should contain a single 'N'.
- As the branch is not taken, the code proceeds to line 11, updates the balance, and returns it at line 12.
