[THOUGHT]
The function _interval_contains_close is called with interval as an array representing [0., 2.], so a=0.0 and b=2.0. The condition if a > b: is checked once during execution, and since 0.0 > 2.0 is false, the branch is not taken. Therefore, for this branch, the outcome is ['N'].

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
