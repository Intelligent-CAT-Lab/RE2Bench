[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of change_order_status with order_id=1 (integer) and status="Delivered":

- Check condition on line 10: order_id in self.orders. self.orders is {"1": {...}} with key "1" as string. order_id is 1 (integer). In Python, integer 1 is not equal to string "1", so the condition is False. Therefore, the if branch is not taken. This branch point is encountered once, so append 'N'.

- Since the if condition is False, the else branch on line 12 is taken. This branch point is encountered once, so append 'Y'.

- Then, execute line 13: return False, and the method ends.
