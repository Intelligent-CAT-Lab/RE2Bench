[THOUGHT]
We have a function `f` that takes two arguments: `str` and `toget`. The code contains an if-else statement. The condition checks if `str` starts with `toget`. The input provides `str` as "fnuiyh" and `toget` as "ni". "fnuiyh" does not start with "ni", so the condition is false. Therefore, the if branch (line 2) is not taken, and the else branch (line 3) is taken. Since there are no loops, each branch point is encountered exactly once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
