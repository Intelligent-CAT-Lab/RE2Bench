[THOUGHT]
We trace the execution step by step for the input `x=1e-07, base=10, rtol=1e-07`:
- `np.isfinite(1e-07)` returns `True`, so `not np.isfinite(x)` is `False`. The branch on line 4 is not taken: `['N']`.
- `x == 0.0` evaluates to `False` because `1e-07` is not zero. The branch on line 6 is not taken: `['N']`.
- `rtol` is `1e-07`, which is not `None`. The condition on line 9 is `False`, so the branch is not taken: `['N']`.
- The `else` branch on line 11 is taken: `['Y']`.
Each branch is encountered exactly once during execution, so each list contains a single character.
