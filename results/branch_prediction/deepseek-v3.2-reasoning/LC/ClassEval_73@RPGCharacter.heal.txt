[THOUGHT]
We are given the method `heal` of class RPGCharacter. The input self has hp=100. In the method, we first increment self.hp by 10, so self.hp becomes 110. Then we encounter the branch condition `if (self.hp > 100):`. Since 110 > 100, the condition is true, so the branch is taken. This is the only time the branch is encountered during this execution. Therefore, the branch is taken once, so we replace ?? with [Y].
