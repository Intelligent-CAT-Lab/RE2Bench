[THOUGHT]
We are given an instance of VendingMachine with inventory containing "Coke": {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}. The method add_item is called with item_name="Coke", price=1.25, quantity=10.

Execution trace:
1. In add_item (line 10), we call self.restock_item("Coke", 10).
2. In restock_item (line 14), we check if "Coke" is in self.inventory. It is, so the branch is taken → Y.
3. We update the quantity to 30 and return True.
4. Back in add_item, the condition `not True` is False, so the branch at line 10 is not taken → N.
5. The else branch at line 17 in restock_item is not taken because the if condition was true → N.

Each branch point is encountered exactly once. So we have:
Line 10: taken = N
Line 14: taken = Y
Line 17: taken = N
