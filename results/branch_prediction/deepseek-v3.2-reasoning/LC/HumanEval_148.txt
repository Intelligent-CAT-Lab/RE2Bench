[THOUGHT]
Input: planet1="Earth", planet2="Earth".
At line 5, the condition is: planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2.
planet_names contains "Earth", so planet1 not in planet_names is False. Similarly for planet2.
planet1 == planet2 is True since both are "Earth".
So the condition evaluates to False or False or True = True. Therefore the branch is taken.
The branch is encountered only once, and it is taken. So the list is ['Y'].
