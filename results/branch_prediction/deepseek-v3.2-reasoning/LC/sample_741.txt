[THOUGHT]
Given nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and p = 6.
Line 2: prev_p = p - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
Line 3: condition prev_p < 0 evaluates to False because 5 >= 0.
Thus the branch is not taken, and we record 'N'.
The branch is encountered exactly once during execution.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
