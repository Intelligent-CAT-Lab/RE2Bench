Let's think through this step by step. The `remove_item` method is being called with the item "apple" on a cart that already has one "apple". The quantity is not specified, so it defaults to 1. Here is my reasoning:

1. The method first checks if the item is in `self.items`.
   - "apple" is in `self.items`, so this condition evaluates to `True`.
   - Therefore, the first branch is taken.

2. Since the first branch is taken, the else clause is not executed.
   - Therefore, the second branch is not taken.

[ANSWER]
8     def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):
9         if (item in self.items): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10             self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
11         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
12             pass
