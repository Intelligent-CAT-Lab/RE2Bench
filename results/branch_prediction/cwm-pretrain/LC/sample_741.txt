<think>
We are given a function f that takes two arguments: nums (a list of numbers) and p (an integer). The function calculates prev_p as p - 1. If prev_p is less than 0, it wraps around to the last index of nums (len(nums) - 1).

For the input: 
- nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]
- p = 6

We trace the execution:
- At line 2, prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5
- At line 3, check if prev_p < 0 → 5 < 0 → False
- So the branch is not taken, and prev_p remains 5
- At line 4, return nums[prev_p] = nums[5] = 1

Thus, the function returns 1.
</think>
[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
[/ANSWER]
