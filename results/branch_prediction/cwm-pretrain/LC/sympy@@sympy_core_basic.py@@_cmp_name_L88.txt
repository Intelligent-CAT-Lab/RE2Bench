The method _cmp_name is a function that compares two types x and y.
In the first line (4), the variable n1 is assigned the value of x.__name__, and n2 is assigned the value of y.__name__.
Then, in line 5, the function checks if n1 is equal to n2. If they are equal, the function returns 0. In this case, n1 is 'ImaginaryUnit' and n2 is 'Pi', so the condition n1 == n2 is not met and the function continues to the next line.

In line 7, the function checks if y is not a subclass of Basic. If y is not a subclass of Basic, the function returns -1. In this case, y is not a subclass of Basic, so the condition not issubclass(y, Basic) is met and the function returns -1.
