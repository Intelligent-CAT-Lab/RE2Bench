The method `level_up` checks if the current level of the RPG character is less than 100 before proceeding. In this case, the input value for `self.level` is 3, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, the code inside the `if` block will be executed, incrementing the level, resetting exp to 0, and increasing the hp, attack_power, and defense by specified amounts. After the code block, the method returns the updated values of level, hp, attack_power, and defense. Hence, the branch will be taken.

16             self.exp = 0
17             self.hp += 20

19             self.defense += 5
20         return (self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)
