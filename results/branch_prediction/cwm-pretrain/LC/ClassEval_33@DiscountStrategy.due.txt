To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given Python code and determine which branches are taken during the execution of the `due` method for the provided input.

The `due` method checks if `self.promotion` is `None`. If it is, then `discount` is set to 0. Otherwise, `discount` is calculated by calling the `promotion` function with the instance as an argument.

In this case, `self.promotion` is set to a function, so the `else` branch is taken. Therefore, the branch annotation for the `if` statement should be `['N', 'Y']`, where 'N' means the condition is not met (i.e., `self.promotion` is not `None`) and 'Y' means the condition is met (i.e., `self.promotion` is `None`).

Here is the completed branch annotation:

[ANSWER]
class DiscountStrategy():
    def __init__(self, customer, cart, promotion=None):
        self.customer = customer
        self.cart = cart
        self.promotion = promotion
        self.__total = self.total()

    def due(self):
        if (self.promotion is None): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N', 'Y'][/BRANCH]
            discount = 0
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N', 'Y'][/BRANCH]
            discount = self.promotion(self)
        return (self.__total - discount)
[/ANSWER]

Note that in this case, both branches are technically taken (once for the `if` statement and once for the `else` statement), so we include both 'N' and 'Y' in the branch annotation. However, the correct interpretation of the branch annotation is that the `if` statement is not taken (i.e., `self.promotion` is not `None`), and the `else` statement is taken (i.e., `self.promotion` is `None`). 

Also, note that the actual output of the method is not required, only the branch annotation. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
[ANSWER]
1 class DiscountStrategy():
2     def __init__(self, customer, cart, promotion=None):
3         self.customer = customer
4         self.cart = cart
5         self.promotion = promotion
6         self.__total = self.total()
7 
8     def due(self):
9         if (self.promotion is None): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N', 'Y'][/BRANCH]
10             discount = 0
11         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N', 'Y'][/BRANCH]
12             discount = self.promotion(self)
13         return (self.__total - discount)
