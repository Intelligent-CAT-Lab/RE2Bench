m = 546 and n = 185 so the condition m < n at line 4 is 546 < 185 → False → branch not taken
Next, we enter the loop from i = n to m. The loop runs for all i from 185 to 546 inclusive, for a total of 546 - 185 + 1 = 362 iterations.
summation is calculated as the sum of all integers from 185 to 546. Each iteration adds i to summation, accumulating the total.
After the loop, we calculate the average by dividing summation by the total count (362), which is stored in m - n + 1. Then we use round() to get an integer result, and finally convert it to binary using bin().

[ANSWER]
1 def rounded_avg(n, m):
2 
3     if m < n: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         return -1
5     summation = 0
6     for i in range(n, m+1):
7         summation += i
8     return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
