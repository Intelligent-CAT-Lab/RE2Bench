<think>
In the code for `_check_w_h`, the condition `if self.init == 'custom' and update_H:` is checked first. Since self.init is None and update_H is True, this condition is not taken → ['N'].
Then, the next condition `elif not update_H:` is checked. Since update_H is True, this condition is not taken either → ['N'].
The execution proceeds to the `else:` block. Here, there is a check `if W is not None or H is not None:`. Since both W and H are None, this condition is not taken → ['N'].
