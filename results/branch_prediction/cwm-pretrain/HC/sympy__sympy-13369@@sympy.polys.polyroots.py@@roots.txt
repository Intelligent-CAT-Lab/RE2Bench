The input to the `roots` function is a list representing the polynomial coefficients [1, 0, -1], corresponding to the polynomial x^2 - 1. Let's follow the execution flow to determine the branch outcomes.

1. `if isinstance(f, list):` - Since `f` is a list, this branch is taken (`Y`). 
2. `if gens:` - Since no generators are provided, this branch is not taken (`N`).
3. `poly, i = {}, len(f) - 1` - Initializes an empty dictionary `poly` and sets `i` to 2.
4. The loop `for coeff in f:` iterates over the coefficients [1, 0, -1], and for each coefficient, it creates a key-value pair in `poly` (e.g., {2: 1, 1: 0, 0: -1}).
5. `f = Poly(poly, x, field=True)` - Creates a `Poly` object from the dictionary `poly` with the variable `x`.
6. `if f.length == 2 and f.degree() != 1:` - This condition is not met since the length of the polynomial is 3, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
7. `if not k:` - `k` is determined by `f.terms_gcd()` and is not zero, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
8. `if not f.is_ground:` - The polynomial is not a ground (constant) polynomial, so this branch is taken (`Y`).
9. Since `f.get_domain().is_Ring` is false, the branch is not taken (`N`).
10. `if not f.is_ground:` - This branch is taken (`Y`).
11. `if f.degree() == 1:` - The degree is not 1, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
12. `if f.length() == 2:` - The length is not 2, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
13. `if len(factors) == 1 and f.degree() == 2:` - The factors are not of length 1 or degree 2, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
14. `if len(factors) == 1 and factors[0][1] == 1:` - This condition is met, so this branch is taken (`Y`).
15. Since `f.get_domain().is_EX` is true, the branch is taken (`Y`).
16. `res = to_rational_coeffs(f)` - Converts the polynomial to rational coefficients. This returns None, so the subsequent branches are not taken (`N`).
17. `if res:` - This condition is not met, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
18. The loop `for r in _try_heuristics(f):` iterates over the roots found by `_try_heuristics(f)`, which for the polynomial x^2 - 1, are 1 and -1.
19. `for root in _try_heuristics(f):` - The roots 1 and -1 are added to the result dictionary.
20. `if coeff is not S.One:` - This condition is not met, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
21. `if filter not in [None, 'C']:` - Since no filter is provided, this branch is not taken (`N`).
22. `if predicate is not None:` - Since no predicate is provided, this branch is not taken (`N`).
23. `if rescale_x:` - This condition is not met, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
24. `if translate_x:` - This condition is not met, so this branch is not taken (`N`).
25. `if not multiple:` - Since multiple is False, this branch is taken (`Y`).
