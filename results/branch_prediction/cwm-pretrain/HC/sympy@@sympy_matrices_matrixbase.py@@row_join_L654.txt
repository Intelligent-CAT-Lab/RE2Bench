<think>
In the `row_join` method, the first condition is `if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:`:
- self.cols = 2, so `self.cols == 0` is False. 
- Since this is an `and` condition, the entire condition is False, and this block is skipped.

Therefore, the branch is not taken and the value for `taken=?` should be "N".

101    def row_join(self, other: Self) -> Self:
102        if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
103            return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
104        if self.rows != other.rows:
105            raise ShapeError('The matrices have incompatible number of rows ({} and {})'.format(self.rows, other.rows))
106        return self._eval_row_join(other)
