<think>
In the delete method, the condition `if self.pk is None:` is checked once.
Since `self.pk` is not None, it is not taken → ['N']. 
</think>

[ANSWER]
...
145     def delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):
146         if self.pk is None: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
147             raise ValueError(
148                 "%s object can't be deleted because its %s attribute is set "
149                 "to None." % (self._meta.object_name, self._meta.pk.attname)
150             )
151         using = using or router.db_for_write(self.__class__, instance=self)
152         collector = Collector(using=using, origin=self)
153         collector.collect([self], keep_parents=keep_parents)
154         return collector.delete()
