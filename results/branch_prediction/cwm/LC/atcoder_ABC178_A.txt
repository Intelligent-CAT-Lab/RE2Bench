The input value is 1. Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. x = int(input()) reads the input and converts it to an integer, so x becomes 1.
2. The if condition checks if x == 1. Since x is 1, this condition is true.
3. The code inside the if block is executed, which is print(0).
4. The else block is not executed because the if condition was true.

So, the branch at line 2 is taken (Y), and the branch at line 4 is not taken (N).

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
