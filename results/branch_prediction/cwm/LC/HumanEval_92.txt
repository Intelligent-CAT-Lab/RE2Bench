The function any_int takes three arguments: x, y, and z. We are given the input values x=2, y=1, and z=1. The function checks if all three are integers, then checks if any pair sums to the third. 

First, at line 5, it checks if x, y, and z are all integers using isinstance(). Since all inputs are integers, this condition evaluates to True. So, the branch at line 5 is taken, and 'Y' is appended to its 'taken' list.

Next, at line 6, it checks if (x+y == z) or (x+z == y) or (y+z == x). Let's evaluate each part:
- x + y = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not equal to z (1) → False
- x + z = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not equal to y (1) → False
- y + z = 1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to x (2) → True

Since one of the conditions is True, the overall condition at line 6 is True. Therefore, the branch at line 6 is taken, and 'Y' is appended to its 'taken' list.

Because the condition at line 6 is True, the function returns True at line 7, and does not reach line 8 or line 9.
