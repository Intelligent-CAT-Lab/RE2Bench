Simulate the execution of the `get_gpa` method with the input name "Charlie":

1. The method starts by checking if the `name` is in `self.students` and if the student has any courses.
   - "Charlie" is indeed in `self.students`, so the first part of the condition is true.
   - "Charlie" has courses: {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}, so the second part is also true.
   - Since both conditions are true, the `if` branch is taken → append 'Y'.

2. The method then calculates the GPA by summing the course values and dividing by the number of courses.
   - Sum of course values: 70 + 80 = 150
   - Number of courses: 2
   - GPA: 150 / 2 = 75

3. The `else` branch is not taken since the `if` condition was true → append 'N'.
