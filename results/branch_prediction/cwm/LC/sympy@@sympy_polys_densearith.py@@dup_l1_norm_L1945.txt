<think>
The function `dup_l1_norm` takes a list `f` and a domain `K` as arguments. 

1. The function checks if `f` is empty using the condition `if not f:`.
2. Since `f` is an empty list (`[]`), the condition is `True` and the function returns `K.zero`.

Therefore, the branch `if not f:` is taken (appended with 'Y') and the branch `else:` is not taken (appended with 'N').

13 def dup_l1_norm(f: dup[Eabs], K: Domain[Eabs]) -> Eabs:
14     if not f: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
15         return K.zero
16     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
17         return K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))
