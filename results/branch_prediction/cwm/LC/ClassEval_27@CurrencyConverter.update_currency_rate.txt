Now, let's analyze the method `update_currency_rate` with the given input. The method checks if the provided `currency` exists in `self.rates`. If it doesn't exist, the branch at line 9 is taken, and `False` is returned. If it does exist, the branch is not taken, and the rate is updated.

In this case, the `currency` is "CNY", and we need to check if "CNY" is in `self.rates`. Looking at `self.rates`, "CNY" is indeed present with a value of 7.18. Therefore, the condition `currency not in self.rates` evaluates to `False`, and the branch at line 9 is not taken. Instead, the rate for "CNY" is updated to `new_rate`, which is also 7.18 in this case.

[ANSWER]
8     def update_currency_rate(self, currency, new_rate):
9         if (currency not in self.rates): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
10             return False
11         self.rates[currency] = new_rate
