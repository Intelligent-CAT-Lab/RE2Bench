The function f is called with array [6, 2, 7, 1] and elem 6. Let's follow the execution step by step.

1. The first line defines the function f with parameters array and elem.
2. At line 2, the condition checks if elem (6) is in array ([6, 2, 7, 1]). Since 6 is present in the array, the condition evaluates to True.
3. Because the condition is True, the code executes line 3, which returns the index of elem in the array. The index of 6 in [6, 2, 7, 1] is 0.
4. The function exits at line 3 and does not reach line 4.

So, the branch at line 2 is taken (Y), and the branch at line 4 is not taken (N). However, since the code exits at line 3, the branch at line 4 is never encountered.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
