The method `get_display_profile` checks if the platform is 'win32'. If not, it returns None. Since the input platform is not specified, we can assume it's not 'win32' for now. But let's analyze further.

The input `handle` is None. So, in the `core.get_display_profile_win32` call, it will be `int(None or 0)`, which is `0`. 

Now, let's check the branches:

1. `if sys.platform != "win32":` -> This branch is taken if the platform is not 'win32'. However, since the platform is not specified, we can't be sure. But given the context, it's likely that the platform is not 'win32', so this branch is taken.

2. `if isinstance(handle, ImageWin.HDC):` -> Since `handle` is None, this branch is not taken.

3. `if profile is None:` -> We don't know the value of `profile` without running the code. However, since `profile` is assigned a value from `core.get_display_profile_win32`, which is a C function, we can't be sure. But assuming the function returns a valid profile, this branch is not taken.

So, the branch outcomes are:

1. `if sys.platform != "win32":` -> ['Y']
2. `if isinstance(handle, ImageWin.HDC):` -> ['N']
3. `if profile is None:` -> ['N']
