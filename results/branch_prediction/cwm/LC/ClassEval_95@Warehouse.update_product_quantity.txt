Simulate the execution of `update_product_quantity` with the given input:
* `self.inventory` has a key `"1"` (a string), but the input `product_id` is `1` (an integer).
* The condition `if (product_id in self.inventory):` checks if the integer `1` is a key in `self.inventory`, which contains string keys.
* Since the types don't match, the condition is `False`, so this branch is not taken → append 'N'.
