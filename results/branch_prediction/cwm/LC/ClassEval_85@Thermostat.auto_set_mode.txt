I will simulate the execution of auto_set_mode() with the given input.

The current_temperature is 25 and target_temperature is also 25. The mode is initially "cool".

In the auto_set_mode() method, the first line is an if condition checking if current_temperature is less than target_temperature. Since both are 25, the condition is false, so this branch is not taken → append 'N'.

The else branch will be taken because the if condition is false → append 'Y'. This sets the mode to 'cool', but since it was already 'cool', there's no change, but the branch is still taken.

So the branch taken list for the if statement is ['N', 'Y'].

Wait, but in the code, the else is on the same line as the if's closing colon, so it's part of the same if-else block. The way the problem is structured, each branch point (if or else) is considered separately. But in this case, the else is directly tied to the if. So when the if condition is false, the else branch is taken. Therefore, the if branch is 'N' and the else branch is 'Y'.

But looking back at the code structure:

11     def auto_set_mode(self):
12         if (self.current_temperature < self.target_temperature): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
13             self.mode = 'heat'
14         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
15             self.mode = 'cool'

So there are two branch points here: the if statement at line 12 and the else statement at line 14. Both are separate branch points as per the code comments.

Given current_temperature (25) is not less than target_temperature (25), the if condition is false. Therefore, the if branch is not taken ('N'), and the else branch is taken ('Y').

So the annotations should be:
- Line 12: taken=['N']
- Line 14: taken=['Y']

But wait, the problem says "for each time that branch point is encountered during execution". Since the else is only encountered when the if is not taken, and in this case, the if is not taken once, the else is taken once. So each branch point is encountered once.

Therefore, the correct annotations are:
- Line 12: taken=['N']
- Line 14: taken=['Y']
