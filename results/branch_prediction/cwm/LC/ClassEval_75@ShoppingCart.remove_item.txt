I'll reason step by step to solve this problem.

First, let's look at the input data. The "item" parameter is "apple" and the quantity to remove is 1 (default value). The ShoppingCart instance has an "items" dictionary containing "apple" with a quantity of 4.

Now, let's examine the remove_item method:

1. The method starts by checking if the item is in self.items.
2. If it is, it decreases the quantity by the specified amount.
3. If not, it does nothing (pass).

Given the input data, the item "apple" is indeed in self.items, so the first branch (item in self.items) should be taken, and the else branch should not be taken.

So, the branch outcomes should be:
- The first branch (if item in self.items) is taken: 'Y'
- The else branch is not taken: 'N'
</think>
[ANSWER]
8     def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):
9         if (item in self.items): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10             self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
11         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
12             pass
[/ANSWER]
