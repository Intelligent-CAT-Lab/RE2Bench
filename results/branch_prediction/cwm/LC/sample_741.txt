Let's analyze the given Python function step by step with the provided input.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` (a list of numbers) and `p` (an index). The goal of the function is to return the element at the previous index of `p` in the list `nums`. If the previous index is less than 0, it wraps around to the last element of the list.

Input values:
- `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]`
- `p = 6`

Step-by-step execution:

1. At line 2, `prev_p` is calculated as `p - 1`. Since `p` is 6, `prev_p` becomes 5.
2. At line 3, there is a conditional check: `if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1`. This checks if `prev_p` is less than 0. Since `prev_p` is 5 (not less than 0), the condition is false, and the branch is not taken.
3. At line 4, the function returns `nums[prev_p]`. Since `prev_p` is 5, it returns `nums[5]`, which is 1.

Therefore, the branch at line 3 is not taken because `prev_p` is not less than 0.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
