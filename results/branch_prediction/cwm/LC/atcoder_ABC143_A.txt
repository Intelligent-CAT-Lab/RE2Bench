The input values are A = 20 and B = 30. Let's calculate ans on line 2:
ans = A - 2 * B = 20 - 2 * 30 = 20 - 60 = -40.

Now, on line 3, the condition is if ans < 0:
Since ans is -40, which is less than 0, the condition is True, so the branch is taken.

The branch taken value is 'Y' because the condition is True.

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
