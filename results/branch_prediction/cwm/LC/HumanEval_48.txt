The function is_palindrome checks if the given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

The input text is "xywzx". 

The loop iterates over the range of the length of the text, which is 5. So, the loop will run for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

At each iteration, the function checks if the character at index i is not equal to the character at the corresponding index from the end of the string (len(text) - 1 - i). 

Let's go through each iteration:

1. i = 0: text[0] = 'x' and text[4] = 'x'. They are equal, so the condition is False, and the branch is not taken ('N').
2. i = 1: text[1] = 'y' and text[3] = 'z'. They are not equal, so the condition is True, and the branch is taken ('Y'). The function immediately returns False.
   
Since the function returns False at i = 1, the loop does not continue to i = 2, 3, or 4.

So, the branch at line 6 is taken only once.
