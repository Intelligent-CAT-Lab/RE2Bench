Let's step through the code with the given input.

First, the function `_is_decade` is called with `x = 1e-07`, `base = 10`, and `rtol = 1e-07`.

1. `if not np.isfinite(x):` - Here, `x` is a very small number (1e-07), but it's still finite. Therefore, this condition is `False`, and the branch is not taken. So, `taken = [N]`.

2. `if x == 0.0:` - Since `x` is 1e-07 (not zero), this condition is also `False`, and the branch is not taken. Now, `taken = [N, N]`.

3. `lx = np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)` - This calculates the logarithm of `x` with base `10`. For `x = 1e-07`, this results in `lx = -7.0`.

4. `if rtol is None:` - Since `rtol = 1e-07` (not `None`), this condition is `False`, and the branch is not taken. Now, `taken = [N, N, N]`.

5. The `else` block is executed: `return np.isclose(lx, np.round(lx), rtol=rtol)`. Here, `lx` is `-7.0`, `np.round(lx)` is also `-7.0`, and `rtol = 1e-07`. Since `-7.0` is exactly equal to itself, `np.isclose` returns `True`.

So, the final `taken` values are `[N, N, N]`.
