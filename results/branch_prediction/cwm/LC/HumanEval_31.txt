Let's break down the code step by step to determine the branch outcomes.

The function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime. It first checks if `n` is less than 2 (line 5). If it is, the function returns `False` because numbers less than 2 are not prime.

Then, it loops from 2 to `n - 2` (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value) to check if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers (line 8). If `n` is divisible by any of them, the function returns `False` because `n` is not a prime number.

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, let's apply this to the input `n = 13441`.

1. At line 5, the condition `n < 2` is checked. Since `13441` is not less than 2, this condition is `False`, so the branch is not taken. The outcome for this branch is `N`.

2. The loop at line 7 runs from 2 to `13441 - 2 = 13439`. For each `k` in this range, the condition `n % k == 0` is checked. If `13441` is divisible by any `k`, the function returns `False`. However, since `13441` is a prime number, none of these conditions will be `True`. Therefore, the branch at line 8 is never taken, and the outcome for this branch is a list of `N`s for each iteration.

Since `13441` is indeed a prime number, the function will return `True` at line 10.
