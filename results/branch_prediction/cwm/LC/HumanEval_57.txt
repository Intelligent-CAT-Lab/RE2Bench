The function `monotonic` checks if a list is either sorted in ascending or descending order. 

Given the input list `[9, 9, 9, 9]`, we need to evaluate the condition at line 5:
`if l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True):`

First, `sorted(l)` will sort the list in ascending order, which is `[9, 9, 9, 9]`. Since the original list `l` is equal to this sorted list, the first part of the condition (`l == sorted(l)`) is True.

The second part of the condition (`l == sorted(l, reverse=True)`) will sort the list in descending order, which is also `[9, 9, 9, 9]`. Again, the original list `l` is equal to this sorted list, so the second part of the condition is also True.

However, since the first part of the condition is already True, the entire condition evaluates to True, and the branch is taken.

Therefore, the branch at line 5 is taken once.
