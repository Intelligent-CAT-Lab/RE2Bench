Let's go through the code step by step. The function `f` takes two arguments: `items` and `target`. The function checks if `target` is in the list `items`. If it is, it returns the index of `target` in the list. If not, it returns -1.

Given the input, `items` is a list containing ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"], and `target` is "**". 

Now, let's evaluate the condition at line 2: `if target in items`. Since "**" is indeed in the list `items`, the condition is True. Therefore, the branch is taken, and the code executes line 3, returning the index of "**" in the list.

So, the branch at line 2 is taken once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
