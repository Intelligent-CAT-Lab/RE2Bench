Let's analyze the code step by step.

The input is 9, so n = 9 at line 1.

At line 2, we check if n % 2 == 0. Since 9 is odd, this condition is False, so the while loop is not entered. The branch is not taken, so the outcome is 'N'.

Next, at line 4, we check if n == 1. Since n is 9, this condition is False. So, the 'if' branch is not taken (outcome 'N'), and we move to the 'else' branch at line 6. Since the 'if' branch was not taken, the 'else' branch is taken (outcome 'Y').

Now, let's summarize the branch outcomes:

- Line 4: 'N' (n is not 1)
- Line 6: 'Y' (the else branch is taken)

The code will print 'NO' because 9 is not a power of 2.

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
8 
9
