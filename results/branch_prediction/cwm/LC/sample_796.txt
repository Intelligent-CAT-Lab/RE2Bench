<think>
The input parameters are str = "fnuiyh" and toget = "ni". The function checks if str starts with toget. 

At line 2, the condition is str.startswith(toget). The string "fnuiyh" does not start with "ni", so this condition evaluates to False. Therefore, the first branch (line 2) is not taken. 

Since the first branch is not taken, the else clause (line 3) is executed, and the branch at line 3 is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
