The function `f` takes an array and an index. Let's analyze the input given:
- array is [1]
- index is 0

Step by step execution:
1. The function starts by checking if the index is less than 0 at line 2.
2. The index provided is 0, which is not less than 0. Therefore, the condition at line 2 is false, and the branch is not taken.
3. Since the condition is false, the code does not execute the line that adjusts the index (line 3).
4. The function then proceeds to return the element at the given index (line 4). Since the index is 0 and the array has one element, it returns the first (and only) element of the array.

Therefore, the branch at line 2 is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
