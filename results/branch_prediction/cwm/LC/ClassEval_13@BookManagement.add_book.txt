The code defines a BookManagement class with methods to manage book inventory. To determine the branch outcomes for the given input, I'll trace the execution of the add_book method step by step.

The input to the add_book method is title="book2" and quantity defaults to 1 since it's not provided. The current inventory is {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}.

1. Check if "book2" is already in self.inventory. Since "book2" exists in the inventory, the condition (title in self.inventory) is true.
2. As the condition is true, the branch at line 9 (if title in self.inventory) is taken, so we append 'Y' to the taken list.
3. The code then executes the block under the if statement, which increments the quantity of "book2" by 1, making it 2.
4. Since the title was found, the else block (at line 11) is not executed, so we append 'N' to the taken list for that branch.

Therefore, the branch outcomes are 'Y' for the if condition and 'N' for the else condition.
