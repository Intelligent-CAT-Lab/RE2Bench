Let's step through the code with the given input "a\nkgf\nasd\n". 

1. Line 2: a = len(text). The text is "a\nkgf\nasd\n", which has 9 characters. So a = 9.
2. Line 3: count = 0. This initializes count to 0.
3. Line 4: while text: The loop runs as long as text is not empty. Initially, text is "a\nkgf\nasd\n", so the loop starts.

First iteration of the loop:
- Line 5: if text.startswith('a'). text is "a\nkgf\nasd\n", which starts with 'a', so this branch is taken (Y).
- Line 6: count += text.find(' '). text is "a\nkgf\nasd\n". The first space in this string is at position 2 (assuming '\n' is a newline character, but there are no spaces, so text.find(' ') returns -1. So count becomes 0 + (-1) = -1.
- Line 9: text = text[text.find('\n')+1:text.find('\n')+a+1]. The first '\n' is at position 1. So text becomes text[2:2+9+1] = text[2:12]. But the original text is "a\nkgf\nasd\n", which has length 9, so text[2:12] is "kgf\nasd\n".

Second iteration of the loop:
- Line 5: if text.startswith('a'). text is "kgf\nasd\n", which does not start with 'a', so this branch is not taken (N).
- Line 8: count += text.find('\n'). text is "kgf\nasd\n". The first '\n' is at position 3. So count becomes -1 + 3 = 2.
- Line 9: text = text[text.find('\n')+1:text.find('\n')+a+1]. The first '\n' is at position 3. So text becomes text[4:4+9+1] = text[4:14]. The original text is "kgf\nasd\n", which has length 7 (positions 0-6), so text[4:14] is "asd\n".

Third iteration of the loop:
- Line 5: if text.startswith('a'). text is "asd\n", which does not start with 'a', so this branch is not taken (N).
- Line 8: count += text.find('\n'). text is "asd\n". The first '\n' is at position 3. So count becomes 2 + 3 = 5.
- Line 9: text = text[text.find('\n')+1:text.find('\n')+a+1]. The first '\n' is at position 3. So text becomes text[4:4+9+1] = text[4:14]. The original text is "asd\n", which has length 4 (positions 0-3), so text[4:14] is an empty string.

The loop ends because text is now empty.

So the branches taken are [Y, N, N].

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     a = len(text)
3     count = 0
4     while text:
5         if text.startswith('a'): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,N,N][/BRANCH]
6             count += text.find(' ')
7         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,Y,Y][/BRANCH]
8             count += text.find('\n')
9         text = text[text.find('\n')+1:text.find('\n')+a+1]
10     return count
