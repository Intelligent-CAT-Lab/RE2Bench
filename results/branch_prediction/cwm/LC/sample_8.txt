The function `f` takes two parameters: `string` and `encryption`. The value of `string` is "UppEr" and `encryption` is 0. 

Looking at the code, the first line of execution is the conditional statement at line 2: `if encryption == 0:`. Since `encryption` is 0, this condition is True, and the code will execute the block under the `if` statement.

This means the branch at line 2 is taken ('Y'), and the branch at line 4 (the `else` clause) is not taken ('N').

The function returns the original `string` as specified in line 3. Since `string` is "UppEr", the function will return "UppEr" without any modifications.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
