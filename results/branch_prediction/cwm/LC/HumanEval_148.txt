The function takes two planet names as input and checks if they are valid and different. If not, it returns an empty tuple. If they are valid and different, it finds their indices in the list of planets and returns the planets in between them.

The input planets are both "Earth". Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Line 5: The condition checks if planet1 (Earth) is not in planet_names, or planet2 (Earth) is not in planet_names, or if planet1 == planet2. Since planet1 and planet2 are the same (Earth == Earth), this condition is true.
2. Line 6: Because the condition in line 5 is true, the function returns an empty tuple.

So, the branch at line 5 is taken (Y), and there is no need to evaluate the rest of the code.

8     planet2_index = planet_names.index(planet2)
9     if planet1_index < planet2_index:
10         return (planet_names[planet1_index + 1: planet2_index])
11     else:
12         return (planet_names[planet2_index + 1 : planet1_index])
