To simulate the execution of the `deposit` method with the given input, I will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the object `BankAccount` with `balance=0`.
2. Call the `deposit` method with `amount=300`.

Now, let's trace the code step by step:

- The method `deposit` is called with `amount=300`.
- The first line inside the method checks if `amount < 0`. Since `amount=300` is not less than 0, this condition is false, and the branch is not taken. So, I append 'N' to the list of branch outcomes.
- The next line adds `amount` to `self.balance`. Since `amount` is positive, this operation is valid.
- The final line returns the updated `balance`.

Therefore, the branch `if (amount < 0):` is not taken, resulting in the list `['N']`.
