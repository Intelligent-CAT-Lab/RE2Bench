Let's step through the code with the given input.

The input is "2.4", which will be split into a list ["2", "4"] on line 1.

Line 2 checks if the last character of the first element (num[0][-1]) is 9. num[0] is "2", so num[0][-1] is "2". The condition int("2") == 9 is False, so the branch is not taken.

Since the branch on line 2 is not taken, we proceed to the else clause on line 4.

On line 5, we check if the first character of the second element (num[1][0]) is greater than or equal to 5. num[1] is "4", so num[1][0] is "4". The condition int("4") >= 5 is False, so this branch is not taken.

Since the branch on line 5 is not taken, we proceed to the else clause on line 7 and print num[0], which is "2".

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
9
