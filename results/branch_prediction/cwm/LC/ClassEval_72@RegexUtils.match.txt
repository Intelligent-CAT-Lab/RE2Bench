Simulate the execution of RegexUtils.match with pattern "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b" and text "iustd87t2euhifg.com":

The pattern is an email address regex. The text "iustd87t2euhifg.com" lacks an "@" symbol and doesn't match the email pattern.

Step 1: re.match(pattern, text) is called.
This will return None because the text does not match the pattern.

Step 2: if ans: checks if ans is truthy (not None or False).
Since ans is None, this condition is False.

Step 3: else: is executed because the if condition was False.

So, the branches taken are:
- Line 8: 'N' (ans is None, condition is False)
- Line 10: 'Y' (else branch is taken)
