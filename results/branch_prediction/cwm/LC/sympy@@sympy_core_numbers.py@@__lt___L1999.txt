Okay, let's see. I need to determine whether the branch `if other.is_Integer:` in the `__lt__` method is taken when comparing 3 and 1. 

First, the method is called with `self` being 3 and `other` being 1. Since `self` is 3, which is an Integer, and `other` is 1, which is presumably also an Integer (given the context), I should check what `other.is_Integer` evaluates to.

Assuming that 1 is indeed an Integer, then `other.is_Integer` would be True. Therefore, the condition `if other.is_Integer:` would be True, and the branch would be taken. 

So, the branch is taken once, resulting in `taken=['Y']`.

[ANSWER]
11     def __lt__(self, other):
12         try:
13             other = _sympify(other)
14         except SympifyError:
15             return NotImplemented
16         if other.is_Integer: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
17             return _sympify(self.p < other.p)
18         return Rational.__lt__(self, other)
