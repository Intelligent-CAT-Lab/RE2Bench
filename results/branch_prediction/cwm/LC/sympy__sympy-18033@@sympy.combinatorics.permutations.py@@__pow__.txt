The method `__pow__` is called with the argument `n = -2`. 

The first line in the method checks if `n` is an instance of `Permutation`. Since `n` is an integer (-2), this condition is false, so the branch is not taken. The branch annotation for this line should be ['N'].

The next line converts `n` to an integer, which is already the case here, so no changes are needed.

Finally, the method returns the result of `_af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`. Since `self.array_form` is `None`, this will likely raise an error, but that's outside the scope of the branch annotation.

So, the branch annotation for the `if` statement should be ['N'].
