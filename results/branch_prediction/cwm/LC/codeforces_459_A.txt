Let's analyze the given Python code and the input to determine the branch outcomes.

The code is as follows:
1 anti, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
2 l = abs(anti - c); m = abs(b - d)
3 if anti == c: print(anti + m, b, c + m, d) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
4 elif b == d: print(anti, b + l, c, d + l) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5 elif l != m: print(-1) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
6 else: print(anti, d, c, b)

The input is: 3 4 7 8

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The input values are assigned to anti=3, b=4, c=7, d=8.
2. Calculate l = abs(3 - 7) = 4 and m = abs(4 - 8) = 4.
3. Check if anti == c: 3 == 7 is False, so this branch is not taken.
4. Check if b == d: 4 == 8 is False, so this branch is not taken.
5. Check if l != m: 4 != 4 is False, so this branch is not taken.
6. Since none of the above conditions are true, the else block is executed: print(3, 8, 7, 4).

Now, let's determine the branch outcomes:

- Branch at line 3: anti == c is False, so taken=['N'].
- Branch at line 4: b == d is False, so taken=['N'].
- Branch at line 5: l != m is False, so taken=['N'].

Therefore, the branch outcomes are ['N'], ['N'], and ['N'] respectively.

4 elif b == d: print(anti, b + l, c, d + l) ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5 elif l != m: print(-1) ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6 else: print(anti, d, c, b)
