<think>
The `heal` method is called on a `RPGCharacter` instance with `hp` initially set to 100. The method adds 10 to `self.hp`, making it 110. Then, it checks if `self.hp` is greater than 100. Since 110 > 100, the condition is true, and the branch is taken. Therefore, 'Y' should be appended to the branch annotation. The `hp` is then set back to 100.
