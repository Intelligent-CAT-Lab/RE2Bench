Let's analyze the given code and input to determine the branch outcomes for the `__eq__` method.

The `__eq__` method is defined in the `Model` class. It takes `self` and `other` as parameters. The method checks if `other` is an instance of `Model`. If not, it returns `NotImplemented`. Then, it checks if the concrete models of `self` and `other` are the same. If they are not, it returns `False`. 

In the given input, `other` is an instance of the same model as `self` (both have the same attributes and values). Therefore, the first condition `if not isinstance(other, Model):` will evaluate to `False`, and the branch will not be taken.

The second condition `if self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model:` will also evaluate to `False` because both `self` and `other` have the same concrete model.

The third condition `if my_pk is None:` will evaluate to `False` because `my_pk` (which is `self.pk`) is not `None` in the given input (it's `1`).

Therefore, the branch outcomes will be `['N', 'N', 'N']`.

54         if my_pk is None: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
55             return self is other
56         return my_pk == other.pk
