Let's break down the code execution step by step.

The input provided is "7 5 5".

Line 1: Just a line number marker, no code execution.

Line 2: ABC is assigned the result of tuple(map(int, input().split())). The input is split into ['7', '5', '5'], then mapped to integers, resulting in the tuple (7, 5, 5).

Line 3: The condition checks if ABC.count(5) == 2. The count of 5 in the tuple (7, 5, 5) is 2, so this condition evaluates to True. Therefore, the branch is taken (Y).

Line 4: Since the condition in line 3 was True, this line is executed. It prints 'YES' if sum(ABC) == 17, else 'NO'. The sum of ABC (7 + 5 + 5) is 17, so it prints 'YES'.

Line 5: This else clause is not executed because the condition in line 3 was True, so the branch is not taken (N).

Line 6: Not executed because the else clause was not entered.

Line 7: Just a line number marker, no code execution.

Line 8: Empty line, no code execution.

Now, let's determine the branch outcomes:

- The branch at line 3 is taken (Y) because ABC.count(5) == 2 is True.
- The else branch at line 5 is not taken (N) because the if condition was True.

[ANSWER]
1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
