I need to determine if the branch at line 2 is taken for the input "Hi there". Let's break it down step by step.

First, the string "Hi there" is converted to lowercase, resulting in "hi there". 

Next, I need to find the last index of 'i' in the string. The last occurrence of 'i' is at position 2.

Now, I have to check the condition at line 2: if the last index of 'h' before the last 'i' is greater than or equal to the last index of 'i'.

So, I search for the last index of 'h' before index 2. Since 'h' occurs at index 0 and 2 (in "hi there"), the rindex for 'h' will be 2 as well, because it's searching from the end and stops at the last occurrence of 'i' (index 2).

Therefore, the condition is true (2 >= 2), and the branch is taken, returning 'Hey'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(st):
2     if st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i'): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return 'Hey'
4     else:
5         return 'Hi'
