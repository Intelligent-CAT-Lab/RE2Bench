I need to determine how many times the branch at line 9 is taken (i.e., when counts[i] >= 3) for the given input.

The input is a list of integers: [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89].

Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. Line 2 initializes a list `counts` with 301 zeros. This is because the range of possible values for `i` in `ints` is from 0 to 300 (inclusive), as per the problem statement.

2. The first loop (lines 4-5) iterates over each integer in `ints` and increments the corresponding index in `counts`. 
   - For i=2: counts[2] becomes 1, then 2, then 3 (after the third occurrence of 2).
   - For i=3: counts[3] becomes 1.
   - For i=5: counts[5] becomes 1, then 2 (after the second occurrence of 5).
   - For i=4: counts[4] becomes 1.
   - For i=89: counts[89] becomes 1.

3. The second loop (lines 8-11) iterates over the indices of `counts` and checks if the count is >= 3. 
   - At i=2: counts[2] is 3, so the condition is true (branch taken).
   - For all other indices (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., 300), counts[i] is less than 3, so the condition is false (branch not taken).

Therefore, the branch at line 9 is taken exactly once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(ints):
2     counts = [0] * 301
3 
4     for i in ints:
5         counts[i] += 1
6 
7     r = []
8     for i in range(len(counts)):
9         if counts[i] >= 3: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10             r.append(str(i))
11     counts.clear()
12     return ' '.join(r)
