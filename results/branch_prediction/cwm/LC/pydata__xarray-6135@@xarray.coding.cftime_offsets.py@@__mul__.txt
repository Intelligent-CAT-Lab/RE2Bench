Let's break down the input and the code step by step.

The input to the `__mul__` method is:
- self: An instance of `QuarterOffset` with `n=1` and `month=2`.
- other: -1.

The `__mul__` method is defined as:

```python
def __mul__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, float): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return NotImplemented
    return type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)
```

First, the method checks if `other` is an instance of `float`. In this case, `other` is `-1`, which is an integer, not a float. So, the condition `isinstance(other, float)` evaluates to `False`.

Since the condition is `False`, the `if` branch is not taken, and the code proceeds to the `return` statement.

The `return` statement creates a new instance of the same type as `self` (which is `QuarterOffset`) with `n` set to `other * self.n` and `month` set to `self.month`. 

Here, `other * self.n` equals `-1 * 1`, which is `-1`. So, the new instance will have `n=-1` and `month=2`.

Therefore, the branch `isinstance(other, float)` is not taken, so the `taken` list should be `['N']`.

109         if isinstance(other, float): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
110             return NotImplemented
111         return type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month)
