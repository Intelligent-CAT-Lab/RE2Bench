Let's break down the given Python code and input step by step to determine how the branch is taken.

1. The input is "FFEE". 
2. The code starts by sorting this string. The sorted version of "FFEE" is ["E", "E", "F", "F"].
3. The code then checks if the first two characters are the same (s[0] == s[1]) and if the last two characters are the same (s[2] == s[3]), and also if the first character is different from the third character (s[0] != s[2]). 
   - Here, s[0] is "E", s[1] is "E", s[2] is "F", and s[3] is "F". 
   - So, s[0] == s[1] is True, s[2] == s[3] is True, and s[0] != s[2] is True.
4. Since all conditions in the if statement are True, the branch is taken, and it prints "Yes".

However, the problem specifies to determine the branch outcomes. The if statement's condition is met, so the first branch (the if branch) is taken, and the else branch is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 s = sorted ( input ( ) )
2 if s [ 0 ] == s [ 1 ] and s [ 2 ] == s [ 3 ] and s [ 0 ] != s [ 2 ] : print ( 'Yes' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3 else : print ( 'No' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
