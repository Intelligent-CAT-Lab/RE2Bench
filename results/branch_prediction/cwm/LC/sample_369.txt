Let's go through the function step by step with the input " 99 777".

1. The function checks if `var.isdigit()` at line 2. The input is " 99 777" which starts with a space, so it's not a digit. The condition is false, so this branch is not taken. The output for this branch is 'N'.

2. Next, at line 4, it checks if `var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit()`. Since there are no dots in " 99 777", this check fails because the string contains spaces. The condition is false, so this branch is not taken. The output for this branch is 'N'.

3. At line 6, it checks if `var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1`. Let's count the spaces and the length of the string. " 99 777" has 2 spaces. The length of the string is 7 (including spaces). So, `len(var) - 1` is 6. Since 2 is not equal to 6, this condition is false. The branch is not taken, so the output is 'N'.

4. At line 8, it checks if `len(var) == 1`. The length of " 99 777" is 7, so this condition is false. The branch is not taken, so the output is 'N'.

5. Since all previous conditions are false, the function proceeds to the `else` block at line 10. This branch is taken, so the output is 'Y'.

1 def f(var):
2     if var.isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         return "int"
4     elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return "float"
6     elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
7         return "str"
8     elif len(var) == 1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
9         return "char"
10     else:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
