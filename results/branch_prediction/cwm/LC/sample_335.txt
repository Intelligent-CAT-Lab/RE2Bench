Let's go step by step through the code execution with the given input.

Input:
- text = "sjbrlfqmw"
- to_remove = "l"

1. Line 1: The function `f` is defined with parameters `text` and `to_remove`.
2. Line 2: `new_text` is initialized as a list of characters from `text`. So, `new_text = ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'l', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w']`.
3. Line 3: The condition checks if `to_remove` (which is 'l') is in `new_text`. Since 'l' is present in the list, this condition is True.
4. Line 4: `index` is assigned the value of the first occurrence of 'l' in `new_text`. The index of 'l' is 4.
5. Line 5: The first occurrence of 'l' is removed from `new_text`, so `new_text` becomes ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w'].
6. Line 6: '?' is inserted at index 4 (the position where 'l' was removed). Now, `new_text` is ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', '?', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w'].
7. Line 7: The first occurrence of '?' is removed from `new_text`. Now, `new_text` is ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w'].
8. Line 8: The final `new_text` is joined back into a string and returned. The returned string is "sjbrfqmw".

Now, let's determine the branch outcomes:
- Line 3: The condition `if to_remove in new_text` is True, so the branch is taken. Therefore, the branch annotation should be `taken=['Y']`.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text, to_remove):
2     new_text = list(text)
3     if to_remove in new_text: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4         index = new_text.index(to_remove)
5         new_text.remove(to_remove)
6         new_text.insert(index, '?')
7         new_text.remove('?')
8     return ''.join(new_text)
