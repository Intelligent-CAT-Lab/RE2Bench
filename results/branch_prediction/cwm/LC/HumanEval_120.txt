Let's walk through the code step by step. The input to the `maximum` function is `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.

1. The function starts by checking if `k == 0` at line 4. Since `k` is 2, this condition is false, so the branch is not taken. Therefore, the `??` in the `taken` list becomes `['N']`.

2. The code then proceeds to sort the `arr` list. The original `arr` is `[-4, 4]`, and after sorting, it becomes `[-4, 4]`. 

3. Next, it assigns the last `k` elements of the sorted `arr` to the variable `ans`. Since `k` is 2 and the sorted array has two elements, `ans` becomes `[-4, 4]`.

4. Finally, the function returns `ans`.

So, the only branch in the code is at line 4, which is not taken. Thus, the `taken` list should be `['N']`.
