Let's analyze the code step by step for the input text "102x0zoq". 

The function f is designed to iterate through the input string in reverse order and append characters to the result if they are alphabetic.

1. The text is "102x0zoq", so the characters in reverse order are 'q', 'o', 'z', '0', 'x', '2', '0', '1'.
2. The loop starts at index 7 (the last character) and decrements i until it reaches -1.
3. For each character, it checks if the character is alphabetic using c.isalpha(). If true, it appends the character to result.

Now, let's go through each character:

- 'q': alphabetic → branch taken → result becomes 'q'
- 'o': alphabetic → branch taken → result becomes 'qo'
- 'z': alphabetic → branch taken → result becomes 'qoz'
- '0': not alphabetic → branch not taken
- 'x': alphabetic → branch taken → result becomes 'qozx'
- '2': not alphabetic → branch not taken
- '0': not alphabetic → branch not taken
- '1': not alphabetic → branch not taken

So, the branch at line 6 is taken 4 times (for 'q', 'o', 'z', 'x') and not taken 4 times (for '0', '2', '0', '1').

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     result = ''
3     i = len(text)-1
4     while i >= 0:
5         c = text[i]
6         if c.isalpha(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N][/BRANCH]
7             result += c
8         i -= 1
9     return result
