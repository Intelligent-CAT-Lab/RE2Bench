We are executing the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class with the following inputs:
- `self.table_name = "table1"`
- `fields` is not provided in `args`, but it's optional so it will default to `None`
- `kwargs` contains `condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`

Step-by-step analysis:
1. First, we check if `fields is None` (line 9). Since `fields` is not provided in `args`, it will be `None`, so this condition is true. We append 'Y'.
2. Since the first condition is true, the `else` block (line 11) is not executed. We append 'N' for this branch.
3. Next, we build the SQL string with `fields = '*'` and `self.table_name = "table1"`.
4. Then, we check if `condition is not None` (line 14). Since `condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"` is provided, this condition is true. We append 'Y'.
5. Finally, we append the condition to the SQL string and return the result.

So, the branch outcomes are:
- Line 9: 'Y' (fields is None)
- Line 11: 'N' (else block not taken)
- Line 14: 'Y' (condition is not None)
