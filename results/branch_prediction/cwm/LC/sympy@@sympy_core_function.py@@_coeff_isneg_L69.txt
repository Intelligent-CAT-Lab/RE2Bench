Let's analyze the input and the code step by step.

The input to the method `_coeff_isneg` is a mathematical expression: "cos(2*phi)/2". We need to determine whether this expression represents a negative coefficient.

1. The method first checks if the input `a` is of type `MatMul` (matrix multiplication). Since the input is "cos(2*phi)/2", which does not involve matrix multiplication, this condition is false. So, the branch taken is 'N'.

2. Next, the method checks if `a` is of type `Mul` (multiplication). The input expression involves multiplication (2*phi), but we need to check if `a` is a `Mul` object. Since "cos(2*phi)/2" is not a simple multiplication but a division of a cosine function by 2, this condition is also false. Therefore, the branch taken is 'N'.

3. Finally, the method checks if `a` is a number and if it is an extended negative number. Since "cos(2*phi)/2" is not a number but a trigonometric expression, this condition is false.

So, the branches taken are 'N', 'N', and the final return statement will evaluate to false.
