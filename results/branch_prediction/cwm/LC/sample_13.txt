The function `f` takes a list of names and counts how many of them are alphabetic strings. Let's break down the code step by step with the given input.

Input:
names = ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]

Step 1: Line 2 initializes `count` with the length of `names`, which is 3. However, this variable isn't used later in the code.

Step 2: Line 3 initializes `numberOfNames` to 0. This variable will track how many names are entirely alphabetic.

Step 3: The for loop starts at line 4, iterating over each name in `names`.

First iteration (i = "sharron"):
- Line 5 checks if "sharron".isalpha(). Since all characters in "sharron" are alphabetic, this returns True.
- Therefore, the branch is taken (Y), and `numberOfNames` increments by 1 (now 1).

Second iteration (i = "Savannah"):
- Line 5 checks if "Savannah".isalpha(). Since all characters in "Savannah" are alphabetic, this returns True.
- The branch is taken (Y), and `numberOfNames` increments by 1 (now 2).

Third iteration (i = "Mike Cherokee"):
- Line 5 checks if "Mike Cherokee".isalpha(). The string contains a space, which is not an alphabetic character.
- Therefore, "Mike Cherokee".isalpha() returns False.
- The branch is not taken (N), and `numberOfNames` remains 2.

Step 4: After the loop, line 7 returns `numberOfNames`, which is 2.

So, the branch at line 5 is taken twice (for "sharron" and "Savannah") and not taken once (for "Mike Cherokee").

[ANSWER]
1 def f(names):
2     count = len(names)
3     numberOfNames = 0
4     for i in names:
5         if i.isalpha(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,Y,N][/BRANCH]
6             numberOfNames += 1
7     return numberOfNames
