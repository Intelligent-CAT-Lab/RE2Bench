The input is ".NET". Let's step through the function f with this input.

1. The function starts by initializing `new_name` as an empty string.
2. The input `name` is reversed, so ".NET" becomes "TEN.".
3. The loop runs for the length of the reversed name, which is 4.
   
   - Iteration 1 (i=0):
     - `n` is 'T'.
     - Since 'T' is not '.' and `new_name` has 0 '.'s, the condition is true.
     - 'T' is added to `new_name`, which becomes 'T'.
   
   - Iteration 2 (i=1):
     - `n` is 'E'.
     - Since 'E' is not '.' and `new_name` still has 0 '.'s, the condition is true.
     - 'E' is added to `new_name`, which becomes 'ET'.
   
   - Iteration 3 (i=2):
     - `n` is 'N'.
     - Since 'N' is not '.' and `new_name` still has 0 '.'s, the condition is true.
     - 'N' is added to `new_name`, which becomes 'NET'.
   
   - Iteration 4 (i=3):
     - `n` is '.'.
     - Since '.' is '.', the condition is false, so the loop breaks.

Therefore, the branches taken are:
- Line 6: ['Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N']
- Line 8: ['N', 'N', 'N', 'Y']

[ANSWER]
1 def f(name):
2     new_name =''
3     name = name[::-1]
4     for i in range(len(name)):
5         n = name[i]
6         if n !='.' and  new_name.count('.')<2: ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y','Y','Y','N'][/BRANCH]
7             new_name=n+new_name
8         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N','N','N','Y'][/BRANCH]
9             break
10     return new_name
