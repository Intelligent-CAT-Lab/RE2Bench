The function starts_one_ends takes an integer n as input. The first line checks if n equals 1. If true, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates 18 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of (n - 2).

Given the input n = 5, the first condition (n == 1) is false because 5 is not equal to 1. Therefore, the branch at line 4 is not taken, and the function proceeds to line 5, where it calculates 18 * (10 ** (5 - 2)).
