Okay, so I need to figure out whether the branch on line 3 is taken when the method _interval_contains_close is called with the given inputs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the method is given an interval (which is an array [0., 2.]), a value (array(0.)), and an rtol of 1e-10. The method starts by unpacking the interval into a and b. Then it checks if a > b. If that's true, it swaps them. So the question is: in this case, is a (0.0) greater than b (2.0)?

No, 0.0 is not greater than 2.0. So the condition a > b is false. That means the branch (line 3) is not taken. Therefore, the code will not swap a and b.

Wait, but what if the interval is given in reverse order? Like if someone passes (2.0, 0.0)? But in this specific case, the interval is [0., 2.], so a is 0.0 and b is 2.0. So the condition a > b is definitely false. So the branch is not taken. 

Therefore, the branch taken should be ['N'].

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
7
