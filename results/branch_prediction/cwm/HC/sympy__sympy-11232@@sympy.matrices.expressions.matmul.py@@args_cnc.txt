To determine the branch outcomes, let's start by understanding what the `args_cnc` method does. It appears to separate the coefficients and matrices from the arguments of a `MatMul` object.

Given the input to the `args_cnc` method:
- `self.args` is `["2", "A", "B"]`, where `"2"` is a scalar and `"A"`, `"B"` are matrices.

First, the method calls `self.as_coeff_matrices()` to separate the coefficients (scalars) and matrices. In this case, `scalars` will be `["2"]` and `matrices` will be `["A", "B"]`.

Next, it calculates `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc` by calling `coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)`. Since `coeff` is `Mul(*scalars)` and `scalars` is `["2"]`, `coeff` is essentially `2`. The `args_cnc` method of `Mul` would return `([2], [])` for `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc` respectively.

Now, the code checks if `coeff_c == [1]`. Since `coeff_c` is `[2]`, this condition is not met, so this branch is not taken.

Then, it checks if `coeff_c == set([1])`. Again, since `coeff_c` is `[2]`, this condition is also not met, so this branch is not taken either.

Therefore, the branches are not taken, and the final return statement is executed with the original `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc + matrices`.
