Let's go through the code step by step to determine which branches are taken.

The method `prepare_url` is called with `url="http://127.0.0.1:10000//v:h"` and `params={}`.

1. The first check is if the `url` is of type `bytes`. Since it's a string, this branch is not taken → ['N'].
2. The `else` branch converts the `url` to a string, which it already is, so this branch is taken → ['Y'].
3. The `url` is stripped of leading whitespace, but since there are none, this doesn't change anything.
4. The code checks if the `url` contains a colon but does not start with 'http'. Since it starts with 'http', this condition is false → ['N'].
5. The `url` is parsed into its components using `parse_url`. This succeeds, so no exception is raised.
6. The scheme is checked. Since 'http' is present, this condition is false → ['N'].
7. The host is checked. '127.0.0.1' is present, so this condition is false → ['N'].
8. The host is checked to see if it contains non-ASCII characters. Since '127.0.0.1' is all ASCII, this condition is false → ['N'].
9. The host is checked to see if it starts with '*' or '.'. Since it doesn't, this condition is false → ['N'].
10. The netloc is constructed. Since there's no auth, it's just the host. The port is present, so it's added → ['Y'].
11. The path is checked. Since '//v:h' is present, this condition is false → ['N'].
12. The params are checked. Since they're an empty dictionary, this condition is false → ['N'].
13. The encoded params are checked. Since they're empty, this condition is false → ['N'].

So, the branches taken are: ['N', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'N'].
