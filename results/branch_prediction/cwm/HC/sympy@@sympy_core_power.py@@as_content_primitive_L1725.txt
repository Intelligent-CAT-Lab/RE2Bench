In the method as_content_primitive for the Pow instance sqrt(2) (i.e., b=2, e=1/2), the first conditional checks if b is a rational number with a numerator equal to 1 and a denominator not equal to 1. Here, b is 2 (an Integer), so this condition is not taken → ['N'].

Next, the code proceeds to handle the content and primitive parts. Since b is an Integer and not a Rational, the second conditional (checking if b is Rational) is not taken → ['N'].

Finally, the code checks if e is Rational (which it is, e=1/2) and if b is a Mul (which it is not, b=2). Therefore, this condition is not taken either → ['N'].

Putting this all together, the branches taken are:
1. The first conditional (b.is_Rational and b.p == 1 and (b.q != 1)) is not taken → ['N'].
2. The second conditional (b.is_Rational) is not taken → ['N'].
3. The third conditional (e.is_Rational and b.is_Mul) is not taken → ['N'].
