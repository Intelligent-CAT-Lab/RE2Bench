I will examine the provided code and the given input to determine the branch outcomes.

1. The code defines a class `BboxBase` with a method `splitx`. This method calculates and returns a list of `Bbox` objects based on the `args` passed to it.
2. The `args` are two values, both `0.85`, indicating potential split points along the x-axis.
3. The `splitx` method first creates a list `xf` by inserting the given `args` (after the initial `0`) and appending `1` at the end. This gives `xf = [0, 0.85, 0.85, 1]`.
4. It then extracts the x and y coordinates of the bounding box extents (`x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1`) from the `extents` property. Here, `x0 = 0.125`, `y0 = 0.1`, `x1 = 0.9`, `y1 = 0.9`.
5. The width `w` of the bounding box is calculated as `x1 - x0 = 0.9 - 0.125 = 0.775`.
6. The list comprehension then generates new `Bbox` objects for each pair of consecutive values in `xf`. The pairs are `(0, 0.85)`, `(0.85, 0.85)`, and `(0.85, 1)`.
7. For each pair `(xf0, xf1)`, it calculates the new x-coordinates as `x0 + xf0 * w` and `x0 + xf1 * w`, keeping the y-coordinates constant (`y0` and `y1`).

However, I don't see any conditional statements in the `splitx` method that could lead to branching. The code seems to execute sequentially without any conditionals. Therefore, there are no branches to annotate.

But wait, let's re-examine the code again. I see that there is a method `_check` which contains a conditional statement. Let's investigate that.

The `_check` method is a static method that checks if the points are a masked array or if the bbox is singular. However, this method is not called in the `splitx` method. It's possible that this method is called elsewhere in the code, but based on the provided code snippet, we can't determine that.

Given the information provided, I can conclude that there are no branches in the `splitx` method that need to be annotated.

However, the question asks to complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N". Since there are no branches in the `splitx` method, I will focus on the `_check` method.

In the `_check` method, there is a conditional statement that checks if the points are a masked array. Since we don't have the actual points, we can't determine if this branch is taken or not. But let's assume that the points are not a masked array, so the branch is not taken.

Therefore, the branch annotation for the `_check` method would be `taken=[N]`.

But again, this method is not called in the `splitx` method, so it's not directly relevant to the question.

Given the provided code snippet and the input, I can conclude that there are no branches in the `splitx` method that need to be annotated.

However, the question asks to complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N". Since there are no branches in the `splitx` method, I will leave the annotation as is.
