[THOUGHT]
The input is "1", so:
- Line 1: x = int("1") → x = 1
- Line 2: if x == 1 → True → branch taken (Y)
- Line 3: print(0)
- Line 4: else branch not taken because the if was taken (N)
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
