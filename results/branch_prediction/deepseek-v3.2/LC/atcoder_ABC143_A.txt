[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step by step.

1. Line 1: A, B = map(int, input().split())
   Input is "20 30"
   So A = 20, B = 30.

2. Line 2: ans = A - 2 * B
   ans = 20 - 2 * 30 = 20 - 60 = -40.

3. Line 3: if ans < 0:
   ans is -40, so -40 < 0 is True.
   The branch is taken.

4. Line 4: ans = 0 (since branch was taken)

5. Line 5: print(ans) prints 0.

So the branch at line 3 is encountered once and taken ('Y').

Therefore, taken=['Y'].

[ANSWER]
1 A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 ans = A - 2 * B
3 if ans < 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
4     ans = 0
5 print ( ans )
6 
7
