[THOUGHT]
We have the function f with parameters string="UppEr" and encryption=0.

Let's trace step by step:
- Line 2: Check if encryption == 0. Since encryption = 0, the condition is True, so the branch is taken (enter the if block).
- Line 3: Return string immediately, so the rest of the function is not executed.
- Line 4: else branch is not taken because the if condition was True.

So outcomes:
- Line 2 branch taken once: Y
- Line 4 branch not taken once: N

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
