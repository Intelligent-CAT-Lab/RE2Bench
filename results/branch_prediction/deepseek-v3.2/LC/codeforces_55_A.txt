[THOUGHT]
Input is 9.
n = int(input()) → n = 9.
while n % 2 == 0: 9 % 2 = 1, condition false, so loop is skipped.
Then line 4: if n == 1: n is 9, so condition false → branch not taken.
Since the if branch is not taken, the else branch (line 6) is taken.
Thus, for line 4: taken? → N (once).
For line 6: taken? → Y (once).

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )
8 
9
