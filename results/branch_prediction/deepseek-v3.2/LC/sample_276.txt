[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code with input a = [0].

Line 2 condition: len(a) >= 2 and a[0] > 0 and a[1] > 0
- len(a) = 1, so len(a) >= 2 is False
- The whole condition uses short-circuit evaluation, so once the first part is False, the rest isn't evaluated
- The branch condition is overall False, so the branch is not taken

The branch is only encountered once, so we have a single 'N'.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(a):
2     if len(a) >= 2 and a[0] > 0 and a[1] > 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         a.reverse()
4         return a
5     a.append(0)
6     return a
