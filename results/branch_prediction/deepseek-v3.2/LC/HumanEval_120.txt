[THOUGHT]
We need to trace the execution for arr = [-4, 4], k = 2.

Line 4: if k == 0:
k = 2, so condition is False → branch NOT taken.
No other branch points in this code.
Therefore, branch at line 4 is encountered once and not taken → taken = ['N'].
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def maximum(arr, k):
2 
3     if k == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         return []
5     arr.sort()
6     ans = arr[-k:]
7     return ans
8
