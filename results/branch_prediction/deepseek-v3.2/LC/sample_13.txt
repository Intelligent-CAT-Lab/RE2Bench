[THOUGHT]
We have the input:
names = ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]

We iterate through each string in the list:

1. i = "sharron"
   i.isalpha() checks if all characters are alphabetic. "sharron" contains only letters → True → branch taken.

2. i = "Savannah"
   "Savannah" contains only letters → True → branch taken.

3. i = "Mike Cherokee"
   This string contains a space between "Mike" and "Cherokee". 
   .isalpha() returns True only if all characters are alphabetic and there is at least one character. Space is not alphabetic → False → branch not taken.

So at line 5, each iteration's branch outcome:
Iteration 1: Y
Iteration 2: Y
Iteration 3: N

Thus taken = ['Y', 'Y', 'N'].

1 def f(names):
2     count = len(names)
3     numberOfNames = 0
4     for i in names:
5         if i.isalpha(): ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y','Y','N'][/BRANCH]
6             numberOfNames += 1
7     return numberOfNames
