[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of the `due` method with the given input:
- The `self` object has an attribute `promotion` which is set to a function (as indicated by the string representation). Therefore, `self.promotion is None` evaluates to False.
- The branch at line 12 (if condition) is not taken → append 'N'.
- The else branch at line 14 is taken → append 'Y'.
Thus, the branch outcomes are single characters: 'N' for line 12, 'Y' for line 14.
