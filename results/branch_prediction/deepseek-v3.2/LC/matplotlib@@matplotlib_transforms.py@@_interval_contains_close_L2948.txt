[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step-by-step:

1. The function is called with:
   - interval = array([0., 2.])
   - val = array(0.)
   - rtol = 1e-10

2. Line 2: a, b = interval → a = 0.0, b = 2.0

3. Line 3: if a > b → 0.0 > 2.0 is False

4. The branch at line 3 is encountered once and not taken.

So the branch annotation should be ['N'] for the single encounter.

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
7
