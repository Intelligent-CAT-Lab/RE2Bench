[THOUGHT]
Simulate the execution of get_gpa with name="Charlie":
- Check condition on line 9: (name in self.students) and self.students[name]['courses']
  - name = "Charlie" is in self.students, so first part is True.
  - self.students["Charlie"]['courses'] is a non-empty dictionary (has keys "Chemistry" and "Physics"), so it evaluates to True.
  - Therefore, the entire condition is True, so the if branch is taken (line 10) and the else branch (line 11-12) is not taken.
- Thus, for the branch on line 9, we record 'Y' (taken).
- For the branch on line 11, we record 'N' (not taken).
Each branch point is encountered exactly once during this execution.
