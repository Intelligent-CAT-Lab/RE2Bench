[THOUGHT]
We need to trace execution of the given code:

1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev = p - 1
3     if prev < 0: prev = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev]

Input:
nums = [6, 8, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]
p = 6

Step-by-step:
Line 2: prev = p - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
Line 3: if prev < 0: prev is 5, 5 < 0? False. So branch NOT taken.
Thus branch taken = 'N'.

Only one branch point encountered, so list is ['N'].

1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev = p - 1
3     if prev < 0: prev = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev]
