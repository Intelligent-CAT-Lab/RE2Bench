[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code with the input "1 1000000000".

1. `a, b = map(int, input().split())` → a = 1, b = 1000000000.

2. First branch condition: `if a <= 0 and 0 <= b`  
   a = 1, so a <= 0 is False.  
   b = 1,000,000,000, so 0 <= b is True.  
   False and True → False → branch not taken.  
   So first branch: `taken=[N]`.

3. Second branch condition: `elif a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0`  
   a = 1, so a < 0 is False.  
   Since first condition is False, entire `elif` is not evaluated, so branch not taken.  
   So second branch: `taken=[N]`.

4. Third branch: `else:`  
   Since neither `if` nor `elif` is taken, else is executed.  
   So third branch: `taken=[Y]`.

Each branch is only encountered once, so the lists have one element each.

[ANSWER]
1 a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 if a <= 0 and 0 <= b : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "Zero" )
4 elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( "Negative" )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( "Positive" )
