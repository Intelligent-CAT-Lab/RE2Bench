[THOUGHT]
We are to predict branch outcomes for largest_divisor(3). Let's trace:

Line 5: for i in reversed(range(n)). n=3, range(3) is 0,1,2. reversed gives [2,1,0].

Loop iteration 1: i = 2.
Line 6: if n % i == 0 → 3 % 2 == 0? 3 % 2 = 1, so condition is False → branch not taken, so append 'N'.

Loop iteration 2: i = 1.
Line 6: if 3 % 1 == 0? 3 % 1 = 0, condition True → branch taken, append 'Y'. Then return i (1). Loop ends.

So branch encounters: first at i=2 → N, then at i=1 → Y. i=0 is never reached because loop ends after return.

Thus branch outcomes list is ['N', 'Y'].

[ANSWER]
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:

    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N','Y'][/BRANCH]
            return i
