[THOUGHT]  
Let's trace through the code step-by-step with input "7 5 5".  

Line 2: `input().split()` returns `['7', '5', '5']`.  
`map(int, ...)` makes it `[7, 5, 5]`.  
`tuple(...)` makes it `(7, 5, 5)`.  

Line 3: `ABC.count(5)` counts how many times 5 appears in the tuple.  
In `(7, 5, 5)`, `count(5)` is 2, so `ABC.count(5) == 2` is `True`.  
Therefore, branch taken (Y) at line 3, and we go into the `if` block.  

Line 4: `sum(ABC)` is 7 + 5 + 5 = 17.  
`sum(ABC) == 17` is `True`, so `'YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO'` evaluates to `'YES'`.  
We print `'YES'`.  

Line 5 (`else`) is not executed because the `if` condition was true, so branch not taken (N).  

Thus:  
Line 3 branch: taken once → `taken=Y`.  
Line 5 branch: not taken once → `taken=N`.

[ANSWER]
1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
