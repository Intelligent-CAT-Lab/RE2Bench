[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step by step.

Function `f(items, target)`:
- Line 2 checks if `target in items`. 
- Input: `items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`, `target = "**"`
- Checking membership: "**" is at index 3 of items → condition is True.
- So branch at line 2 is taken → 'Y'.
- Line 3: `return items.index(target)` returns 3 and function ends.

So branch encountered once, taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
