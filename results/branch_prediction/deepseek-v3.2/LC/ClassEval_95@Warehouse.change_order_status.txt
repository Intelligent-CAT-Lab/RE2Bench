[THOUGHT]
We are simulating the method change_order_status with the given input. The self.orders dictionary has key "1" (string), while the order_id argument is 1 (integer). The condition `order_id in self.orders` checks if the integer 1 is a key in the dictionary. Since the keys are strings, this evaluates to False. Therefore, the if branch on line 10 is not taken, and we append 'N'. Consequently, the else branch on line 12 is taken, so we append 'Y'.
