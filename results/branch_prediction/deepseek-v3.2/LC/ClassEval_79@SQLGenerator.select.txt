[THOUGHT]
I need to trace the execution of the `select` method with the given input. The input is:
- self.table_name = "table1"
- args is empty (no positional arguments)
- kwargs has one key: "condition": "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"

The method signature is `select(self, fields=None, condition=None)`. When called with only kwargs having "condition", the parameters will be:
- fields = None (default)
- condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"

Now step through:
1. Line 9: Check `if (fields is None)`. fields is None → branch taken → 'Y'
2. Line 10: Execute fields = '*'
3. Line 11: else branch is not taken because the if was taken → 'N'
4. Line 13: Build sql = 'SELECT * FROM table1'
5. Line 14: Check `if (condition is not None)`. condition is "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", not None → branch taken → 'Y'
6. Line 15: Append WHERE condition to sql
7. Line 16: Return sql + ';'

So branch outcomes:
- Line 9: ['Y']
- Line 11: ['N']
- Line 14: ['Y']
