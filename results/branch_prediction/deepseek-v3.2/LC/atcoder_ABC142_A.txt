[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step by step with the given input:

1. `N = int(input())` → The input is "99" (given), so N = 99.
2. Check `if N % 2 == 0`:
   - 99 % 2 = 1, so condition is False.
   - Branch NOT taken at line 2.
3. Since the `if` branch is not taken, we go to the `else` branch (line 4).
   - The `else` branch IS taken.

So for line 2, "taken" should be N.
For line 4, "taken" should be Y.

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
