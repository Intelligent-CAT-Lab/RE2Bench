Let's trace through the code step-by-step:

1. The function `interval_contains` is called with:
   - interval = array([-107.73502692, -7.73502692])
   - val = -80.0

2. Line 2: `a, b = interval` → a = -107.73502692, b = -7.73502692

3. Line 3: Check `if a > b`: 
   - a = -107.73502692, b = -7.73502692
   - -107.73502692 > -7.73502692? No (negative numbers: -107.7 is less than -7.7)
   - So the condition is False → branch NOT taken

4. Line 5: Return `a <= val <= b`:
   - a = -107.73502692, val = -80.0, b = -7.73502692
   - -107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692? 
     First comparison: -107.7 <= -80.0 → True
     Second: -80.0 <= -7.7 → True
     So returns True

The branch at line 3 is encountered exactly once during execution, and it is NOT taken. So `taken=['N']`.

1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
