[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of remove_item with:
- self.items = {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 4}}
- item = "apple"
- quantity = 1 (default)

Line 9: if (item in self.items): Check if "apple" is in self.items. Yes, it is, so this branch is taken → append 'Y'.
Line 10: self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity → quantity becomes 3.
Line 11: else: This branch is not taken because the if condition was true → append 'N'.
Only one execution path, so each branch is encountered once.
