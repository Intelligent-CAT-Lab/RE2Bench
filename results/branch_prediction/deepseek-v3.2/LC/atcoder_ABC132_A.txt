The input is "FFEE".  
Line 1: `s = sorted(input())` → sorted('F','F','E','E') → ['E','E','F','F']  
Line 2: Condition:  
- `s[0] == s[1]` → 'E' == 'E' → True  
- `s[2] == s[3]` → 'F' == 'F' → True  
- `s[0] != s[2]` → 'E' != 'F' → True  
All three subconditions are True, so the whole `if` condition is True, meaning the branch is taken (print 'Yes').  
That means the first branch is taken once, so `taken=['Y']`.  
The else branch is not taken, so `taken=['N']`.

[ANSWER]
1 s = sorted ( input ( ) )
2 if s [ 0 ] == s [ 1 ] and s [ 2 ] == s [ 3 ] and s [ 0 ] != s [ 2 ] : print ( 'Yes' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3 else : print ( 'No' ) ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
