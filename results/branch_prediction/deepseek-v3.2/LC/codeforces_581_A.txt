[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code step-by-step with input "1 1".

1. `input()` reads the string "1 1".
2. `.split()` splits it into `['1', '1']`.
3. `list(...)` makes a list `['1', '1']`, stored in `x`.
4. Loop `for i in range(len(x)):` → `range(2)` → `i = 0`, then `i = 1`.
   - `i = 0`: `x[0] = int('1')` → `x = [1, 1]`
   - `i = 1`: `x[1] = int('1')` → `x = [1, 1]`
5. `a = x[0]` → `a = 1`
6. `b = x[1]` → `b = 1`
7. `print(min(x), end=" ")` → `min([1, 1]) = 1` → prints `1 `.
8. Line 7: `if abs(a - b) >= 2:` → `abs(1 - 1) = 0` → `0 >= 2` is False, so the branch is NOT taken.
9. Line 9: `else:` → Since the `if` condition was False, the `else` branch is taken.

Each branch is encountered once during execution. The first branch (`if abs(...) >= 2`) is not taken (`N`), and the second branch (`else`) is taken (`Y`).

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
