[THOUGHT]
We need to trace the execution of `is_simple_power` with input `x=1`, `n=1`.

Line 4: `if (n == 1)`. Here `n=1`, so condition is true. Branch taken → append 'Y'.
Line 5: returns `(x == 1)`. Since `x=1`, it returns `True`. The rest of the function after line 5 is not executed.

So the branch at line 4 is taken once.

1 
2 def is_simple_power(x, n):
3 
4     if (n == 1): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5         return (x == 1)
6     power = 1
7     while (power < x):
8         power = power * n
9     return (power == x)
10
