[THOUGHT]  
We need to trace the execution of `is_palindrome("xywzx")`.  
- `len(text) = 5`, so `range(5)` gives i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.  
- Condition at line 6: `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.  

We test:  
i = 0: `text[0] = 'x'`, `text[4] = 'x'` → equal → condition False → branch not taken.  
i = 1: `text[1] = 'y'`, `text[3] = 'z'` → 'y' != 'z' → condition True → branch taken → return False → function stops.  

So only one branch encounter, at i=0 it's `'N'`, at i=1 it's `'Y'`, and after that loop stops because function returns.  

Thus the sequence of taken/not taken for the branch is ['N', 'Y'].

1 def is_palindrome(text: str):
2 
3     for i in range(len(text)):
4         if text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N','Y'][/BRANCH]
5             return False
6     return True
