[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with array=[6,2,7,1] and elem=6. At line 2, the condition "elem in array" is evaluated. Since 6 is in the list, the condition is True, so the branch is taken. The branch point is encountered only once during execution. Therefore, the branch outcome is 'Y'.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
[/ANSWER]
