The input list is: [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]  
Line 2 creates `counts` of length 301 all zeros.  
Lines 4–5 count frequencies:  

- i=2 → counts[2] becomes 1 → 2 → 3 (three times)  
- i=3 → counts[3] = 1  
- i=5 → counts[5] = 1 → 2 (twice)  
- i=4 → counts[4] = 1  
- i=89 → counts[89] = 1  

So counts[2] = 3, counts[3] = 1, counts[4] = 1, counts[5] = 2, counts[89] = 1, others 0.  

Lines 8–10 loop i from 0 to 300 inclusive.  
The branch condition `counts[i] >= 3` is only true when i = 2 (because counts[2] = 3).  
All other i from 0..300 have counts[i] < 3.  

Therefore:  

- For i=0..1 → N  
- i=2 → Y  
- i=3..300 → N  

That's 301 total loop iterations, only one branch taken at i=2.  

Sequence: first 3 iterations i=0,1,2 → N, N, Y; then from i=3..300 all N (298 times).  

So total list length: 301 entries.

10             r.append(str(i))  
11     counts.clear()  
12     return ' '.join(r)
