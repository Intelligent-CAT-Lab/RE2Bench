[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution step by step.

Given input:
array = [1]
index = 0

At line 2: if index < 0:
index = 0, so 0 < 0 is False. Therefore the branch is NOT taken.
The condition is evaluated only once, so we have one outcome: N.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
