We need to trace the execution for input: x=2, y=1, z=1.

Line 5: if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int):
x=2 is int, y=1 is int, z=1 is int → all True → condition True → branch taken (Y).

Line 6: if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x):
Compute each:
x+y = 2+1 = 3, compare to z=1 → 3==1 False.
x+z = 2+1 = 3, compare to y=1 → 3==1 False.
y+z = 1+1 = 2, compare to x=2 → 2==2 True.
Since one is True (y+z==x), overall condition True → branch taken (Y).

Then return True at line 7, no further branch encounters.

So for line 5: taken=Y (once).
Line 6: taken=Y (once).
