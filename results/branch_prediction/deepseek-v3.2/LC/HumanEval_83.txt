[THOUGHT]
The function `starts_one_ends` is called with `n = 5`.  
At line 4, there's a condition: `if n == 1`.  
Since `n = 5`, this condition is false, so the branch is **not taken**.  
Therefore, `taken=` should be `[N]`.

[ANSWER]
1 def starts_one_ends(n):
2 
3     if n == 1: return 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))
5
