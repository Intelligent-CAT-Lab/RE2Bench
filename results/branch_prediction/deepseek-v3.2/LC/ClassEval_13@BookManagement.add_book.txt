[THOUGHT]
We are given an input for the method `add_book` of class `BookManagement`. The inventory is {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}, and the title argument is "book2". The method `add_book` is called with title="book2" and quantity defaulting to 1.

Execution:
- Line 9: Check if title in self.inventory. Since "book2" is a key in the inventory, the condition is True. Therefore, the branch is taken. We record 'Y' for this occurrence.
- Because the if branch is taken, we execute line 10: self.inventory["book2"] += 1, increasing its quantity to 2.
- Then we skip the else branch (line 11-12). So the else branch is not taken. We record 'N' for that branch point.

Thus, the branch outcomes: for the if branch: ['Y']; for the else branch: ['N'].
