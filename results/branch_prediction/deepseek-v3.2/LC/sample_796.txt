[THOUGHT]
We are given:
- str = "fnuiyh"
- toget = "ni"

We need to execute the function f(str, toget).

Line 2: if str.startswith(toget)
str.startswith(toget) checks if "fnuiyh" starts with "ni". 
"fnuiyh" starts with "f", not "n", so this returns False.
Therefore the branch at line 2 is NOT taken (N).
Since the if condition is false, we go to the else branch at line 3.
The else branch returns str. That branch is taken (Y).

The function will be called only once, so each branch is encountered exactly once.
Thus:
Line 2: taken=N
Line 3: taken=Y

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
