[THOUGHT]
We need to trace the execution of `_mac_arch` with the given input:
- `arch` = "x86_64"
- `is_32bit` = true

Line 2: `if not is_32bit:`  
`is_32bit` is true, so `not true` is false → the branch is **not taken** → 'N'.

Since the condition is false, we skip line 3 and go to line 5.

Line 5: `if arch.startswith("ppc"):`  
`arch` is "x86_64", which does not start with "ppc" → false → the branch is **not taken** → 'N'.

Then we go to line 8 and return "i386".

Thus, for each branch point encountered once during execution:  
Line 2: taken='N'  
Line 5: taken='N'  
We output lists with single elements, as each branch is only encountered once.

1 def _mac_arch(arch: str, is_32bit: bool = _32_BIT_INTERPRETER) -> str:
2     if not is_32bit: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         return arch
4 
5     if arch.startswith("ppc"): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         return "ppc"
7 
8     return "i386"
9
