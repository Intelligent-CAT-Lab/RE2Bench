[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the code with input "2.4":

1. num = input().split(".") → "2.4".split(".") → ["2", "4"]
   So num[0] = "2", num[1] = "4"

2. Line 2: if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:
   num[0] = "2", num[0][-1] = "2", int("2") == 9 → False
   So this branch is NOT taken. We record 'N' for first branch.

3. Since the if condition is false, we go to the else branch at line 4.
   So the else branch (line 4) IS taken. We record 'Y' for second branch.

4. Now inside the else block:
   Line 5: if int(num[1][0]) >= 5:
   num[1] = "4", num[1][0] = "4", int("4") >= 5 → False
   So this branch is NOT taken. We record 'N' for third branch.

5. Since the if condition at line 5 is false, we go to the else branch at line 7.
   So the else branch (line 7) IS taken. We record 'Y' for fourth branch.

6. The program prints num[0] which is "2".

[ANSWER]
1 num = input ( ) . split ( "." )
2 if int ( num [ 0 ] [ - 1 ] ) == 9 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3     print ( "GOTO ▁ Vasilisa ." )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
5     if int ( num [ 1 ] [ 0 ] ) >= 5 : ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
6         print (f"{int ( num [ 0 ] ) + 1}" )
7     else : ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
8         print ( num [ 0 ] )
