[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

We have an instance of CurrencyConverter with self.rates as shown in the input. The method update_currency_rate is called with:
- currency = "CNY"
- new_rate = 7.18

Line 9: if (currency not in self.rates): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
We check if "CNY" is not in self.rates.
Looking at self.rates from the input: it contains "CNY": 7.18.
So "CNY" is in self.rates, so currency not in self.rates is False.
Therefore, the branch is not taken → append 'N'.

The condition fails, so we skip line 10 and go to line 11: self.rates[currency] = new_rate.
Then the method implicitly returns None (no explicit return).

Thus, for the single branch at line 9, we encountered it once and it was not taken → 'N'.
