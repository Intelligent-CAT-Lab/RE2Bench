[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution:

1. The method `__pow__` is called with:
   - `self`: a Permutation object with `_array_form = null` (likely None), `_size = 7`, `_cyclic_form = null`
   - `n = -2`

2. First line in `__pow__`: `if isinstance(n, Permutation):`
   - `n = -2`, which is an `int`, not a `Permutation` instance.
   - So this branch is NOT taken → `N`.

3. The `if` block is skipped, goes to `n = int(n)` (which is already an int) then `return self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`.

Since the branch is only encountered once, the list has one element: `['N']`.
