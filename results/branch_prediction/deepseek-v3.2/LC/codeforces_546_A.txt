[THOUGHT]
Given input "1 1 1", we have k=1, n=1, w=1.  
Initialize sum=0.  
Loop: i from 1 to 1 inclusive, sum += 1*1 => sum=1.  
Condition sum <= n: 1 <= 1 is True, so the branch is taken.  
The branch point at line 5 is encountered only once, so the outcome is ['Y'].

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
9 
10
