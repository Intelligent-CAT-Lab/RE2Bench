[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `level_up()` with the given input:
- `self.level` is 3.
- The condition `self.level < 100` is evaluated: 3 < 100 is True.
- Therefore, the branch is taken → append 'Y'.
- The code inside the if block executes: level increases by 1, exp becomes 0, hp increases by 20, attack_power by 5, defense by 5.
- Then the method returns the tuple.
- The branch is only encountered once during this method execution.

Thus, for the single branch marker, the taken list should be ['Y'].
