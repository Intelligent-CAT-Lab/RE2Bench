Let me trace through the code step by step.

1. The input shows that `self.args` = ["2", "A", "B"]. 
2. In `args_cnc` method, it first calls `self.as_coeff_matrices()`.
3. Looking at `as_coeff_matrices()`: it separates scalars from matrices.
   - Scalars: elements that are NOT matrices -> "2" (a number/symbol, not a matrix)
   - Matrices: elements that ARE matrices -> "A", "B"
4. `coeff = Mul(*scalars)` = `Mul("2")` = just the scalar "2"
5. So `coeff_c, coeff_nc = coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)` - since coeff is `Mul("2")`, which is a SymPy Mul object, it has an `args_cnc` method.
6. The first check: `if coeff_c == [1]:` - Let's see what `coeff_c` is:
   - For `Mul("2")`, the canonical and commutative part would typically be `[2]`, not `[1]`.
   - Since we have a single scalar "2", `coeff_c` should be `[2]`, not `[1]`.
   - So this branch should not be taken: ['N']
7. The second check: `elif coeff_c == set([1]):` - This checks if `coeff_c` equals `set([1])`.
   - First, `coeff_c` is a list `[2]`, not a set.
   - Second, even if it were a set, it would be `{2}`, not `{1}`.
   - So this branch should not be taken either: ['N']
8. Therefore, for both branches, we have ['N', 'N'].
