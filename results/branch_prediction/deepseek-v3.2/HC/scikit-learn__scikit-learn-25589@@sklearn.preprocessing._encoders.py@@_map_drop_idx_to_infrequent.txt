[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution of `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` with the given input.

The input shows:
- self._infrequent_enabled = false
- feature_idx = 2
- drop_idx = "1" (note: as a string in the JSON, but likely will be used as integer 1 in context)

The method is:

```python
def _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx):
    if not self._infrequent_enabled:  ## branch 1
        return drop_idx
    # ... rest of code
```

Since `self._infrequent_enabled` is false, the condition `if not self._infrequent_enabled:` evaluates to True. Therefore, the branch is taken once, and the method returns `drop_idx` immediately. The rest of the code is not executed.

So for this call, the branch is taken: 'Y'.

Only this one branch point is encountered during execution (the other branches in the code are not reached because we return early). Thus for the branch at line 71, we have a single 'Y'.

71         if not self._infrequent_enabled: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
