[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input.

The function `interval_contains` is called with:
- interval = array([-107.73502692, -7.73502692])
- val = -80.0

At line 2, we unpack the interval:
- a = -107.73502692
- b = -7.73502692

At line 3, we check `if a > b`:
- a = -107.73502692
- b = -7.73502692
- Is -107.73502692 > -7.73502692? No, -107.73502692 is less than -7.73502692
- So the condition is False, the branch is NOT taken

Therefore, the branch at line 3 should be marked as 'N'.

[ANSWER]
1 def interval_contains(interval, val):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     return a <= val <= b
