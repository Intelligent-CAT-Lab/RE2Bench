[THOUGHT]
The function `starts_one_ends` is called with argument `n = 5`.

At line 4, we check `if n == 1`:
- n = 5
- 5 == 1 is False
- The branch is not taken

So the function continues to line 5 and returns `18 * (10 ** (5 - 2))` = `18 * (10 ** 3)` = `18 * 1000` = `18000`.

The branch at line 4 is encountered once during execution, and it is not taken.
