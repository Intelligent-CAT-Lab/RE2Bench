[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `add_book` with the given input:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}`
   - `title = "book2"`
   - `quantity = 1` (default value)

2. Line 9: Check `if (title in self.inventory):`
   - We need to check if "book2" is in the inventory dictionary
   - The inventory has keys: "book1" and "book2"
   - "book2" IS in the inventory, so this condition is TRUE
   - This branch is TAKEN → append 'Y'

3. Line 10: `self.inventory[title] += quantity`
   - This line executes because the condition was true
   - `self.inventory["book2"] += 1` results in 1 + 1 = 2

4. Line 11: `else:` branch
   - Since the `if` condition was true, the `else` branch is NOT taken
   - append 'N'

So the branch at line 9 should be 'Y' and the branch at line 11 should be 'N'.
