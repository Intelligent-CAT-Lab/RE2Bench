[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution with x=2, y=1, z=1.

Line 5: Check if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)
- isinstance(2, int) is True
- isinstance(1, int) is True
- isinstance(1, int) is True
- All three are True, so the condition is True → branch taken

Line 6: Now inside the first if, check if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x)
- x+y == z: 2+1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
- x+z == y: 2+1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
- y+z == x: 1+1 == 2 → 2 == 2 → True
- Since the third condition is True, the overall or expression is True → branch taken

So line 7 executes and returns True.
