[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given input:

- `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]`
- `elem = 6`

At line 2, the condition is `if elem in array`:
- We check if `6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]`
- `6` is the first element of the array, so it is indeed in the array
- The condition evaluates to `True`
- Therefore, the branch is taken

Since the branch is taken, we execute line 3 which returns `array.index(6)` = `0`, and the function returns early without reaching line 4.

So the branch at line 2 is taken exactly once.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, elem):
2     if elem in array: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return array.index(elem)
4     return -1
[/ANSWER]
