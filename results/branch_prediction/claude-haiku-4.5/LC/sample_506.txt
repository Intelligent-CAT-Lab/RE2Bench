Let me trace through the code with n = 1.

Line 2: p = ''
Line 3: Check if n%2 == 1
  n = 1, so 1 % 2 = 1
  Is 1 == 1? Yes, this is True
  So the branch at line 3 is TAKEN (Y)

Line 4: p += 'sn', so p = 'sn'

Line 5: This is the else clause. Since the if at line 3 was taken, the else is NOT taken (N)

Line 6: This line is skipped since we didn't take the else branch

Line 7: for x in range(1, n+1):
  n = 1, so range(1, 2) gives us [1]
  So the loop will iterate once with x = 1

Line 8: Check if x%2 == 0
  x = 1, so 1 % 2 = 1
  Is 1 == 0? No, this is False
  So the branch at line 8 is NOT taken (N)

Line 9: p += 'to' - this is skipped because the if was not taken

Line 10: This is the else clause for the if at line 8. Since the if was not taken, the else IS taken (Y)

Line 11: p += 'ts', so p = 'sn' + 'ts' = 'snts'

Back to line 7: Loop ends since we've finished iterating through range(1, 2)

Line 12: return p (which is 'snts')

So the branch outcomes are:
- Line 3: Y (taken)
- Line 5: N (not taken)
- Line 8: N (not taken)
- Line 10: Y (taken)

1 def f(n):
2     p = ''
3     if n%2 == 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4         p+='sn'
5     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6         return n*n
7     for x in range(1, n+1):
8         if x%2 == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
9             p+='to'
10         else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
11             p+='ts'
12     return p
