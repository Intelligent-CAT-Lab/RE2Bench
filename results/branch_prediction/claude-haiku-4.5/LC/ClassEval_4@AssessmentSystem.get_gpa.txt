[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_gpa(name="Charlie")`:

1. The method is called with `name="Charlie"`
2. At line 9, we check the condition: `((name in self.students) and self.students[name]['courses'])`
   - First part: `name in self.students` → `"Charlie" in self.students` → Looking at the students dict, "Charlie" is indeed a key, so this is `True`
   - Second part: `self.students[name]['courses']` → `self.students["Charlie"]['courses']` → This is `{"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}`, which is a non-empty dictionary, so this is truthy (`True`)
   - Combined with `and`: `True and True` → `True`
3. Since the condition at line 9 is `True`, the if-branch is taken → append 'Y'
4. The code returns the calculated GPA and does not execute the else block
5. The else branch at line 11 is not taken → append 'N'
