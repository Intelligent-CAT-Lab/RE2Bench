[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `update_currency_rate` with the given input:

The method is called with:
- self.rates = {"USD": 1.0, "EUR": 0.85, "GBP": 0.72, "JPY": 110.15, "CAD": 1.23, "AUD": 1.34, "CNY": 7.18, "KRW": 1308.84}
- currency = "CNY"
- new_rate = 7.18

At line 9, we check: `if (currency not in self.rates):`
- currency = "CNY"
- self.rates contains "CNY" (it's in the dictionary)
- So "CNY" is in self.rates, which means (currency not in self.rates) is False
- The branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

After the condition, since the branch is not taken, we continue to line 11 where we update self.rates[currency] = new_rate.
