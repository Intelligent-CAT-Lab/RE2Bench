[THOUGHT]
The function f is called with:
- items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]
- target = "**"

At line 2, the condition checks: if target in items:
We need to determine if "**" is in the list ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"].

Looking through the list:
- "1" ≠ "**"
- "+" ≠ "**"
- "-" ≠ "**"
- "**" == "**" ✓ Found!

So "**" is in items, therefore the condition is True and the branch is taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(items, target):
2     if target in items:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return items.index(target)
4     return -1
