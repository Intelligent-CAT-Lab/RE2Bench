[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code with the given input:

The function `maximum(arr, k)` is called with:
- arr = [-4, 4]
- k = 2

At line 4, we check `if k == 0`:
- k = 2
- 2 == 0 is False
- So the branch is NOT taken

The execution continues to line 6 where arr is sorted, then line 7 gets the last k elements, and line 8 returns them.

So the branch at line 4 is taken only once during execution, and it is NOT taken.

[ANSWER]
1 
2 def maximum(arr, k):
3 
4     if k == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return []
6     arr.sort()
7     ans = arr[-k:]
8     return ans
9
