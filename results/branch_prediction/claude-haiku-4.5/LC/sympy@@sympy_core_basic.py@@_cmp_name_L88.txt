[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_cmp_name` with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- x = <class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>
- y = <class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>

Line 2: n1 = x.__name__ = "ImaginaryUnit"
Line 3: n2 = y.__name__ = "Pi"

Line 4: if n1 == n2:
- "ImaginaryUnit" == "Pi" → False
- Branch NOT taken → ['N']

Line 7: if not issubclass(y, Basic):
- y is <class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>, which is a sympy Basic subclass
- issubclass(y, Basic) → True
- not True → False
- Branch NOT taken → ['N']

Since line 7 is False, we continue to line 10.

Line 10: UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1

Lines 11-14: Try to find n1 in ordering_of_classes
- n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"
- This will either succeed and set i1 to the index, or fail with ValueError and set i1 = UNKNOWN
- From the context of sympy, "ImaginaryUnit" is likely in the ordering_of_classes, so i1 would be set to some index value (not UNKNOWN)

Lines 15-18: Try to find n2 in ordering_of_classes
- n2 = "Pi"
- This will either succeed and set i2 to the index, or fail with ValueError and set i2 = UNKNOWN
- From the context of sympy, "Pi" is likely in the ordering_of_classes, so i2 would be set to some index value (not UNKNOWN)

Line 19: if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN:
- If both i1 and i2 were successfully found in ordering_of_classes, then neither equals UNKNOWN
- i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN → False
- Branch NOT taken → ['N']

The function would then return (i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2) at line 21.
