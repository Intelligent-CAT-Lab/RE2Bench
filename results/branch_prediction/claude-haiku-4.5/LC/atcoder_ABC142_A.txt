Let me trace through this code with input 99.

Line 1: N = int(input())
- N = 99

Line 2: if N % 2 == 0:
- N % 2 = 99 % 2 = 1
- 1 == 0 is False
- Branch is NOT taken, so append 'N'

Line 4: else:
- Since the if condition was False, the else branch IS taken, so append 'Y'
- This executes: print((N + 1) / N / 2)
- (99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = (100/99)/2 ≈ 0.505...
- This prints the result

[ANSWER]
1 N = int ( input ( ) )
2 if N % 2 == 0 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3     print ( 0.5 )
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5     print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )
