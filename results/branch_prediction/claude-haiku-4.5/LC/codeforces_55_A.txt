[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code with input 9.

1. n = int(input()) → n = 9
2. while n % 2 == 0: This checks if n is even.
   - n = 9: 9 % 2 = 1, which is not 0, so the condition is False
   - The while loop does not execute, n remains 9
3. if n == 1: Check if n equals 1
   - n = 9, so 9 == 1 is False
   - This branch is NOT taken (N)
4. else: Since the if condition was False, we go to the else branch
   - This branch IS taken (Y)
5. print('NO')

So the branch at line 4 is not taken (N), and the branch at line 6 is taken (Y).

[ANSWER]
1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 while n % 2 == 0 :
3     n /= 2
4 if n == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print ( 'YES' )
6 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
7     print ( 'NO' )

9
