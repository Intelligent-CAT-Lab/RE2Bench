[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `update_product_quantity` with the given input:

1. The method is called with `product_id=1` and `quantity=-3`
2. The inventory contains: `{"1": {"name": "product 1", "quantity": 2}}`
3. At line 10, we check: `if (product_id in self.inventory)`
   - `product_id` is the integer `1`
   - `self.inventory` has the key `"1"` (a string)
   - We're checking if integer `1` is in the inventory dictionary
   - The dictionary has string keys `"1"`, not integer keys `1`
   - `1 in {"1": {...}}` will be `False` because `1 != "1"` (different types)
   - So this branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

The branch condition fails because of a type mismatch: the product_id is an integer (1) but the inventory keys are strings ("1").
