[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step with the given input:
- planet1 = "Earth"
- planet2 = "Earth"
- planet_names = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")

At line 5, the condition is: `if planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2:`

Let me evaluate each part:
1. `planet1 not in planet_names`: "Earth" is in planet_names, so this is False
2. `planet2 not in planet_names`: "Earth" is in planet_names, so this is False
3. `planet1 == planet2`: "Earth" == "Earth" is True

The overall condition uses `or`, so:
False or False or True = True

Since the condition evaluates to True, the branch is taken.
