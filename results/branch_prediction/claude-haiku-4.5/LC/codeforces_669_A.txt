[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with input n = 999999994.

1. n = int(input()) → n = 999999994
2. Line 9: Check if n % 3 == 0
   - 999999994 % 3 = ?
   - Let me calculate: 999999994 / 3 = 333333331.333...
   - 333333331 * 3 = 999999993
   - So 999999994 % 3 = 1
   - 1 == 0 is False → branch NOT taken

3. Line 11: Since the first condition was False, we check elif n < 3
   - n = 999999994
   - 999999994 < 3 is False → branch NOT taken

4. Since both conditions are False, we execute the else block at line 14

So the branch outcomes are:
- Line 9: N (not taken)
- Line 11: N (not taken)
