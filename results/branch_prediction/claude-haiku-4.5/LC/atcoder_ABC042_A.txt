[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code with the input "7 5 5".

Line 2: `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`
- input() returns "7 5 5"
- split() produces ["7", "5", "5"]
- map(int, ...) converts to integers
- tuple() creates (7, 5, 5)
- So ABC = (7, 5, 5)

Line 3: `if ABC.count(5) == 2:`
- ABC.count(5) counts how many times 5 appears in the tuple (7, 5, 5)
- The value 5 appears 2 times in the tuple
- So ABC.count(5) == 2 evaluates to True
- The branch is taken → 'Y'

Since the condition on line 3 is True, we enter the if block at line 4 and do NOT go to the else block at line 5.

Line 5: `else:` 
- This else corresponds to the if on line 3
- Since the if condition was True, the else branch is not taken → 'N'

The else block is not executed, so we skip line 6.

[ANSWER]
1 
2 ABC = tuple(map(int , input( ).split ( )))
3 if ABC.count(5) == 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
4     print ( 'YES' if sum ( ABC ) == 17 else 'NO' )
5 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 'NO' )
