[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with x=1 and n=1.

Line 4: `if (n == 1):`
- n = 1, so n == 1 is True
- The branch is taken, so this is 'Y'

Line 5: `return (x == 1)`
- x = 1, so x == 1 is True
- The function returns True and exits

Since the function returns at line 5, we never reach the while loop at line 7.

So there is only one branch point encountered:
- Line 4: taken=Y (because n == 1 is True)

4     if (n == 1): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
5         return (x == 1)
6     power = 1
7     while (power < x):
8         power = power * n
9     return (power == x)
