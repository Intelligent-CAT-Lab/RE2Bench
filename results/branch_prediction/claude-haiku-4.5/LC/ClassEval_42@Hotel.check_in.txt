<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution of check_in with the given inputs:

Initial state:
- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}
- room_type = "single"
- room_number = 2
- name = "guest 1"

Line 11: if (room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()):
- room_type = "single"
- self.booked_rooms.keys() = ["single"]
- "single" is IN self.booked_rooms.keys()
- So "single" not in keys() evaluates to False
- This branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

Line 13: if (name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]):
- name = "guest 1"
- room_type = "single"
- self.booked_rooms[room_type] = self.booked_rooms["single"] = {}
- "guest 1" is NOT in {} (empty dict)
- This condition is False
- This branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

Since line 13's condition is False, we skip the if block (lines 14-19) and the function continues past line 19. The function doesn't explicitly return anything in this path, so it implicitly returns None.

Wait, let me reconsider. The function has:
- Line 12: return False (if line 11 is true)
- Lines 14-19 (inside the if block from line 13)
- The function appears incomplete in what was shown

Looking at the code structure:
- Line 11: if condition that returns False
- Line 13: if condition with nested if/elif/else
- Since line 11's condition is false, we don't return
- Since line 13's condition is false, we skip the entire if block

So the execution path is:
1. Line 11 check: False (branch NOT taken) → 'N'
2. Line 13 check: False (branch NOT taken) → 'N'
3. Lines 14, 16, 18 are never reached because line 13 is False
