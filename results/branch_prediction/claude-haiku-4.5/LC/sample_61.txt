[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the input text = "".

1. Line 2: `texts = text.split()` 
   - Since text is an empty string "", calling split() on it returns an empty list []
   - So texts = []

2. Line 3: `if texts:`
   - We need to check if texts is truthy
   - texts = [] which is an empty list
   - An empty list is falsy in Python
   - So the condition `if texts:` evaluates to False
   - The branch is NOT taken

3. Since the branch at line 3 is not taken, we skip lines 4-5 and go directly to line 6
4. Line 6: `return 'nada'`

So the branch at line 3 is encountered once during execution and is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def f(text):
2     texts = text.split()
3     if texts:  ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4         xtexts = [t for t in texts if t.isascii() and t not in ('nada', '0')]
5         return max(xtexts, key=len) if xtexts else 'nada'
6     return 'nada'
