<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution of `add_item(item_name="Coke", price=1.25, quantity=10)`:

1. Line 10: `if (not self.restock_item(item_name, quantity)):`
   - This calls `restock_item("Coke", 10)`
   
2. In `restock_item("Coke", 10)`:
   - Line 14: `if (item_name in self.inventory):`
     - Check if "Coke" is in `self.inventory`
     - `self.inventory` is `{"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 20}}`
     - "Coke" IS in the inventory, so this branch is taken → append 'Y'
   - Line 15: `self.inventory[item_name]['quantity'] += quantity`
     - Updates Coke's quantity from 20 to 30
   - Line 16: `return True`
     - Returns True
   - The `else` at line 17 is not executed since the `if` was taken

3. Back to line 10 in `add_item`:
   - `restock_item` returned True
   - `not True` = False
   - The condition `if (not self.restock_item(...))` evaluates to False
   - So this branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

Summary of branch annotations:
- Line 10: taken=['N'] (the if condition is False, so the branch is not taken)
- Line 14: taken=['Y'] (the item is in inventory)
- Line 17: taken=['N'] (the if was taken, so else is not executed)
