[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `change_order_status` with the given input:

1. The method is called with `order_id=1` and `status="Delivered"`
2. The `self.orders` dictionary contains: `{"1": {"product_id": 1, "quantity": 5, "status": "Delivered"}}`
3. At line 10, we check `if (order_id in self.orders):`
   - `order_id` is `1` (an integer)
   - `self.orders` has keys: `"1"` (a string)
   - In Python, `1 in {"1": ...}` checks if the integer `1` is a key in the dictionary
   - The key in the dictionary is the string `"1"`, not the integer `1`
   - Therefore, `1 in self.orders` evaluates to `False`
   - So the first branch (line 10) is NOT taken → append 'N'
4. The else branch (line 12) is executed, which means it IS taken → append 'Y'
5. The method returns `False`

So the branch outcomes are: [N, Y]
