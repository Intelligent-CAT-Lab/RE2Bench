<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the code with var = " 99 777".

Line 2: if var.isdigit()
var = " 99 777"
" 99 777".isdigit() checks if all characters are digits. Since there are spaces, this returns False.
Branch NOT taken → 'N'

Line 4: elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit()
Since line 2 was False, we check this condition.
var.replace('.', '', 1) = " 99 777".replace('.', '', 1) = " 99 777" (no dots to replace)
" 99 777".isdigit() returns False (has spaces and is not all digits).
Branch NOT taken → 'N'

Line 6: elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1
Since line 4 was False, we check this condition.
var.count(' ') counts spaces in " 99 777"
There are 2 spaces in " 99 777" (one before 99, one between 99 and 777)
len(var) = len(" 99 777") = 7
len(var) - 1 = 6
2 == 6 is False
Branch NOT taken → 'N'

Line 8: elif len(var) == 1
Since line 6 was False, we check this condition.
len(" 99 777") = 7
7 == 1 is False
Branch NOT taken → 'N'

Line 10: else
Since all previous conditions were False, the else block is executed.
Branch taken → 'Y'

[ANSWER]
1 def f(var):
2     if var.isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
3         return "int"
4     elif var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit(): ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
5         return "float"
6     elif var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
7         return "str"
8     elif len(var) == 1:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
9         return "char"
10     else:  ## [BRANCH]taken=['Y'][/BRANCH]
11         return "tuple"
