Let me trace through the execution of the `level_up` method with the given input:

Initial state:
- self.level = 3
- self.hp = 140
- self.attack_power = 30
- self.defense = 20
- self.exp = 0

Execution:
1. Line 14: Check condition `if (self.level < 100):`
   - self.level = 3
   - Is 3 < 100? Yes, this is true
   - So the branch is taken → append 'Y'

2. Lines 15-19: Execute the body of the if statement
   - self.level += 1 → level becomes 4
   - self.exp = 0
   - self.hp += 20 → hp becomes 160
   - self.attack_power += 5 → attack_power becomes 35
   - self.defense += 5 → defense becomes 25

3. Line 20: Return (4, 160, 35, 25)

Since the condition on line 14 is true (3 < 100), the branch is taken.
