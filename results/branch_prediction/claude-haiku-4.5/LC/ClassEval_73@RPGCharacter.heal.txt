[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the heal method:

1. Initial state: self.hp = 100
2. Line 14: self.hp += 10 → self.hp becomes 100 + 10 = 110
3. Line 15: Check if (self.hp > 100) with self.hp = 110
   - Is 110 > 100? Yes, this is true, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'
4. Line 16: self.hp = 100 (executed because branch was taken)
5. Line 17: return self.hp (which is now 100)

16             self.hp = 100
17         return self.hp
