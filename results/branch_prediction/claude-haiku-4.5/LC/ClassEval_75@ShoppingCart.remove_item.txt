[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `remove_item` with the given input:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self.items = {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 4}}`
   - `item = "apple"`
   - `quantity = 1` (default value)

2. Line 9: Check if `(item in self.items)` where `item = "apple"` and `self.items = {"apple": {...}}`
   - "apple" is indeed a key in the dictionary `self.items`
   - This condition is True, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'

3. Line 10: Since the condition was True, this line executes and reduces the quantity
   - `self.items["apple"]["quantity"] -= 1` (4 becomes 3)

4. Line 11-12: The else block is not executed since the if condition was True
   - The else branch is not taken → append 'N'
