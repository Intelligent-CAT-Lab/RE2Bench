[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `select` method with the given input:

Input:
- `self.table_name = "table1"`
- `fields = None` (default value, not provided in kwargs)
- `condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"` (provided in kwargs)

Step-by-step execution:

1. Line 9: `if (fields is None):` 
   - `fields` is `None` by default (not passed in kwargs)
   - This condition is `True`, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'

2. Line 10: `fields = '*'` executes

3. Line 11: `else:` 
   - Since the `if` condition was taken, the `else` branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

4. Line 13: `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
   - `fields` is now `'*'`
   - `sql` becomes `'SELECT * FROM table1'`

5. Line 14: `if (condition is not None):`
   - `condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`, which is not `None`
   - This condition is `True`, so the branch is taken → append 'Y'

6. Line 15: `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'` executes
   - `sql` becomes `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`

7. Line 16: `return (sql + ';')`
   - Returns `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;'`

Branch outcomes: ['Y', 'N', 'Y']
