[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

First, the function creates a list `counts` of 301 zeros.

Then it loops through `ints = [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`:
- i=2: counts[2] becomes 1
- i=3: counts[3] becomes 1
- i=5: counts[5] becomes 1
- i=2: counts[2] becomes 2
- i=4: counts[4] becomes 1
- i=5: counts[5] becomes 2
- i=2: counts[2] becomes 3
- i=89: counts[89] becomes 1

So after this loop:
- counts[2] = 3
- counts[3] = 1
- counts[4] = 1
- counts[5] = 2
- counts[89] = 1
- All other indices have 0

Now the second loop iterates through `range(len(counts))` which is `range(301)`, so i goes from 0 to 300.

At line 9, the condition is `if counts[i] >= 3`:
- i=0: counts[0]=0, 0>=3? No → N
- i=1: counts[1]=0, 0>=3? No → N
- i=2: counts[2]=3, 3>=3? Yes → Y
- i=3: counts[3]=1, 1>=3? No → N
- i=4: counts[4]=1, 1>=3? No → N
- i=5: counts[5]=2, 2>=3? No → N
- i=6 through i=88: all have counts[i]=0, 0>=3? No → N (83 times)
- i=89: counts[89]=1, 1>=3? No → N
- i=90 through i=300: all have counts[i]=0, 0>=3? No → N (211 times)

So the branch is taken once (at i=2) and not taken 300 times.

The sequence should be: [N]*2 + [Y] + [N]*298
Which is: N, N, Y, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N

Actually, let me count more carefully. The range is 301 items (0 to 300 inclusive). So there are 301 branch evaluations total.
- Position 0: N
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: Y
- Positions 3-300: N (298 positions)

Total: 1 Y and 300 N

Let me represent this as a list with each position.
