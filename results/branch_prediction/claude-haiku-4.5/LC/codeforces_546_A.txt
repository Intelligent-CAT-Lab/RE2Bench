[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step with input "1 1 1".

Line 1: k, n, w = map(int, input().strip().split())
- input() returns "1 1 1"
- After strip() and split(): ["1", "1", "1"]
- After map(int, ...): k=1, n=1, w=1

Line 2: sum = 0
- sum is initialized to 0

Line 3-4: for i in range(1, w + 1):
- range(1, w + 1) = range(1, 2) = [1]
- So the loop runs once with i=1
- sum += k * i
- sum = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1

Line 5: if sum <= n:
- sum = 1, n = 1
- 1 <= 1 is True
- So the branch IS taken

Line 6: print(0)
- This executes

The else block (lines 7-8) is not executed.

[ANSWER]
1 k , n , w = map ( int , input ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
2 sum = 0
3 for i in range ( 1 , w + 1 ) :
4     sum += k * i
5 if sum <= n : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
6     print ( 0 )
7 else :
8     print ( sum - n )
