[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `deposit` method with the given input:

1. The method is called with `amount=300` and `self.balance=0`
2. At line 9, we check the condition `if (amount < 0):`
   - We need to evaluate: `300 < 0`
   - This is False, so the branch is NOT taken
   - Append 'N'
3. The code continues to line 11: `self.balance += amount` (balance becomes 300)
4. Line 12 returns the new balance (300)

The branch at line 9 is not taken because 300 is not less than 0.
