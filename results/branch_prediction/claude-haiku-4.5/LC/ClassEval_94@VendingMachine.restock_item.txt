[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of restock_item with the given input:

1. self.inventory = {"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 10}}
2. item_name = "Pizza"
3. quantity = 10

4. Line 10: Check if (item_name in self.inventory)
   - We're checking if "Pizza" is in self.inventory
   - self.inventory only contains "Coke"
   - "Pizza" is NOT in the inventory
   - So the condition is False, branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

5. Line 13: The else clause
   - Since the if condition was False, the else clause is executed
   - The branch is taken → append 'Y'
   - The function returns False
