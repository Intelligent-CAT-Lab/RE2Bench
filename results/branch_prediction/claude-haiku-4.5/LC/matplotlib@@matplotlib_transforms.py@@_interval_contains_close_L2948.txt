[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_interval_contains_close` with the given input.

Input:
- interval: array([0., 2.])
- val: array(0.)
- rtol: 1e-10

Execution:
1. Line 2: `a, b = interval` unpacks the array to a=0., b=2.
2. Line 3: Check `if a > b:` which is `if 0. > 2.:`
   - This condition is False, since 0. is not greater than 2.
   - So the branch is NOT taken → 'N'
3. The code continues to line 5 without executing line 4
4. Line 5: `rtol = (b - a) * rtol` = (2. - 0.) * 1e-10 = 2e-10
5. Line 6: `return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol` = 0. - 2e-10 <= 0. <= 2. + 2e-10
   - This evaluates to True and returns

The branch on line 3 is not taken.

[ANSWER]
1 def _interval_contains_close(interval, val, rtol=1e-10):
2     a, b = interval
3     if a > b: ## [BRANCH]taken=['N'][/BRANCH]
4         a, b = b, a
5     rtol = (b - a) * rtol
6     return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
