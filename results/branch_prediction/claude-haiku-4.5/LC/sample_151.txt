[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with text = "697 this is the ultimate 7 address to attack".

The function iterates through each character in text:
- '6': c.isdigit() is True → branch at line 3 taken (Y)
  - c == '0' is False → branch at line 4 not taken (N)
  - else branch at line 6 taken (Y)
  - c = '0' if c != '1' else '.' → '6' != '1' is True → c = '0'

- '9': c.isdigit() is True → branch at line 3 taken (Y)
  - c == '0' is False → branch at line 4 not taken (N)
  - else branch at line 6 taken (Y)
  - c = '0' if c != '1' else '.' → '9' != '1' is True → c = '0'

- '7': c.isdigit() is True → branch at line 3 taken (Y)
  - c == '0' is False → branch at line 4 not taken (N)
  - else branch at line 6 taken (Y)
  - c = '0' if c != '1' else '.' → '7' != '1' is True → c = '0'

- ' ': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 't': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'h': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'i': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 's': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- ' ': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'i': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 's': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- ' ': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 't': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'h': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'e': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- ' ': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'u': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'l': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 't': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'i': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'm': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- '7': c.isdigit() is True → branch at line 3 taken (Y)
  - c == '0' is False → branch at line 4 not taken (N)
  - else branch at line 6 taken (Y)
  - c = '0' if c != '1' else '.' → '7' != '1' is True → c = '0'

- ' ': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'a': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'd': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'd': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'r': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'e': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 's': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 's': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'c': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)

- 'k': c.isdigit() is False → branch at line 3 not taken (N)
