[THOUGHT]
The input is "a j c n x X k", so we iterate through each character in order: 'a', ' ', 'j', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'n', ' ', 'x', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'k'.

At line 3, the condition is if char.isupper():
- 'a': 'a'.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- ' ': ' '.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- 'j': 'j'.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- ' ': ' '.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- 'c': 'c'.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- ' ': ' '.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- 'n': 'n'.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- ' ': ' '.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- 'x': 'x'.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- ' ': ' '.isupper() is False → branch not taken
- 'X': 'X'.isupper() is True → branch taken, return False

So the branch is taken once at 'X'.

1 def f(input):
2     for char in input:
3         if char.isupper(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
