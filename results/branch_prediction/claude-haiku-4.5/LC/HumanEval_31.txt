Let me trace through the code with n = 13441.

Line 5: if n < 2
n = 13441, so 13441 < 2 is False. The branch is not taken.

Line 7: for k in range(2, n - 1)
This creates a range from 2 to n - 1 = 13440 (exclusive of 13440, so up to 13439).
The loop will iterate with k = 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439.

Line 8: if n % k == 0
We need to check if 13441 is divisible by any k in range(2, 13440).

Let me check if 13441 is prime. I need to find factors:
- 13441 % 2 = 1 (odd, not divisible by 2)
- Let me check if 13441 = 116² + something... Actually, let me try small primes:
- sqrt(13441) ≈ 116, so I only need to check up to around 116 if looking for factors

Actually, let me be more careful. 13441 = 116² = 13456? No, 116² = 13456.
Let me try: 115² = 13225, 116² = 13456. So sqrt(13441) is between 115 and 116, approximately 116.

Let me check divisibility:
- 13441 / 7 = 1920.14... (not divisible)
- 13441 / 11 = 1221.909... (not divisible)
- 13441 / 13 = 1033.923... (not divisible)

Actually, I should check: is 13441 a perfect square? 116² = 13456, so no.

Let me try a different approach. Is 13441 = 113 × 119? 113 × 119 = 13447, close but not exact.
Is 13441 = 116 × 115 + something? 116 × 115 = 13340, so 13441 - 13340 = 101.

Actually, let me try: 13441 / 7 = 1920.14..., 13441 / 11 = 1220.09..., 13441 / 13 = 1033.92..., 13441 / 17 = 790.647..., 13441 / 19 = 707.42..., 13441 / 23 = 584.39..., 13441 / 29 = 463.48..., 13441 / 31 = 433.58..., 13441 / 37 = 363.27..., 13441 / 41 = 327.82..., 13441 / 43 = 312.581..., 13441 / 47 = 286.0..., 13441 / 53 = 253.6..., 13441 / 59 = 227.8..., 13441 / 61 = 220.344..., 13441 / 67 = 200.61..., 13441 / 71 = 189.31..., 13441 / 73 = 184.12..., 13441 / 79 = 170.13..., 13441 / 83 = 161.93..., 13441 / 89 = 151.0..., 13441 / 97 = 138.56..., 13441 / 101 = 133.07..., 13441 / 103 = 130.49..., 13441 / 107 = 125.61..., 13441 / 109 = 123.31..., 13441 / 113 = 119.

Let me check 113 × 119 = 13447? No wait, let me compute: 113 × 119 = 113 × 100 + 113 × 19 = 11300 + 2147 = 13447. That's not 13441.

Hmm, 13441 / 113 might not be exact. Let me try: 13441 = 113 × k. k = 13441/113 ≈ 119.03...

Actually, wait. Let me check if 13441 is prime by checking if it has small factors more carefully.

13441 % 7: 13441 = 1920 × 7 + 1, so remainder is 1.
13441 % 11: Let me use alternating sum: 1 - 3 + 4 - 4 + 1 = -1, so 13441 % 11 = 10.
13441 % 13: 13441 = 1033 × 13 + 12, so remainder is 12.

Actually, I realize this might be a prime number. Let me assume it is for now and proceed with the logic.

If 13441 is prime, then for all k in range(2, 13440), n % k != 0, so the condition on line 8 is never true.

The branch at line 8 would be taken zero times (never executed, or rather, the condition is never true when checked).

Wait, I need to reconsider the logic. The loop does execute from k=2 to k=13439. At each iteration, line 8 checks if n % k == 0. If 13441 is prime, this condition is always False for all k in the range, so the branch is never taken.

So: Line 5: N (not taken), Line 8: [N, N, N, ...] (never taken in any iteration, but that's a lot of iterations).

Actually, looking at the format requested, I should list each time the branch is encountered. Since the loop iterates 13438 times (from 2 to 13439), the branch at line 8 is encountered 13438 times. If 13441 is prime, it would be [N, N, N, ..., N] with 13438 N's.

However, that seems impractical. Let me reconsider: maybe the expected answer is just to show whether the branch is taken or not overall. But the example shows multiple entries for a loop with 4 iterations.

So following the example format strictly, I should list N for each iteration of the loop. With 13438 iterations, that's a lot of N's.

But wait - maybe I should just verify if 13441 is actually prime or has factors. Let me check 13441 more carefully.

13441 = 116^2 + 25 = 13456 - 15? Let me try: is it a perfect square minus something?
Actually, 115.9^2 ≈ 13432, 116^2 = 13456.

Let me try some factors around sqrt(13441) ≈ 116:
113 × 119 = 13447
115 × 117 = 13455
116 × 116 = 13456

Hmm, none of these equal 13441.

Actually, I wonder if 13441 itself equals something like 119 × 113. Let me check: 119 × 113 = (120-1) × 113 = 13560 - 113 = 13447. Nope.

Let me try: is 13441 = 7 × 1920 + 1? Yes. So not divisible by 7.

Given the complexity and the pattern, I'll assume 13441 is prime. In that case:
- Line 5: N (13441 is not < 2)
- Line 8: N repeated for each of the 13438 iterations (since 13441 is prime, no divisor exists in range(2, 13440))

However, representing this as [N, N, ..., N] with 13438 entries is unwieldy. Let me reconsider the format...

Actually, checking online or by calculation: 13441 = 119 × 113? Let me verify: 119 × 113 = 119 × (100 + 13) = 11900 + 1547 = 13447. That's 13447, not 13441.

What about 13441 = 121 × 111? 121 × 111 = 121 × 100 + 121 × 11 = 12100 + 1331 = 13431. Still not 13441.

What about 13441 = 117 × something? 13441 / 117 ≈ 114.9, so 13441 ≈ 117 × 114.9...

Actually, you know what, let me just assume 13441 is prime or at least that it doesn't have small factors that would be found early in the range. For practical purposes with the loop running from 2 to 13439:

If 13441 is prime, the branch at line 8 is never taken, so it would be represented as [N, N, N, ...] but with potentially thousands of entries.

Given the format constraints and typical testing, I suspect the code is testing a small prime like 13441. Let me verify one more time if there's an obvious factor:

13441 / 109 = 123.31...
13441 / 107 = 125.61...

Actually, I should just compute: is 13441 = 116^2 + something? 116^2 = 13456, so 13441 = 13456 - 15. Not helpful.

Let me try backward from sqrt: sqrt(13441) ≈ 116. Factors would be at most 116.

After all this, I'll go with the assumption that 13441 is prime. The branch at line 8 is encountered many times but never taken. However, representing this with thousands of N's is impractical.

Let me check: could 13441 = 116^2 - 15 help? Or maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Actually, I just realized: the loop goes from 2 to n-1 = 13440 (exclusive), so to 13439. That's range(2, 13440), which is 13439 - 2 = 13437 iterations.

Regardless, if 13441 is prime, line 8 condition is never true. So the answer would be:
Line 5: N
Line 8: [N × 13437] (a very long list of N's)

But this seems odd for a test case. Let me reconsider if 13441 might have a factor...

Actually, I'll just go with what seems most reasonable: if no small factors are found quickly and 13441 is indeed prime, then the branch is never taken throughout the loop.

For practical annotation purposes, I'll represent this as simply indicating the first few and suggesting it continues, or I'll compute the exact number.

The range is range(2, 13440), which yields 13438 values (from 2 to 13439 inclusive).

So Line 8 branch is encountered 13438 times, and if 13441 is prime, it's never taken: [N, N, N, ..., N] (13438 times).

This is impractical to write out fully. Let me check if there's a mistake in my understanding or if the number is actually composite...

Actually, let me try: 13441 = 7 × 1920 + 1 (already checked, not divisible)

You know what, I'm going to compute one more systematically:
13441 = 11 × 1221 + 10 (checked, remainder 10)
13441 = 13 × 1033 + 12 (checked, remainder 12)

Given the time spent, I'll provide my best answer: 13441 appears to be prime, so the branch at line 8 is never taken. For the annotation:

Line 5: N
Line 8: Since the loop runs 13438 times with the condition never being true, this would be [N, N, ..., N] (13438 times).

However, given practical constraints, I might represent this more concisely or check if there's a pattern I'm missing. But following the format strictly from the example, I should list each branch encounter.

Given the volume, I'll represent the most reasonable answer that captures the pattern.

[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with n = 13441.

Line 5: if n < 2
n = 13441, so 13441 < 2 is False. This branch is NOT taken.

Line 7: for k in range(2, n - 1)
This loop iterates from k = 2 to k = 13439 (since range(2, 13440) excludes 13440).
That's 13438 iterations.

Line 8: if n % k == 0
For each iteration, we check if 13441 is divisible by k.

Let me check if 13441 has any factors. Testing divisibility:
- 13441 is odd, so not divisible by 2
- Sum of digits: 1+3+4+4+1 = 13, not divisible by 3
- Doesn't end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5
- 13441 / 7 ≈ 1920.14 (not divisible)
- 13441 / 11: using alternating digit sum: 1-4+4-3+1 = -1, so remainder ≠ 0
- 13441 / 13 ≈ 1033.92 (not divisible)

Checking more systematically up to sqrt(13441) ≈ 116, I need to verify if 13441 is prime or composite. After checking common factors, 13441 appears to be prime.

If 13441 is prime, then for every iteration of the loop (k = 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439), the condition n % k == 0 evaluates to False, so the branch is never taken.

Since the loop executes 13438 times and the branch is never taken in any iteration, the answer is:
- Line 5: N (not taken)
- Line 8: [N repeated 13438 times] (branch never taken in any iteration)
