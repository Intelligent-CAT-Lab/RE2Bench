[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step with input " 1 1".

Line 1: x = list(input().split())
- input() returns " 1 1"
- .split() splits on whitespace: [" 1", "1"] → actually split() with no args splits on any whitespace and removes empty strings, so it returns ["1", "1"]
- list() converts it to ["1", "1"]
- So x = ["1", "1"]

Lines 2-3: for loop converts strings to integers
- i = 0: x[0] = int("1") = 1
- i = 1: x[1] = int("1") = 1
- x = [1, 1]

Line 4: a = x[0] = 1
Line 5: b = x[1] = 1

Line 6: print(min(x), end=" ")
- min([1, 1]) = 1
- prints "1 " (with space, no newline)

Line 7: if abs(a - b) >= 2:
- abs(1 - 1) = abs(0) = 0
- 0 >= 2 is False
- branch NOT taken

Line 9: else:
- This else corresponds to the if at line 7
- Since the if was not taken, the else IS taken
- branch IS taken

Line 10: print(0)
- prints "0"
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 x = list ( input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
3     x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
4 a = x [ 0 ]
5 b = x [ 1 ]
6 print ( min ( x ) , end = " " )
7 if abs ( a - b ) >= 2 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
8     print ( abs ( a - b ) // 2 )
9 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
10     print ( 0 )
