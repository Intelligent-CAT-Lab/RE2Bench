[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution:

1. The function f is called with:
   - string = "UppEr"
   - encryption = 0

2. At line 2, we check the condition: if encryption == 0:
   - encryption is 0
   - 0 == 0 is True
   - So the branch IS taken, we return "UppEr" at line 3

3. Since the if branch at line 2 is taken and we return at line 3, the else block at line 4 is never executed.
   - The else branch is NOT taken

So:
- Line 2 branch: taken = Y (encryption == 0 is True)
- Line 4 branch: taken = N (else is not executed because if was taken)
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 def f(string, encryption):
2     if encryption == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3         return string
4     else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5         return string.upper().encode('rot13')
[/ANSWER]
