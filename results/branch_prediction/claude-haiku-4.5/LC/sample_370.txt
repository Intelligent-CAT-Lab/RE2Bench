[THOUGHT]
The function f iterates through the characters in text = "     i".

The loop processes characters in order: ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'i'

At line 3, the condition is if not char.isspace():
- char = ' ': ' '.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
- char = ' ': ' '.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
- char = ' ': ' '.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
- char = ' ': ' '.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
- char = ' ': ' '.isspace() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
- char = 'i': 'i'.isspace() is False → not False is True → branch taken, return False is executed

So the branch outcomes are: N, N, N, N, N, Y

1 def f(text):
2     for char in text:
3         if not char.isspace(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[N,N,N,N,N,Y][/BRANCH]
4             return False
5     return True
