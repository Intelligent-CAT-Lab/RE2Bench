[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given inputs:
- array = [1]
- index = 0

Line 2: Check if index < 0
- index = 0
- 0 < 0 is False
- Therefore, the branch is NOT taken

Line 3: This line is skipped since the condition was false

Line 4: return array[index]
- return array[0]
- return 1

So the branch at line 2 is encountered once and is not taken.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def f(array, index):
2     if index < 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
3         index = len(array) + index
4     return array[index]
[/ANSWER]
