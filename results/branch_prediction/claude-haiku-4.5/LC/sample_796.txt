[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of function `f` with the given inputs:
- str = "fnuiyh"
- toget = "ni"

At line 2, the condition is `if str.startswith(toget):`
- str.startswith("ni") checks if "fnuiyh" starts with "ni"
- "fnuiyh" starts with "fn", not "ni"
- So str.startswith("ni") returns False
- The if branch at line 2 is NOT taken

Since the if condition is False, the else branch at line 3 is taken.

So:
- Line 2 branch (if): Not taken → 'N'
- Line 3 branch (else): Taken → 'Y'
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 def f(str,toget):
2     if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):] ## [BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
3     else: return str ## [BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
