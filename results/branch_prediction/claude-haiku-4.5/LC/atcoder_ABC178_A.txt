[THOUGHT]
The input is 1, so x = int(input()) sets x = 1.

At line 2, we check if x == 1:
- x = 1, so the condition x == 1 is True
- The branch is taken, so we append 'Y'
- We execute line 3: print(0)
- We skip the else block

At line 4, the else clause corresponds to the if at line 2. Since the if condition was True and we executed the if block, we do not enter the else block. So we append 'N' for the else branch.

[ANSWER]
1 x = int ( input ( ) )
2 if x == 1 : ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
3     print (0)
4 else : ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
5     print (1)
