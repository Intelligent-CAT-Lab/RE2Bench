[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given inputs:
- nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]
- p = 6

Line 2: prev_p = p - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

Line 3: Check if prev_p < 0
- prev_p = 5
- Is 5 < 0? No, this is False
- So the branch is NOT taken

Line 4: return nums[prev_p] = nums[5] = 1

The condition at line 3 is only evaluated once, and it evaluates to False, so the branch is not taken.
</THOUGHT>

[ANSWER]
1 def f(nums, p):
2     prev_p = p - 1
3     if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1 ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
4     return nums[prev_p]
[/ANSWER]
