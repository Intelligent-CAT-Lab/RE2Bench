[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `add_argument` method with the given input:

Method call: `add_argument(arg="age", required=False, arg_type=<class 'int'>)`

1. Line 11: Check the condition `if required:` where `required=False`
   - Since `required` is `False`, the condition evaluates to `False`
   - This branch is NOT taken → append 'N'

2. Line 12: This line is skipped because the condition on line 11 was False

3. Line 13: `self.types[arg] = arg_type` is executed (this is outside the if block)

So the branch at line 11 is not taken.

13         self.types[arg] = arg_type
