[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `multinomial_coefficients(4, 2)` step by step.

1. `m = as_int(4)` → m = 4
2. `n = as_int(2)` → n = 2
3. Line 6: `if not m:` → `if not 4:` → False, so taken=N
4. Line 10: `if m == 2:` → `if 4 == 2:` → False, so taken=N
5. Line 12: `if m >= 2*n and n > 1:` → `if 4 >= 2*2 and 2 > 1:` → `if 4 >= 4 and True:` → True, so taken=Y

At this point, the function returns `dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(m, n))` and exits. We don't reach lines 14-42.

So the branch sequence is:
- Line 6: N (not m is False)
- Line 10: N (m == 2 is False)
- Line 12: Y (m >= 2*n and n > 1 is True)

We never reach line 18 or the while loop body, so branches at lines 18, 22, and 25 are not encountered.

Wait, let me re-read the instructions. It says "For each time that branch point is encountered during execution". So I only need to record branches that are actually encountered.

The branches encountered are:
- Line 6: N
- Line 10: N
- Line 12: Y

The branches at lines 18, 22, and 25 are not encountered because the function returns at line 13.
