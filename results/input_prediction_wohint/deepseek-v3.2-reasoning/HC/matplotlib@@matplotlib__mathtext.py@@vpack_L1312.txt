[THOUGHT]
1. The function `vpack` always returns `None`, so the output `{"output": null}` is valid for any input that doesn't raise an exception.
2. To avoid exceptions, `self.children` must not contain any `Char` nodes. The simplest case is an empty list of children.
3. With empty children, the loop in `vpack` does nothing, leaving `x=0`, `d=0`, `w=0`. Then `self.width=0`, `self.depth=0` (since `l=np.inf` and `d <= l`). With `m='additional'`, `self.height = h + x = h`. If `h=0`, then `x = h - x = 0`, so glue parameters are set to 0. If `h != 0`, `_set_glue` is called but `totals` are all zero, resulting in `glue_sign=0` and no warning because `len(self.children)=0`.
4. Choose default values for simplicity: `h=0.0`, `m='additional'`, and omit `l` (defaults to `np.inf`).
5. Represent `self` as a `Vlist` instance with `children` empty list, as other attributes are set by `vpack` and not needed for input.
