We are given the output of `_get_bracket`: vertices and codes. The vertices form a rectangle (actually a "⊓" shape) with coordinates:
- v0: (363.0020718742162, 304.4117647058823)
- v1: (358.0020718742162, 304.4117647058823)
- v2: (358.0020718742162, 354.4117647058823)
- v3: (363.0020718742162, 354.4117647058823)

The codes correspond to [Path.MOVETO, Path.LINETO, Path.LINETO, Path.LINETO].

From the function logic:
- The shape is constructed from parameters `(x0, y0, x1, y1, width, length, angle)`.
- The pre-rotation vertices are computed using:
  - `cos_t, sin_t = get_cos_sin(x1, y1, x0, y0)` (unit vector from `(x1, y1)` to `(x0, y0)`)
  - Two perpendicular points at distance `width` from `(x0, y0)` along the perpendicular direction.
  - A shift vector `(dx, dy) = length * (cos_t, sin_t)`.
- The vertices are then rotated around `(x0, y0)` by `angle` degrees.

From the output, we deduce:
- The rotation center `(x0, y0)` is the midpoint of `v1` and `v2` because they are images of symmetric points. Thus:
  - `x0 = (358.0020718742162 + 358.0020718742162) / 2 = 358.0020718742162`
  - `y0 = (304.4117647058823 + 354.4117647058823) / 2 = 329.4117647058823`
- The distance from `(x0, y0)` to `v1` (or `v2`) is `width = 25`.
- The vector from `v1` to `v0` is `(5, 0)`, which equals `(dx, dy)`. Since `dx, dy = length * (cos_t, sin_t)` and the magnitude is `length = 5` (as computed from `sqrt(|v0 - x0|^2 - width^2) = 5`), we have `length = 5`.
- The rotation angle `angle` and direction `(cos_t, sin_t)` are related: after rotation, `R(length * (cos_t, sin_t)) = (5, 0)`, so `R(cos_t, sin_t) = (1, 0)`. Thus `(cos_t, sin_t)` rotated by `angle` becomes `(1, 0)`, implying `angle = -atan2(sin_t, cos_t)`. However, `(cos_t, sin_t)` is the unit vector from `(x1, y1)` to `(x0, y0)`. Any choice of `(x1, y1)` such that this unit vector is consistent with `angle` will work. For simplicity, we can set `angle = 0` and choose `(x1, y1)` accordingly. With `angle = 0`, then `R` is identity, so `(cos_t, sin_t) = (1, 0)`. Then `dx, dy = (5, 0)` matches. Also, `v1 - (x0, y0) = (0, -25) = width * (sin_t, -cos_t) = 25 * (0, -1)`, so `sin_t = 0, -cos_t = -1` ⇒ `cos_t = 1`. Consistent.
- Thus we set `angle = 0`.
- To satisfy `cos_t = 1, sin_t = 0`, we need `get_cos_sin(x1, y1, x0, y0) = (1, 0)`. This means the vector from `(x1, y1)` to `(x0, y0)` is horizontal and positive in the x-direction. So we can choose `(x1, y1)` such that `x1 < x0` and `y1 = y0`. For simplicity, set `x1 = x0 - 1 = 357.0020718742162` and `y1 = y0 = 329.4117647058823`.

Therefore, the input parameters are:
- `x0 = 358.0020718742162`
- `y0 = 329.4117647058823`
- `x1 = 357.0020718742162`
- `y1 = 329.4117647058823`
- `width = 25`
- `length = 5`
- `angle = 0`

These produce the given output after the function's steps.
