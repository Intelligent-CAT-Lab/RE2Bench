The output is a 3x2 array: [[0,2], [1,4], [2,6]]. This could be the result of a ColumnTransformer that simply passes through the input columns unchanged. Therefore, the input X likely matches the output, i.e., X = [[0,2], [1,4], [2,6]]. The ColumnTransformer can be configured with a single transformer that uses 'passthrough' for both columns (indices 0 and 1). Since all columns are used, the remainder is 'drop'. Other parameters can be set to defaults. The y argument is not used and can be None. This setup ensures that fit_transform returns the input X without modification, matching the given output.
