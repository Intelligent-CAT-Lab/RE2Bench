[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_compute_n_features_outs` computes the number of output features for each input column after accounting for dropped categories and infrequent category grouping.
2. The output is `[2]`, meaning a single column results in 2 output features.
3. The calculation starts with `output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]`. To have a single element list, `self.categories_` must be a list with one array/list of categories. For the output to be 2, the initial length must be 2 (if no further adjustments) or larger if adjustments subtract appropriately.
4. Adjustments occur if `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is not None (subtract 1 per column where drop index is not None) and if `self._infrequent_enabled` is True (subtract `infreq_idx.size - 1` per column where infrequent indices exist).
5. To achieve a final output of 2 with minimal complexity, assume no drop and no infrequent category handling. This means:
   - `self.categories_` contains one category list with exactly 2 categories.
   - `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is `None` (so no subtraction).
   - `self._infrequent_enabled` is `False` (so infrequent adjustments are skipped).
   - `self._infrequent_indices` can be set to `[None]` for consistency.
6. This configuration yields: initial output = `[2]`, no subtractions, final output = `[2]`.
