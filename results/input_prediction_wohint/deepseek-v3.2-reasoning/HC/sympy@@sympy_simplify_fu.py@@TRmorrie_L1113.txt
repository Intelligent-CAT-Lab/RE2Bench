[THOUGHT]
The function TRmorrie(rv) applies a transformation to products of cosines using Morrie's law. Given the output is "cos(phi)", the simplest input that yields this output is cos(phi) itself. Simulating step by step: if rv = cos(phi), then bottom_up calls f on cos(phi). Since cos(phi) is not a Mul, f returns it unchanged. Thus TRmorrie returns cos(phi). Other inputs like cos(phi)*1 also yield cos(phi), but cos(phi) is the most straightforward.
