1. The output indicates that `__eq__` returned `True`, meaning the two kernel instances are considered equal.
2. For two instances to be equal, they must be of the same type and have the same parameters (as returned by `get_params`).
3. The simplest case is to use the base `Kernel` class itself, which has no parameters (its `__init__` has no arguments besides `self`).
4. Two instances of `Kernel` will have the same type and empty parameter dictionaries, so they are equal.
5. Therefore, the input can be: `self` as an empty object (no attributes) and `b` as an empty object.
6. Representing in JSON as per the example: `self` as an empty dictionary, `b` as an empty dictionary in `args`.
