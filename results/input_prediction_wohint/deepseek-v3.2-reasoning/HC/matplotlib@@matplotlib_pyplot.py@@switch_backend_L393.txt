1. The function `switch_backend` takes one argument `newbackend` (a string) and returns `None` when successful.
2. The output is `{"output": null}`, indicating the function returned `None` without raising an exception.
3. To achieve this, `newbackend` must be a valid backend name that can be loaded without errors, and the environment must allow the backend switch without framework conflicts or import issues.
4. The 'agg' backend is a non-interactive backend that is always available in matplotlib, making it a safe choice.
5. Simulating with `newbackend = "agg"`:
   - It is not the auto-backend sentinel (since that is a special object, not a string), so the function proceeds to load the backend module.
   - The module loads successfully, and the required interactive framework is `None`, so no framework conflict.
   - The function sets global parameters and calls `install_repl_displayhook()`, which should succeed for 'agg'.
   - No exceptions are raised, and the function returns `None`.
6. The input should be provided in JSON format. Following the example, since `switch_backend` is a function (not a method), we use `args` and `kwargs` without `self`.
7. Thus, the input is `{"args": ["agg"], "kwargs": {}}`.
