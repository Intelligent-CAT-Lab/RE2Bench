[THOUGHT]
The output consists of two 2×2 arrays of float ones, representing the initial W and H matrices. To produce this output, we consider the possible branches in `_check_w_h`:

1. **Branch A**: `init='custom'` and `update_H=True` returns the input W and H unchanged after validation. This is the simplest way to get the output: provide W and H as arrays of ones, with matching dtypes and shapes.
2. **Branch B**: `update_H=False` and `solver='mu'` could also produce W as a matrix of ones if `X.mean() / n_components = 1`, but this requires additional constraints (X mean of 2, solver='mu'). While possible, Branch A is more straightforward and requires fewer conditions.

Given the output is exactly ones, we choose Branch A. We set:
- `self.init = 'custom'`
- `self._n_components = 'auto'` (it will become 2 from H.shape)
- `X` as a 2×2 float array (any values, but dtype must match W and H)
- `W` and `H` as 2×2 float arrays of ones
- `update_H = True`

This satisfies the validation checks and returns the provided W and H unchanged.
