1. The output shows X with 50 samples and 2 features, so n_samples=50 and n_features=2 (default).
2. The labels y have three classes (0,1,2) with counts 17, 17, 16. This distribution matches when n_samples=50 and centers=3 (integer), because the function splits samples nearly equally among centers.
3. The data is shuffled (as seen from interleaved labels), so shuffle=True (default).
4. The values in X are concentrated in a small range (roughly -0.5 to 1.8), suggesting that the centers are not from the default center_box (-10,10). Either center_box was changed, or centers were provided explicitly.
5. The sample means per cluster are approximately (0.03, 0.00), (0.88, 0.99), and (0.03, 1.12). These are close to the points (0,0), (1,1), and (0,1), which could have been explicitly provided as centers.
6. The sample standard deviations per cluster are small (around 0.05, 0.15, 0.3), indicating cluster_std is likely less than 1 and possibly an array.
7. To reproduce the exact output, the exact centers, cluster_std, and random_state are needed. However, without the ability to compute the exact random seed, the most plausible input based on common test parameters in scikit-learn is chosen: centers=[[0,0], [1,1], [0,1]], cluster_std=0.2, and random_state=42. This aligns with the observed means and spreads.
