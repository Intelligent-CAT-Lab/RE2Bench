[THOUGHT]
1. The output JSON with `_rows: 2, _cols: 2, _mat: null` suggests a 2x2 matrix with no explicit entries, which matches a `ZeroMatrix` of shape (2,2).
2. `ZeroMatrix` can be the result of differentiating a matrix expression that does not depend on the variable of differentiation.
3. Therefore, the input to `_matrix_derivative` should consist of a 2x2 matrix (constant or independent of the variable) and a symbol for the variable.
4. For instance, let `expr` be a 2x2 constant matrix (e.g., `ImmutableDenseMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`) and `x` be a Symbol('x').
5. Then `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` will compute the derivative as a zero matrix of shape (2,2), represented internally with `_rows=2`, `_cols=2`, and `_mat=None` (null in JSON).
