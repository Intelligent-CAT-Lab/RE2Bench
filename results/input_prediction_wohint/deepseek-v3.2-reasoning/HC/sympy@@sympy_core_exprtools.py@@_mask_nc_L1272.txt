[THOUGHT]
1. The output from `_mask_nc` is a tuple: ("2 - 2*cos(phi)", {}, []). This indicates that the input expression `eq` is commutative, as the function returns `(eq, {}, [])` immediately when `expr.is_commutative` is True.
2. The first element of the tuple is exactly "2 - 2*cos(phi)", meaning `eq` equals this expression. Since the function returns `eq` unchanged, `eq` must be a commutative SymPy expression equivalent to 2 - 2*cos(phi).
3. The second and third elements are empty because no non-commutative parts were found or masked, so no dummy symbols were created. The optional `name` parameter (default 'mask') is irrelevant here but can be included.
4. To represent the input in JSON, `eq` is given as a string that SymPy can parse, and `name` is set to its default value 'mask' (or omitted, but included for completeness).
