[THOUGHT]
We need to provide an input to `_eval_is_extended_real` that yields output `true`. The method returns True in several branches. One simple branch is when `real_b` and `real_e` are both True and `self.base.is_extended_positive` is True. We can choose base = 2 and exp = 3, both integers. Then `2.is_extended_real` is True, `3.is_extended_real` is True, and `2.is_extended_positive` is True. So the method will return True. Therefore, the input is a Pow instance with base=2 and exp=3.
