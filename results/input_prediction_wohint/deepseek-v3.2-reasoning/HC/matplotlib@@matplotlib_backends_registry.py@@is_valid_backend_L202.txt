[THOUGHT]
The output is true, indicating that `is_valid_backend` returned True. The function returns True if the backend is in the built-in dictionary, in the instance's `_backend_to_gui_framework`, starts with 'module://', or after loading entry points is found in `_backend_to_gui_framework`. The simplest way to guarantee True without relying on the environment (installed packages) or modifying the instance state is to use a built-in backend. The built-in backends are listed in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`. One such backend is 'agg'. We assume the instance is in its initial state (just created) because the output does not require any prior state changes. Therefore, the input is an instance of BackendRegistry with default attributes and the backend argument set to 'agg'.
