1. The output of `extract` is an SDM represented as a dict-of-dicts with three rows (0,1,2) and one column (0), all values 1.
2. The `extract` method returns a submatrix consisting of selected rows and columns from the original SDM.
3. For the output to have three rows, the `rows` argument must be a list of three indices. Similarly, `cols` must be a list of one index.
4. Each nonzero in the output corresponds to a nonzero in the original matrix at (rows[i2], cols[j2]). Since all output values are 1, we need self[rows[i2]][cols[0]] = 1 for i2=0,1,2.
5. The simplest case is that `rows = [0, 1, 2]` and `cols = [0]`, and the original matrix `self` has exactly these three nonzeros: at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0). This implies shape at least (3,1). We can take shape=(3,1).
6. The domain can be any domain containing 1, such as ZZ (integers).
7. Thus the input to `extract` is: self = SDM(elemsdict={0:{0:1}, 1:{0:1}, 2:{0:1}}, shape=(3,1), domain=ZZ), rows=[0,1,2], cols=[0].
