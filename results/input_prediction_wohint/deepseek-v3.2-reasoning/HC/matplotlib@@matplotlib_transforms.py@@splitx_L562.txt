1. The output consists of three Bbox objects, indicating that `splitx` was called with two split points (since the method adds 0 and 1, creating four points and three intervals).
2. The coordinates of the output Bboxes are:
   - Bbox1: [[0.125, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]]
   - Bbox2: [[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]]
   - Bbox3: [[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.9, 0.9]]
3. From Bbox1, the left edge (x0) of the original bbox is 0.125, and the y-extents are y0 ≈ 0.1 and y1 = 0.9.
4. From Bbox3, the right edge (x1) of the original bbox is 0.9, so the width w = 0.9 - 0.125 = 0.775.
5. The right edge of Bbox1 is 0.78375, which corresponds to a fraction a such that 0.125 + a * 0.775 = 0.78375 → a = (0.78375 - 0.125)/0.775 = 0.65875/0.775 = 0.85.
6. Bbox2 has zero width, meaning the second split point b is equal to a, so b = 0.85 as well.
7. Thus, the original bbox has points [[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]], and `splitx` was called with two arguments: 0.85 and 0.85.
8. For the JSON input format, following the example structure, we represent "self" with an attribute `_points` (the internal storage for the bbox coordinates), "args" as a list of the split fractions, and "kwargs" as empty.
