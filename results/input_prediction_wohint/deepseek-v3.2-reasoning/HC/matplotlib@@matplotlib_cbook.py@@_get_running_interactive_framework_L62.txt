[THOUGHT]
The function `_get_running_interactive_framework` has no parameters, so its input is simply an empty call. The output "headless" indicates that the function determined no interactive framework is running and the display is not valid. However, the input to the function itself is just the absence of arguments; the environment (e.g., loaded modules, display state) is external and not part of the function's parameters. Therefore, the input JSON should reflect an empty argument list.
