1. The output is `y*tanh(1 + I)`, which is a product of `y` and the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number. The function `exptrigsimp` simplifies expressions involving exponentials and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions.

2. The identity `tanh(z) = (exp(2z) - 1)/(exp(2z) + 1)` suggests that `tanh(1+I)` equals `(exp(2+2*I) - 1)/(exp(2+2*I) + 1)`. Therefore, an input of the form `y*(exp(2+2*I) - 1)/(exp(2+2*I) + 1)` should simplify to `y*tanh(1+I)`.

3. The function `exptrigsimp` includes a transformation `f` that pattern-matches products containing factors like `(1 - exp(x))` and `(1 + exp(x))^-1` and converts them to `tanh(x/2)`. For `x = 2+2*I`, this yields `tanh(1+I)`.

4. The pattern requires the exponential terms to be recognized by `signlog`, which checks for `exp(x)` (the function) or `S.Exp1` (the constant `E`). Using `exp(2+2*I)` ensures `signlog` returns a valid `x`.

5. The expression `y*(exp(2+2*I) - 1)/(exp(2+2*I) + 1)` fits the pattern: numerator is `exp(2+2*I) - 1 = -(1 - exp(2+2*I))` (with `c = -1`, `sign = -1`), denominator is `exp(2+2*I) + 1 = 1 + exp(2+2*I)` (with `sign = 1`). The condition `newd[1 - sign * S.Exp1 ** x] == -m` holds for `m = 1` and `x = 2+2*I`, triggering the replacement with `tanh(x/2) = tanh(1+I)`.

6. Other forms (like using `E**(2+2*I)` or `sinh/cosh`) might not simplify directly due to representation mismatches or extra steps, but the chosen input reliably produces the output through the function's transformations.

7. Thus, the input expression is `y*(exp(2+2*I) - 1)/(exp(2+2*I) + 1)`.
