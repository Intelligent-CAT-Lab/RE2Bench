[THOUGHT]
We need to predict the input to the `__eq__` method that would produce the output `{"output": true}`. The `__eq__` method returns `True` under several conditions: identity (`self is other`), special handling for `Pow` with exponent 1, or after sympification and comparison of `_hashable_content`. To keep it simple, we choose a case where `self` and `other` are both `Symbol('x')` instances. They are not the same object, but their types match (`Symbol`), so the method proceeds to compare `_hashable_content`, which returns `self._args`. For `Symbol('x')`, `_args` is `('x',)`, so equality holds. We represent `self` and `other` as objects with the internal attributes `_mhash`, `_args`, and `_assumptions` set appropriately. This matches the style of the example input, where objects are represented by their internal state.
