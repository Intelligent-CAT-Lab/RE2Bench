The output dictionary contains keys that are strings representing 4-tuples of nonnegative integers summing to 2. Each value is the corresponding multinomial coefficient, which matches the expected coefficients for distributing 2 indistinguishable items into 4 bins. This indicates that the function `multinomial_coefficients(m, n)` was called with m=4 (since tuples have 4 elements) and n=2 (since each tuple sums to 2). Verifying the coefficients: for tuple (2,0,0,0), coefficient = 2!/(2!0!0!0!) = 1; for (1,1,0,0), coefficient = 2!/(1!1!0!0!) = 2, etc. All match. Additionally, the function's branching logic confirms that for m=4 and n=2, the condition `m >= 2*n and n > 1` holds (4 >= 4 and 2 > 1), so it uses `multinomial_coefficients_iterator`, which would produce exactly this set of coefficients. Therefore, the input is m=4, n=2.
