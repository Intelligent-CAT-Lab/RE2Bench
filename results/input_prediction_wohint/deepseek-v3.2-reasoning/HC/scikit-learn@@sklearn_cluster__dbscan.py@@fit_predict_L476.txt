Given the output labels array of length 60 with four clusters (0,1,2,3) and noise points (-1), we need to reconstruct the input X and DBSCAN parameters that would produce this exact labeling. The labels indicate cluster membership: cluster 0 (18 points), cluster 1 (15 points), cluster 2 (19 points), cluster 3 (3 points), and 5 noise points. For DBSCAN to form cluster 3 with only 3 points, min_samples must be ≤ 3; we choose min_samples=3. Eps can be any small positive value (e.g., 0.5) as long as points within each cluster are within eps of each other and clusters are separated by more than eps. We design X such that each cluster's points are co-located at distinct coordinates: cluster 0 at (0,0), cluster 1 at (10,0), cluster 2 at (0,10), cluster 3 at (10,10). Noise points are placed far away at coordinates with distance > eps from any cluster. The order of points in X follows the index order from the output labels, ensuring that clusters are discovered in the order 0,1,2,3 as processing proceeds sequentially. This yields the exact label sequence.
