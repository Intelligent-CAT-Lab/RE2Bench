The function `dmp_zz_wang_hensel_lifting` performs multivariate Hensel lifting, starting from univariate factors modulo a prime `p` and lifting them to bivariate factors over the integers. Given the output factors `[[[1], [1,0]], [[1], [-1,0]]]`, which correspond to `(1 + x)` and `(1 - x)` in bivariate form (with `x` as the main variable and `y` as the secondary variable, but independent of `y`), the input likely consists of the polynomial `f = 1 - x^2` (product of the factors), univariate initial factors `H = [[1,1], [1,-1]]`, leading coefficients `LC = [1, -1]` (the leading coefficients of the univariate factors), evaluation point `A = [0]` (commonly used to reduce to univariate), a prime `p` (e.g., `3`), number of variables `u = 2`, and the integer domain `K = ZZ`.

The algorithm evaluates `f` at `y = 0` to obtain a univariate polynomial, factors it modulo `p`, and then lifts back to bivariate form. Since the factors are independent of `y`, the lifting recovers the same factors but in bivariate representation. The chosen `p` must not be `2` to keep `1` and `-1` distinct modulo `p`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The output factors are bivariate (`u = 2`) and represent `(1 + x)` and `(1 - x)`. Their product is `f = 1 - x^2`.
2. The input `H` should be the univariate factors modulo `p`. For `p` odd, `(1 + x)` and `(1 - x)` are valid modulo `p`, so `H = [[1,1], [1,-1]]` (constant term first).
3. The leading coefficients of these univariate factors are `1` and `-1`, so `LC = [1, -1]`.
4. The evaluation point `A` is chosen for the secondary variable. A common choice is `0`, so `A = [0]`.
5. The prime `p` can be any odd prime, e.g., `3`.
6. The number of variables `u = 2` (bivariate).
7. The domain `K` is the integers `ZZ`.
8. The polynomial `f` is `1 - x^2`, which in bivariate dense recursive form (with `x` as main variable, `y` as secondary) is `[[1], [], [-1]]` (constant term `[1]`, zero linear term `[]`, quadratic term `[-1]`).
9. The algorithm lifts the univariate factors to bivariate form, resulting in the given output.
