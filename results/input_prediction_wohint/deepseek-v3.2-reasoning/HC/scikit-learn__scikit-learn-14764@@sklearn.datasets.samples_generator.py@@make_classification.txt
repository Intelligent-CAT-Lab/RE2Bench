[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows X with shape (50, 2) and y with 50 entries all zeros. Therefore, n_samples=50 and n_features=2.
2. Since y contains only class 0, the class distribution is skewed. This can be achieved by setting n_classes=2 with weights=[1] (which extends to [1, 0]), or n_classes=1. I choose n_classes=2 with weights=[1] to stay close to default behavior, but this requires n_informative ≥ log2(2*2)=2. Given n_features=2, n_informative must be 2, and n_redundant and n_repeated must be 0.
3. No label flips are present, so flip_y=0.0.
4. The values in X are large and centered around (328435.5, -255363.5), indicating a large shift applied. The tight clustering suggests scale=1.0.
5. shift is therefore set to approximately the observed means: [328435.5, -255363.5].
6. Other parameters are set to defaults: class_sep=1.0, hypercube=true, shuffle=false.
7. A fixed random_state (0) is chosen to ensure reproducibility.
