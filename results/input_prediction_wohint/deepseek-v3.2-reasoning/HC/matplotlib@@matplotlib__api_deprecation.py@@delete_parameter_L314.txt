[THOUGHT]
The output is a function object named "func2" from a test. This suggests that `delete_parameter` was called with a function argument `func2`. Since `delete_parameter` returns a wrapper function that wraps `func2`, the input must include `func2`. The parameters `since` and `name` are required. Without further information, I assume typical test values: `since='3.0'` and `name='b'` (common in deprecation tests). The function `func2` likely has a parameter `'b'` that is being deprecated. Therefore, the input is `since='3.0'`, `name='b'`, `func=func2` (the local function defined in the test). Since we cannot serialize the function object in JSON, we represent it by its name and context.
