The output statistics array has 5 elements: 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, nan, 2.5. This suggests that the imputation strategy is likely 'mean', as 2.5 is a typical mean value. The nan for the fourth feature (index 3) indicates that all values in that column are missing, and `keep_empty_features` is False, leading to a nan statistic for that column. To achieve the other statistics, we can design a sparse matrix X with 2 samples and 5 features. For columns 0,1,2, we have one non-missing value (3,2,5 respectively) and one missing value. For column 3, both values are missing. For column 4, both values are non-missing (2 and 3) giving a mean of 2.5. We choose missing_values = -1 for simplicity in JSON representation. The strategy is 'mean', fill_value is irrelevant (set to null), and keep_empty_features is False. X is represented in CSC sparse format with appropriate data, indices, indptr, and shape.
