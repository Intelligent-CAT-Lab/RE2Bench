The output is "1/8", a rational number. The function `polytope_integrate` computes integrals of polynomials over polytopes. For a 2D polygon, the integral of a monomial x^a y^b over a unit square [0,1]×[0,1] is 1/((a+1)(b+1)). To get 1/8, possible monomials include:
- x*y: integral = 1/4, but we need 1/8, so coefficient 1/2 would work.
- x^2*y or x*y^2: integral = 1/6, not 1/8.
- x^2*y^2: integral = 1/9.
- Constant 1: integral = area of polygon. For area 1/8, we could use a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1/4) giving area 1/8.

Given the complexity, likely a simple polygon and polynomial are used. The provided output is a single number, not a dictionary, so `expr` is likely a single polynomial (not a list) and `max_degree` is None. The polygon could be a triangle or square.

We choose the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and polynomial (3/2)*x*y, because the integral of x*y over this triangle is 1/24, and (3/2)*(1/24) = 1/16, not 1/8. Wait recalc: Integral of x*y over triangle (0,0),(1,0),(0,1) is ∫∫ x*y dx dy from 0 to 1, 0 to 1-x = 1/24. To get 1/8, we need coefficient 3, since 3*(1/24)=1/8. So polynomial = 3*x*y.

Alternatively, a constant 1 over a triangle with area 1/8 works. But the triangle (0,0),(1,0),(0,1/4) has area 1/8. That's simpler.

Given the problem, any input yielding 1/8 is acceptable. I'll choose the triangle (0,0),(1,0),(0,1) with polynomial 3*x*y, as it's a common test case.

Thus input:
- poly: Polygon with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)
- expr: 3*x*y
- clockwise: false (default)
- max_degree: None (default)
