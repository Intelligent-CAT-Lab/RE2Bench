Let’s reason through this.  

We’re given a Python class `BivarColormap` with a method `_repr_html_` that generates an HTML representation of the colormap. We have an output JSON containing that HTML, and we need to reconstruct the inputs to `_repr_html_` — which means figuring out what instance of `BivarColormap` produced that output.

---

**Step 1 – Understanding the output structure**  
The output HTML contains:  

1. A title `"BiCone BivarColormap"`.  
2. A base64 PNG image.  
3. Color blocks for `outside` (`#ff00ffff` = magenta with full opacity) and `bad` (`#00000000` = transparent).  
4. The `name` appears in the HTML as `<strong>BiCone</strong>` and in the PNG metadata as `"BiCone BivarColormap"`.  

From the `_repr_html_` method:  
- `title = self.name + ' BivarColormap'` is used in PNG metadata.  
- The `outside` color is from `self.get_outside()` which returns `self._rgba_outside`.  
- The `bad` color is from `self.get_bad()` which returns `self._rgba_bad`.  

From the `__init__` method:  
- `self._rgba_bad = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` → transparent black.  
- `self._rgba_outside = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)` → magenta opaque.  

These match the output’s `outside` and `bad` colors exactly, so the instance used the default `_rgba_outside` and `_rgba_bad`.  

---

**Step 2 – PNG generation details**  
`_repr_png_` uses `self.lut` which depends on `self._init()` being called (only if `self._isinit` is False). `self._init` raises `NotImplementedError` in the base class, so we cannot have called it unless `self._isinit` was already True.  

But `_repr_png_` checks `if not self._isinit: self._init()`. That means for the base `BivarColormap`, calling `_repr_png_` would crash unless `_isinit` is True. But `_isinit` is only set to True in `_init`, which is abstract.  

This suggests the actual instance passed to `_repr_html_` must be from a *subclass* where `_init` is implemented and sets `self._isinit = True`, or `self._isinit` was set to True manually before calling `_repr_html_`. However, the problem only asks for the inputs to `_repr_html_`, meaning the `self` object’s attributes as they would be when passed.  

We only need to provide enough to reconstruct the output. The output shows `outside` and `bad` are defaults, `name = "BiCone"`, and the PNG is generated (so `_isinit` must be True, and `lut` exists).  

---

**Step 3 – Shape inference**  
The `lut` property has logic for `shape == 'circle'` or `'circleignore'` to set alpha to 0 outside radius > 1. But our PNG is a square 256×256 RGBA image (from `_BIVAR_REPR_PNG_SIZE` default likely 256). No way to tell shape from the given output HTML alone, but maybe from the PNG’s base64?  

The PNG is included as base64, but we can’t decode it here to see content. However, the `lut` property’s masking for circle shape would make some pixels transparent (alpha 0) outside the circle. That would affect the PNG. But the `outside` color is magenta (#ff00ff) with alpha 1 in `_rgba_outside`, yet for circle shape, `lut[mask_outside, 3] = 0` overrides alpha to 0 for outside region, making those pixels transparent, not magenta.  

The HTML shows the `outside` color block is magenta with alpha 1 (#ff00ffff), but that’s just the `get_outside()` color swatch; the image itself might have transparent outside pixels if shape is circle.  

Given we can’t inspect PNG, maybe shape is `'square'` (default) or `'ignore'` because only those don’t mask alpha in `lut`. But the `lut` is created in `_init` in a subclass; we don’t know its content.  

---

**Step 4 – Default vs. custom parameters**  
`__init__` parameters:  
- `N=256`, `M=256`, `shape='square'`, `origin=(0,0)`, `name='bivariate colormap'`.  

Our output has `name='BiCone'`, so that’s explicitly passed.  
Other attributes: `N=256`, `M=256`, `shape='square'`, `origin=(0,0)` likely defaults unless specified otherwise.  

---

**Step 5 – Determine input format**  
The input format example from the earlier problem was:  

```json
{
    "self": { ... object attributes ... },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

Here `_repr_html_` is an instance method with no extra args, so `args` and `kwargs` should be empty.  
We must represent `self` as an object with the attributes that produce the given output.  

Required attributes from output:  
- `name = "BiCone"`  
- `_rgba_outside = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)` (default)  
- `_rgba_bad = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (default)  
- `_isinit = True` (otherwise PNG generation would crash)  
- `_lut` exists, but we don’t need to specify it if `_isinit` is True? Actually, `lut` property calls `self._init()` if not `_isinit`, so to avoid crash, `_isinit` must be True.  
- `N`, `M`, `shape`, `origin` likely defaults.  

---

**Step 6 – Shape decision**  
The `outside` swatch in HTML is magenta with alpha 1. If shape were `'circle'`, the PNG outside region would be transparent (alpha 0), but the swatch for `outside` would still show magenta (since `get_outside()` returns the same regardless of shape). So we can’t decide shape from output alone.  

Given no evidence otherwise, assume default `shape='square'`.  

---

**Step 7 – Build the input JSON**  

We create a `self` dict with:  
- `name`  
- `_isinit`  
- `_shape`  
- `_rgba_outside`  
- `_rgba_bad`  
- `N`, `M`, `_origin` as in `__init__` defaults.  

We also need `_lut`? The PNG is generated from `self.lut`, which for `shape='square'` just returns a copy of `self._lut`. So `self._lut` must be a valid RGBA array of shape `(N, M, 4)`. We don’t know its content, but we can assume it’s initialized in `_init`. Since we can’t reproduce the exact PNG, maybe the problem expects us to just specify that `_isinit = True` and `_lut` is some dummy array? But the example didn’t specify internal array data; they just set attributes needed to produce the given output path.  

Looking back at the example, they only specified `_given_basetemp`, `_trace`, `_basetemp` for `self` — only the attributes that affected the output path. So here, only attributes that affect `_repr_html_` output are: `name`, `_isinit=True`, `shape`, `N`, `M`, `_rgba_outside`, `_rgba_bad`.  

---

**Step 8 – Final input**  

```json
{
    "self": {
        "name": "BiCone",
        "_isinit": true,
        "_shape": "square",
        "_rgba_outside": [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        "_rgba_bad": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        "N": 256,
        "M": 256,
        "_origin": [0.0, 0.0]
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

[THOUGHT]
1. The output HTML contains name "BiCone", outside color magenta, bad color transparent — matching defaults for `_rgba_outside` and `_rgba_bad`.
2. PNG generation requires `_isinit = True` to avoid NotImplementedError from `_init`.
3. Shape cannot be inferred from given output (outside color swatch is same regardless of shape), so assume default `'square'`.
4. Input format follows example: `self` with attributes affecting output, `args` and `kwargs` empty.
