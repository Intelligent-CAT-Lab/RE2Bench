The output is a 2x4 array with values [[ 1., nan,  1.,  0.], [-1.,  0.,  0.,  1.]]. To produce this output, the simplest scenario is a ColumnTransformer where all transformers are set to 'passthrough', meaning the input data is returned unchanged. Therefore, the input data X must be exactly this 2x4 array. The ColumnTransformer must be fitted such that it has four transformers, each applied to a single column, all using 'passthrough'. The fitted state includes transformers_ as a list of (name, transformer, columns) tuples, with transformer being 'passthrough' for each. Additionally, _remainder is set to 'drop' with no remaining columns, _n_features is 4, sparse_output_ is False (since the output is dense), and _columns reflects the column indices. This setup ensures that when transform is called on X, each column is passed through and stacked to form the same array, matching the output.
