[THOUGHT]
1. The output is "n + n**(-n)", a simplified symbolic expression.
2. The `simplify` function applies a series of transformations, including rational simplification via `cancel` and `together`.
3. A non-trivial input that simplifies to this output is the rational expression \((n^{n+1} + 1) / n^n\), because canceling the fraction yields \(n + n^{-n}\).
4. Trivial inputs like \(n + n^{-n}\) would produce the same output but are less likely given the problem context.
5. Other parameters (`ratio`, `measure`, `rational`) are assumed to be defaults, so only the expression argument is needed.
