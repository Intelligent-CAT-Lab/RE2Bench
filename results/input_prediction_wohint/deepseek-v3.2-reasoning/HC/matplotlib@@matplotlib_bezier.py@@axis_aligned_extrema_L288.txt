[THOUGHT]
1. The output of `axis_aligned_extrema` is a tuple of two empty arrays. This can happen in two scenarios: either the degree of the Bézier curve is less than or equal to 1, or the derivative polynomials have no real roots in the interval [0, 1].
2. The simplest way to guarantee empty arrays is to ensure the degree is ≤ 1, as the method returns empty arrays immediately in that case.
3. A Bézier curve of degree 1 has two control points. For example, using control points `[[0, 0], [1, 1]]` results in a linear curve.
4. With these control points, `_N = 2`, `_d = 2`, `_orders = [0, 1]`, and `_px` is computed as the same as the control points due to the binomial coefficients being 1.
5. When `axis_aligned_extrema` is called on such an instance, `n = self.degree = 1`, so the condition `n <= 1` is true, and the method returns `(np.array([]), np.array([]))`, matching the given output.
