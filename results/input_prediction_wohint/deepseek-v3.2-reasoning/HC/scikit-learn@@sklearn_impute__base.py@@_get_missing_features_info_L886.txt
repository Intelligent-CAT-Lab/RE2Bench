[THOUGHT]
The output consists of two arrays: a boolean mask with shape (10,2) showing True on rows 0,2,4,6,8 and False on rows 1,3,5,7,9, and features indices [0,1]. This suggests that the input data X has missing values in alternating rows for both columns. To avoid JSON serialization issues with np.nan, I choose missing_values = -1, which is JSON-serializable. X is constructed as a list of lists with -1 in even-indexed rows and 0 in odd-indexed rows. The MissingIndicator instance has attributes: missing_values = -1, features = 'missing-only' (or 'all', but 'missing-only' is explicit), sparse = 'auto' to keep the mask dense, error_on_new = True (unused but default), and _precomputed = False since we are computing the mask from X. The function call is _get_missing_features_info(self, X) with X as the only argument besides self.
