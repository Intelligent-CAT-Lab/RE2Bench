1. Analyze the output: The output is a tuple (mat_flat, pivot_cols, swaps). The mat_flat has 9 elements, so likely a 3x3 matrix. pivot_cols = [0,1,2] and swaps = [].
2. The matrix is upper triangular with entries: row0: [-9,-17,-19]; row1: [0,-8,-37]; row2: [0,0,-243]. Since swaps are empty, no row swaps occurred.
3. The algorithm performs fraction-free Gaussian elimination with parameters normalize_last, normalize, zero_above. Since the pivots are not 1, normalization did not occur, so normalize must be False, and since normalization didn't happen immediately (which would happen if normalize_last=False), we need normalize_last=True. Also, the matrix has non-zero entries above the diagonal, so zero_above must be False.
4. To find an original matrix that reduces to this, we work backwards through the elimination steps. Let the original matrix be A. The algorithm does: at step k, pivot at (k,k), multiply rows below by pivot and subtract to eliminate below-diagonal entries.
5. From the output, row0 is unchanged, so A[0] = [-9,-17,-19].
6. Let A[1] = [a10, a11, a12]. After step 0, row1 becomes [0, p0*a11 - a10*a01, p0*a12 - a10*a02] where p0 = A[0,0] = -9, a01=-17, a02=-19. Set equal to [0,-8,-37] gives two equations.
7. Let A[2] = [a20, a21, a22]. After step 0, row2 becomes [0, p0*a21 - a20*a01, p0*a22 - a20*a02]. After step 1, row2 is further transformed. Equating the final row2[2] gives another equation.
8. Choose integers to satisfy these equations. One solution is: a10=8, a11=16, a12=21; a20=0, a21=-1, a22=-8.
9. Verify that with these values, the algorithm produces the given output.
10. The other parameters: rows=3, cols=3, one=1 (multiplicative identity), iszerofunc and simpfunc are the provided functions _iszero and _simplify. Since the output is simple, these functions behave normally.
Thus the input to _row_reduce_list is as given.
