1. The output "cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2" simplifies to (1 + cos(2*phi))/2, which is a known trigonometric identity for cos²(phi).
2. TR8 is designed to simplify products and powers of trigonometric functions into sums using product-to-sum identities.
3. Consider the input rv = cos(phi)**2. This is a power of cosine.
4. Simulate TR8 on cos(phi)**2 with first=True (default):
   - Since rv is a Pow with base cos(phi) and exponent 2, it satisfies the condition for processing.
   - With first=True, the expression is split into numerator and denominator: n = cos(phi)**2, d = 1.
   - TR8 is called recursively on n with first=False.
   - Mul.make_args(cos(phi)**2) yields (cos(phi), cos(phi)).
   - Arguments are collected: c = [phi, phi] (cosine arguments), s = [] (sine arguments).
   - Because len(c) > 1, simplification proceeds.
   - The two cosine terms are combined: (cos(phi+phi) + cos(phi-phi))/2 = (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2.
   - The resulting expression is (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2.
   - TR8 is called recursively on this result (with first=True by default).
   - The expression is a Mul of 1/2 and (cos(2*phi) + 1). No further simplification occurs.
   - The final output is (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2 = cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2.
5. Alternative inputs like cos(phi)*cos(phi) would produce the same output.
6. Thus, the most straightforward input is rv = cos(phi)**2 with first = True.
