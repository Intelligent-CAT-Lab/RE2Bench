The function `_osborne(e, d)` transforms hyperbolic functions in expression `e` to trigonometric functions by scaling the arguments by `d`. Given the output expression `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x) + I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)`, I need to find `e` and `d` that yield this after transformation.

First, observe that the output contains `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` with the same argument `_Dummy_196*x`. This suggests the input involves hyperbolic functions `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` with an argument that, when scaled by `d`, becomes `_Dummy_196*x`. The transformations are:
- `sinh(a) -> I*sin(a)`
- `cosh(a) -> cos(a)`
- `tanh(a) -> I*tan(a)`

The output has a term `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x)`, which could come from `-sinh(x)` transformed with `d` such that `x*d = _Dummy_196*x`, implying `d = _Dummy_196`. Similarly, `I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)` could come from `cosh(x)*tanh(x)` transformed, giving `cos(x*d) * I*tan(x*d) = I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)`.

Thus, `e = -sinh(x) + cosh(x)*tanh(x)` and `d = _Dummy_196`. This yields the exact output after applying `_osborne`.

In the input, `x` is a symbol, and `_Dummy_196` is a dummy variable (likely a sympy Dummy symbol). The expressions are represented as strings for JSON compatibility.
