[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `{"output": null}`, indicating that the `add` method executed successfully without error and returned `None`.
2. The `add` method can accept various inputs. To minimize complexity, we choose an empty signature `()` and a function without annotations. This will add an entry for an empty tuple signature to `self.funcs`.
3. The `self` object must be an instance of `Dispatcher` with attributes `funcs`, `_cache`, `ordering`, and `name` (and optionally `doc`). For a successful call, these can be empty/default.
4. The function must be callable and have no annotations to avoid the annotation branch. A built-in function like `len` satisfies this.
5. The `on_ambiguity` parameter is left as default, so we omit it in the input.
