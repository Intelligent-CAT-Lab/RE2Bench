The output of `_validate_y_class_weight` is a tuple containing the transformed `y` and `expanded_class_weight`. From the provided output:
- The transformed `y` is a 10x1 numpy array with values 0 and 1, indicating binary classification with 10 samples.
- `expanded_class_weight` is `null` (None), meaning it was not computed.

To achieve this output:
1. **Transformed `y`**: This is derived from input `y` by mapping unique class labels to indices (0 and 1). Since the output `y` has values 0 and 1, input `y` should have the same shape (10 samples, 1 output) and contain values that map to these indices. The simplest case is input `y` being the same array: a 10x1 array with values 0 and 1 as shown.
2. **`expanded_class_weight` being None**: This occurs if `self.class_weight` is `None`, or if `self.class_weight` is `'balanced_subsample'` and `self.bootstrap` is `True`. To keep it simple, assume `self.class_weight` is `None`, so the condition to compute `expanded_class_weight` is skipped.
3. **`self.n_outputs_`**: The function uses `self.n_outputs_` in a loop to process each output column. Since output `y` has one column, `self.n_outputs_` must be 1 for the function to work correctly.
4. **Other `self` attributes**: `self.bootstrap` is used in the condition for `expanded_class_weight`, but with `class_weight` as `None`, it doesn't affect the output. Set it to `false` for simplicity. Attributes like `classes_` and `n_classes_` are set inside the function, so they can be ignored or set to empty in the input.

Thus, the input should have:
- `self` with `class_weight` as `null`, `bootstrap` as `false`, and `n_outputs_` as 1.
- `y` as a 2D array-like object (e.g., list of lists) with 10 rows and 1 column, containing the values [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1].

The input format follows the example: a JSON with "self" object, "args" for the positional argument `y`, and empty "kwargs".
