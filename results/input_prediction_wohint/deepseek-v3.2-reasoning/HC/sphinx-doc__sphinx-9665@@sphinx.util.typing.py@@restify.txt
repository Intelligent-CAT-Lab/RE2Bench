[THOUGHT]
The function `restify` returns `":py:obj:`None`"` when the input `cls` is either `None` or `NoneType` (i.e., `type(None)`). Given the JSON output format, the input must be representable in JSON. The value `None` can be represented as `null`, while `NoneType` (a Python type object) cannot be directly represented in standard JSON without additional encoding. Therefore, the most plausible input is `cls = None`, which corresponds to `null` in JSON. This matches the first condition in the function and produces the desired output.
