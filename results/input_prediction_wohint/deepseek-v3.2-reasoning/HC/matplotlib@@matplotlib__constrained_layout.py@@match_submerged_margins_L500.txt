[THOUGHT]
To produce an output list containing two axes objects, the function `match_submerged_margins` must be called with a figure that has exactly two axes meeting the criteria: each axis has a subplotspec, is in layout, and their gridspecs are present in `layoutgrids`. To avoid complex margin calculations and ensure the axes are not removed or altered, we design a minimal configuration:

1. The figure has no subfigs (`subfigs = []`).
2. The figure has two axes, each occupying a single cell in a 1x2 grid (so `ncols=2`, `nrows=1`). This ensures `colspan` and `rowspan` are of length 1, bypassing the interior margin update blocks.
3. Both axes share the same gridspec, which is included as a key in `layoutgrids`.
4. The layoutgrid associated with the gridspec has dummy `margin_vals` arrays of appropriate lengths (2 for columns, 1 for rows) and the required keys (`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, and their `cb` counterparts). The values are zeros since they are not used.
5. The axes are set to be in layout (`get_in_layout()` returns `True`), and their subplotspecs return the gridspec key that matches the one in `layoutgrids`.

This setup ensures that during execution:
- No axes are added to `axsdone` from subfigs.
- Both axes are collected in `axs`.
- Neither axis is removed because their gridspec is in `layoutgrids`.
- No margin updates occur because `len(colspan) == 1` and `len(rowspan) == 1`.
- The function returns the original `axs` list unchanged, containing the two axes.

Thus, the input JSON should represent this structure, with objects having the necessary attributes and methods simulated via internal state (e.g., `_subplotspec`, `_in_layout`). The `layoutgrids` dictionary uses a string key (`"gridspec1"`) for simplicity, and the subplotspecs reference this key.
