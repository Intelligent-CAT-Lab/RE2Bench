[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this carefully. We have a `SelectorMixin.transform` method and we're given its output. The output is a 30x2 numpy array with floating point values.

Looking at the `transform` method:
1. It gets tags from `self._get_tags()` 
2. It validates X with `check_array`
3. It gets a support mask via `self.get_support()` (which calls `self._get_support_mask()`)
4. If mask is empty, returns empty array
5. Checks that mask length equals X.shape[1]
6. Returns `X[:, safe_mask(X, mask)]` - selects columns where mask is True

The output is 30x2, so:
- Input X must have 30 rows (since shape[0] is preserved)
- The mask must have exactly 2 True values (selecting 2 columns)
- Total number of features (columns) in original X is unknown, but mask length = X.shape[1]

From the output values, I can see this looks like the Iris dataset (or similar) with 2 selected features. The values appear to be measurements.

Since the output is 30x2, and it looks like a subset of a larger dataset (possibly 150 samples of Iris, but here 30), X could be 30xn where n > 2, and the mask selects 2 specific columns.

Looking at potential selector implementations:
1. `SelectFromModel` - uses feature importances/coefficients
2. `RFE` - uses `self.support_`
3. `VarianceThreshold` - uses variances > threshold

I need to reconstruct the input X and the state of the selector. The mask selects 2 columns. Without knowing which selector type, I'll assume it's a simple case where we can directly set the mask.

However, looking at the provided functions, I see implementations for various selectors. The output doesn't give clues about which selector, so I need to make reasonable assumptions.

Actually, looking more carefully at the transform method:
- It calls `self._get_tags()` which for `VarianceThreshold` returns `{'allow_nan': True}`
- Then `check_array` is called with `force_all_finite=not tags.get('allow_nan', True)`
- For VarianceThreshold, this would be `force_all_finite=False` (since allow_nan=True)
- But for other selectors, it might be True

Since the output contains regular numeric values (no NaN), either setting works.

The simplest approach: create a selector with a mask that selects 2 columns, and X with 30 rows and some number of columns where those 2 columns match the output.

Let me assume:
- X has 4 columns total (like Iris dataset)
- The mask selects columns 2 and 3 (0-indexed) or columns 0 and 1
- I'll choose columns 2 and 3 to match typical Iris petal features

So:
- mask = [False, False, True, True] (selecting last 2 columns)
- X should be 30x4 where columns 2 and 3 are the output values
- Columns 0 and 1 can be arbitrary values (I'll use zeros)

Now for the selector state. If using VarianceThreshold:
- Need `self.variances_` array of length 4
- Need `self.threshold` such that variances_[2] and variances_[3] > threshold
- Others <= threshold

Let me set:
- variances_ = [0.01, 0.02, 1.0, 0.8] (last two > threshold)
- threshold = 0.5

Alternatively, if using RFE:
- Need `self.support_ = [False, False, True, True]`
- Need to pass `check_is_fitted` (has attributes ending with _)

I'll use VarianceThreshold as it's simpler.

For X: I need to parse the output string into a 30x2 array, then create a 30x4 array with first two columns as zeros.

Let me parse the output:
```
[[1.5 0.2]
 [1.6 0.2]
 ...
 [5.  1.5]]
```

So I'll construct X where:
- X[:, 0] = zeros
- X[:, 1] = zeros  
- X[:, 2] = first column of output
- X[:, 3] = second column of output
