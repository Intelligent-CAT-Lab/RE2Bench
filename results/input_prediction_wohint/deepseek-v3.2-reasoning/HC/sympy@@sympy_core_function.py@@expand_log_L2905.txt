[THOUGHT]
The output is "log(2)". The function `expand_log` expands logarithmic expressions. One nontrivial input that simplifies to `log(2)` is `log(4)/2`. When `expand_log` is called on this input with default parameters, the condition in the `replace` method fails because the denominator lacks a logarithmic factor. Then, the expression is sympified and expanded with `log=True`, which expands `log(4)` to `2*log(2)`, resulting in `log(2)`. Other inputs like `log(8)/3` or `log(2)*log(4)/log(4)` also work, but `log(4)/2` is a simple and clear example.
