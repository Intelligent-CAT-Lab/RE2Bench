[THOUGHT]
The output {"0": 1} indicates that the polynomial has a single root at 0 with multiplicity 1. The simplest polynomial with this property is \(x\) (i.e., \(1 \cdot x + 0\)). The `roots` function can accept a list of coefficients representing the polynomial in descending order. Providing `f = [1, 0]` corresponds to the polynomial \(x\), which will yield the root 0 with multiplicity 1. No additional generators are needed when `f` is a list (the code raises an error if gens are provided), and no special flags are required. Thus, the input should be `roots([1, 0])`.
