[THOUGHT]
1. The output expression is `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`.
2. The function `factor_terms` is designed to factor out common terms from an expression, particularly from sums. The output has a denominator factored as `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`, suggesting the input likely had an additive form in the denominator, such as `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2`, from which `a**2` can be factored out.
3. Simulating `factor_terms` on `expr = (2*x)/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`:
   - The expression is a `Mul`: `2*x * (a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)**(-1)`.
   - `factor_terms` extracts the numerical coefficient `2` via `as_content_primitive`, leaving `x * (denom)**(-1)`.
   - The denominator is an `Add`: `a**2*x^2 - a**2*y^2`. `as_content_primitive` extracts the common factor `a**2`, giving `a**2*(x^2 - y^2)`.
   - After processing, the expression becomes `2 * x / (a**2*(x^2 - y^2))`, matching the output.
4. Other inputs could produce the same output, but the expanded denominator form is the most plausible given the purpose of `factor_terms`. The function was likely called with default values for `radical`, `clear`, `fraction`, and `sign`.
