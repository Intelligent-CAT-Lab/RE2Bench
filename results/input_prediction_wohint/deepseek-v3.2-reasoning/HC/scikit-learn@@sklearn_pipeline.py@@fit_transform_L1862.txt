[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 2x4 numpy array. To produce this output, the `fit_transform` method must return exactly this array.
2. The `FeatureUnion` horizontally stacks the outputs of each transformer. If there is only one transformer, the output is that transformer's output.
3. We can set up the `FeatureUnion` with one transformer being `'passthrough'` (which becomes a `FunctionTransformer` that returns the input unchanged) and another transformer being `'drop'` (which is ignored). Then the output of the `FeatureUnion` will be the input `X` itself.
4. Therefore, if we set `X` to the desired output array, the `fit_transform` method will return that array.
5. We set `y` to `None` and no additional parameters (`kwargs`). The `FeatureUnion` is configured with default values for other attributes (`n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`, etc.).
