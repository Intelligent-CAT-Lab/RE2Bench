1. The output is a 38x3 array with each row equal to [0.33928571, 0.33035714, 0.33035714]. This pattern suggests the `predict_proba` method is using the 'prior' strategy, which returns constant class probabilities for all samples.

2. For the 'prior' strategy, the output is `class_prior_` repeated for each sample. Thus, `class_prior_` must be approximately [0.33928571, 0.33035714, 0.33035714]. These values correspond to fractions 38/112, 37/112, and 37/112.

3. The number of samples is 38, so `X` must have 38 rows. The content of `X` is irrelevant for a dummy classifier, so any shape with 38 samples works.

4. The estimator must be fitted with:
   - `n_outputs_ = 1` (since output is a single array, not a list of arrays).
   - `n_classes_ = 3` (three columns in output).
   - `classes_` can be any three distinct labels, e.g., [0, 1, 2].
   - `class_prior_ = [38/112, 37/112, 37/112]` as floats.
   - `_strategy = 'prior'` (used in the method).
   - `strategy = 'prior'` (initial parameter).
   - `random_state = None` (unused for 'prior').
   - `constant = None` (unused for 'prior').

5. The input `X` is set to a list of 38 sublists, each containing a single zero, ensuring 38 samples.
