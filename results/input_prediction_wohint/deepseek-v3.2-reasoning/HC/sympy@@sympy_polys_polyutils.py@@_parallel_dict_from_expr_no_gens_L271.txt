[THOUGHT]
The output consists of a polynomial representation and a generator list. The polynomial has one term: the monomial (1,) with coefficient 1, indicating a linear term in the generator. The generator list contains "cos(phi)". This matches the processing of the expression cos(phi) by the function `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens`. For cos(phi), the function identifies it as a non-coefficient factor (since it's not a number under default options), decomposes it to base cos(phi) and exponent 1, adds cos(phi) to the generator set, and constructs a polynomial with the monomial (1,) and coefficient 1. The options must be set so that cos(phi) is not treated as a coefficient (e.g., domain=None, extension=False, greedy=False) and series=False to use decompose_power. The input is therefore exprs = [cos(phi)] with appropriate options.
