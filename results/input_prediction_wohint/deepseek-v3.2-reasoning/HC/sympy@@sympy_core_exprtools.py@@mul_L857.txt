[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs to Term.mul that produce the output Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})). The mul method multiplies coefficients and factors, then normalizes by canceling common factors between numerator and denominator. For the result to have coefficient 1 and empty factors, a simple case is when both self and other are Term(1) (i.e., coefficient 1, empty factors). Then product yields coefficient 1 * 1 = 1, numerator product Factors({}) * Factors({}) = Factors({}), denominator product similarly empty, and normalization returns (Factors({}), Factors({})). This results in Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})). Thus input can be self = Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})) and other = Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})).
