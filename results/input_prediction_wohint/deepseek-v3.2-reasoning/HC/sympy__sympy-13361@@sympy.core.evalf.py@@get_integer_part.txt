The function `get_integer_part` computes the integer part of the real and imaginary components of a complex expression, with rounding direction controlled by `no`. The output `[32769, 0]` indicates integer parts 32769 (real) and 0 (imaginary). This suggests a real expression with value between 32769 and 32770 (if using floor rounding) or exactly 32769 (if using ceiling). A simple choice is `32769.5` with `no = -1` (floor) to yield the desired output. The imaginary part is zero because the expression is real.
