The output is "2500/pi", which is a string representation of a sympy expression. The function sympify can produce such an expression from various inputs. The most straightforward way is to pass a string "2500/pi" as the first argument. Other arguments can be left as defaults because they do not affect the parsing of this string. Specifically:
- The string will be parsed by parse_expr, which will interpret "2500/pi" as a division of 2500 by the constant pi.
- The parameters convert_xor, strict, rational, and evaluate do not alter the result for this input.
- There is no need for locals because pi is a built-in sympy constant.
Thus, the input should be a="2500/pi" with default values for the other parameters.
