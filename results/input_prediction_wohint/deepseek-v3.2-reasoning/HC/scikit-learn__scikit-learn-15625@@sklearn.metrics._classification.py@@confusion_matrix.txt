The output confusion matrix is a 2x2 matrix with diagonal entries 9 and 11 and zeros off-diagonal. This indicates perfect classification for two classes, with 9 samples of class A correctly predicted and 11 samples of class B correctly predicted. The function confusion_matrix expects y_true and y_pred as arrays. With no normalization and default sample_weight (ones), the matrix entries are counts of samples for each (true, predicted) pair. To get diagonal counts 9 and 11, we can set y_true = [0]*9 + [1]*11 and y_pred identical. This yields exactly 9 (0,0) and 11 (1,1) pairs. The labels parameter can be omitted, as unique_labels will return [0,1] sorted. The order of labels in the matrix is sorted, so class 0 corresponds to first row/column. Thus the matrix will be as given. No other arguments are needed.
