[THOUGHT]
We are given the output of `_symbolic_factor_list`: a tuple with coefficient 1 and a list containing one factor, which is a Poly object representing `cos(phi)` as a polynomial in `cos(phi)` with domain `ZZ` and exponent 1. This suggests that the input expression is likely just `cos(phi)`. For the function to produce a Poly object, the `opt` parameter must specify the generator as `cos(phi)` (so that `_poly_from_expr` succeeds). The method can be either `'sqf'` or `'factor_list'`, as both would yield the same result for a linear, irreducible polynomial. We choose `'sqf'` for concreteness. The `opt` object should have attributes `gens` (list containing `cos(phi)`), `domain` (`ZZ` or `None`), `expand` (`True`), and `polys` (`None`). In JSON, we represent the expression and generators as strings that SymPy can parse.
