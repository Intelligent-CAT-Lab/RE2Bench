The output is a ratio of products of RisingFactorials: 
  RisingFactorial(u+v+1, -v) * RisingFactorial(u+v+4, -v) / (RisingFactorial(u+v-1, -v) * RisingFactorial(u+v+3, -v)).
This suggests the original product is over a rational function that factors into linear terms in the index variable. Each RisingFactorial corresponds to a product of linear factors over the index range.

The form RisingFactorial(x, k) = ∏_{j=0}^{k-1} (x+j) indicates that if the product is taken over index i from a to n, then n - a + 1 = -v (the second argument). Choosing a = 0 gives n = -v - 1. The linear factors in the numerator are (i + u+v+1) and (i + u+v+4), and in the denominator are (i + u+v-1) and (i + u+v+3). Thus the term is:
  (i + u + v + 1)*(i + u + v + 4) / ((i + u + v - 1)*(i + u + v + 3)).
The limits are (i, 0, -v-1).

The _eval_product method will handle this as a rational function, splitting it into numerator and denominator products, each evaluated via the polynomial case (since each polynomial is linear in i), yielding the RisingFactorials.

Therefore, the input to _eval_product should be this term and these limits, with index i.
