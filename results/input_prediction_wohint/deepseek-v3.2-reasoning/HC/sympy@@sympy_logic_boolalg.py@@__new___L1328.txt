[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a string representation of an `Equivalent` object with two arguments: `Q.even(X*Z)` and `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`. 
2. The `Equivalent.__new__` method processes arguments based on the `evaluate` flag. If `evaluate` is `False` or `None` (with `global_parameters.evaluate` set to `False`), it returns the `Equivalent` without simplification. If `evaluate` is `True`, it applies simplifications like removing duplicates, handling relationals, and converting numbers to booleans.
3. The given arguments are `AppliedPredicate` and `Or` objects, not numbers or relationals, so no simplification occurs regardless of the `evaluate` flag. The `Equivalent` is returned with both arguments.
4. The `ordered` function sorts arguments, but the output order matches a likely sorted order (since `Q.even(X*Z)` is simpler than the disjunction). The input order could be either the same or reversed; we choose the same order for simplicity.
5. The first argument to `__new__` is the class `Equivalent`, represented as a string in JSON.
6. The `evaluate` flag can be omitted (default `None`) or set to `False`; both yield the same output. We omit it for simplicity, leaving `kwargs` empty.
7. Thus, the input consists of `self` as `"Equivalent"`, `args` as the two string expressions, and an empty `kwargs`.
