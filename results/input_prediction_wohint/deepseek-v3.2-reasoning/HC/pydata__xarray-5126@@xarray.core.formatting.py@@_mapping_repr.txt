The output is "Attributes:\n    foo:      bar". This matches the pattern produced by `_mapping_repr` when called with:
- `title="Attributes"`
- `mapping` containing one key "foo" with value "bar"
- `summarizer=summarize_attr` (since the formatting matches `summarize_attr` output)
- `expand_option_name="display_expand_attrs"` (default expansion is True)
- `col_width=None` (computed internally)
- `max_rows=None` (default from OPTIONS)

The `col_width` is computed by `_calculate_col_width(mapping)` based on the longest key string. For key "foo" (length 3), `col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`. The `summarize_attr` function formats the key with padding to `col_width`, resulting in "    foo:" followed by 5 spaces (total 13 chars), then a space and "bar", giving 6 spaces between colon and "bar" as seen.

The mapping is likely a dictionary-like object (e.g., `xarray.core.common.AttrAccessMixin` or plain dict). Since the function is called from `attrs_repr` partial, the fixed parameters are title, summarizer, and expand_option_name. The input to `_mapping_repr` would therefore include these fixed parameters and the mapping.

We represent the input as JSON with "args" for positional arguments (here just the mapping) and "kwargs" for keyword arguments. The function `summarize_attr` cannot be serialized directly, so we use a string identifier.

Thus, the predicted input is a dictionary with "args" containing the mapping and "kwargs" containing the other parameters.
