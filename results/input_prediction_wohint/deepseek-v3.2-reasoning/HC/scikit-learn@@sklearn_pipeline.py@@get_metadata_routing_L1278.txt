[THOUGHT]
The output shows a MetadataRouter with a single consumer named 'consumesmetadata'. Its mapping list matches the method mapping constructed for the final step of a Pipeline when the estimator does not have fit_transform. The router indicates the estimator consumes metadata in fit and predict. Since only one consumer appears, the Pipeline likely has a single step. Therefore, the input Pipeline object should have steps = [('consumesmetadata', estimator)] where estimator has a _metadata_request attribute (or equivalent) yielding {'fit': {'metadata': True}, 'predict': {'metadata': True}} and no fit_transform method. Other attributes can be defaults.
