[THOUGHT]
To produce an output of `null` from `_assert_lower`, we need the function to return `None`. The function returns `None` in two cases: (1) if `ci <= xi.lower`, or (2) if `xi.lower < ci <= xi.upper` and no conflict arises. The simplest path is the first one, where `ci` is less than or equal to `xi.lower`, causing an early return.

We need to construct a `self` object (an instance of `LRASolver`) and arguments `xi` and `ci` that satisfy this condition. Since the early return path does not access most attributes of `self`, we can define a minimal `self` with only the necessary attributes to avoid errors. We'll set `self.result = None` and other attributes to empty or default values. For `xi`, we define it with a `lower` attribute that is a tuple-like structure (represented as a list) that is greater than `ci`. We'll represent rational numbers as `[numerator, denominator]` and strictness flags as integers. Specifically, let `xi.lower = [[10, 1], 0]` (meaning non-strict lower bound of 10) and `ci = [[5, 1], 0]` (non-strict lower bound of 5). Then `ci <= xi.lower` holds, and the function returns `None` immediately.

The `self` object is given with attributes from `__init__`, set to empty or false values to avoid side effects. We also set `run_checks = False` to bypass the final assertion if it were reached (though it won't be). The `from_equality` and `from_neg` parameters are left as default (`False`) since they are not used in this path.

Thus, the predicted input will cause `_assert_lower` to return `None`, matching the output.
