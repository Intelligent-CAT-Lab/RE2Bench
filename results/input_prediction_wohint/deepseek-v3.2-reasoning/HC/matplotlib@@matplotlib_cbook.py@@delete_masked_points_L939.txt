The output consists of two arrays of length 10 and a null (None). The function `delete_masked_points` processes variable arguments, removing masked or non-finite points. The arrays in the output are unchanged (length 10), indicating no points were removed. The null in the output suggests the third argument was not a sequence (or was None) and remained unmodified. Therefore, the input likely includes two sequences of length 10 (lists or arrays) with no masked or non-finite values, and a third argument that is None. The sequences correspond to the arrays shown: first from 0.0 to 0.45 in steps of 0.05, second from 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05. The simplest input is two lists and a None.
