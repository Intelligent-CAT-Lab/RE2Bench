[THOUGHT]
The output of `_get_kernel_params` is a dictionary containing `coef0` and `degree` with specific values (0.1 and 3.1). This suggests that the kernel type is likely 'poly' (polynomial), as it is the only common kernel in scikit-learn that uses both parameters. The method first initializes `params` with `self.kernel_params` (or an empty dict if None). Then, if the kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed', it iterates over the parameters defined in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` and adds those that are not None from the corresponding instance attributes. Since the output includes only `coef0` and `degree`, we infer:
- `self.kernel` must be 'poly' (so that `KERNEL_PARAMS['poly']` includes `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`).
- `self.coef0` is 0.1 and `self.degree` is 3.1.
- `self.gamma` must be None (otherwise it would appear in the output).
- `self.kernel_params` must be None or an empty dict (otherwise additional keys might appear).
The method does not depend on other attributes like `n_components` or `random_state`, but they can be set to default values for completeness.
