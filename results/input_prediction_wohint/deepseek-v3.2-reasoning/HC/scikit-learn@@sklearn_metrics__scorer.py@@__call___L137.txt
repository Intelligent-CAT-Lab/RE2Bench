[THOUGHT]
The output indicates that the `__call__` method of `_MultimetricScorer` returns `{"score": -Infinity}`. This implies:
- `self._scorers` has a single scorer named `"score"`.
- The scorer returns `-Infinity` when called with the provided arguments.
- `self._raise_exc` is `True` (no exception raised).
- Since only one scorer exists, `_use_cache` returns `False`, so `cache` is `None`.
- We assume `_routing_enabled()` is `False` for simplicity, so `routed_params` is built from `common_kwargs`.
- `kwargs` is empty, so `common_kwargs` and `routed_params` are empty.
- The scorer must be callable and return `-Infinity`. A plausible way is to use the `neg_log_loss` scorer (`_BaseScorer` with `_score_func=log_loss`, `_sign=-1`), which yields `-Infinity` when the true class has predicted probability 0.
- To achieve this, we set:
  - `estimator` with a `predict_proba` method returning `[[1.0, 0.0]]` for a single sample.
  - `X` as `[[0]]` (any input).
  - `y_true` as `[1]` (true class 1, predicted probability 0).
- This results in `log_loss([1], [[1.0, 0.0]])` = `Infinity`, and `neg_log_loss` = `-Infinity`.
- The scorer is configured as a `_BaseScorer` with these attributes.
- `kwargs` is empty.
