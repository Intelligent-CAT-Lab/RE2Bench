We need to reconstruct the input to `_parallel_poly_from_expr` that yields the given output. The output consists of two polynomials in terms of `cos(phi)` with integer coefficients, and the options show `gens = [cos(phi)]`, `domain = ZZ`, and `polys = false`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The two output polynomials are `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` and `Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`. This corresponds to expressions `2` and `-2*cos(phi)`.
2. The `polys` flag in the output is `false`, indicating no Poly objects were present in the input (or they were converted). Thus, the input expressions are likely not Poly instances.
3. The domain is `ZZ`, which is automatically determined from the integer coefficients of the expressions.
4. The generator `cos(phi)` is either provided in the input `opt` or extracted from the expressions. Since the output explicitly lists it, we can include it in the input `opt` to ensure the function uses it.
5. The function `sympify` will convert string inputs to SymPy objects, so we can represent the expressions as strings for JSON compatibility.
6. The input `opt` can be a dictionary with at least `gens` set. Other options like `domain`, `polys`, and `expand` can be left unspecified (or set to default) because the function will compute them appropriately.
7. The function takes two positional arguments: `exprs` and `opt`. Following the example structure, we package them in `args` with an empty `kwargs`.

Thus, the input should be:
- `exprs`: `["2", "-2*cos(phi)"]`
- `opt`: `{"gens": ["cos(phi)"]}`

This input will be sympified to the expressions `2` and `-2*cos(phi)`, use the generator `cos(phi)`, construct the domain `ZZ` from the coefficients, and set `polys` to `false` because no Poly objects are present.
