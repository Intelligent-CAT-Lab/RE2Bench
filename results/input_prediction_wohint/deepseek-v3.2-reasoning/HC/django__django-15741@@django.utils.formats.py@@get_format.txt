Looking at the function `get_format`, I need to determine what input arguments would produce the output `"jS \\o\\f F"`.

[THOUGHT]
1. First, let's understand the output format. The string `"jS \\o\\f F"` looks like a date format string where:
   - `j` = day of the month without leading zeros (1-31)
   - `S` = English ordinal suffix for the day of the month (st, nd, rd, or th)
   - `\\o\\f` = literal "of" (with escaped backslashes in the JSON)
   - `F` = full month name

2. This is likely the `DATE_FORMAT` setting for English locale. In Django, this would be the format for the date.

3. The `get_format` function takes three parameters: `format_type`, `lang`, and `use_l10n`. Based on the output, I need to find which `format_type` would return this string.

4. Looking at the code, `get_format` first checks if `use_l10n` is None. If so, it tries to get `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL`, falling back to `settings.USE_L10N`. Then if `use_l10n` is True and `lang` is None, it uses `get_language()`.

5. The function then tries to get the format from format modules for the specified language. If not found, it falls back to settings.

6. The output `"jS \\o\\f F"` appears to be a localized date format. Given this is a typical English date format, the language is likely English.

7. The `format_type` would be something like `"DATE_FORMAT"` since that's what this format string represents.

8. Let me trace through possible execution paths:
   - If `use_l10n` is True (or defaulting to True), and language is English, the function would look in format modules for English and retrieve `DATE_FORMAT = "jS \\o\\f F"`
   - If `use_l10n` is False, it would get the format from `settings.DATE_FORMAT`, which might also be set to this value

9. Since the output is specifically this format string, and it's coming through the localization system, I'll assume `use_l10n=True` and `lang=None` (letting it use current language).

10. The format type must be `"DATE_FORMAT"` to return this particular string.

11. Looking at the `ISO_INPUT_FORMATS`, I see `DATE_FORMAT` is not in there, so the function would return the value directly without appending ISO formats.

12. Therefore, the most likely input is:
    - `format_type = "DATE_FORMAT"`
    - `lang = None` (or unspecified)
    - `use_l10n = None` (letting it use default from settings, which is typically True)

13. In the function call, if `lang` and `use_l10n` are not specified, they default to None, which is what we want.

14. So the input should be: `get_format("DATE_FORMAT")`
