[THOUGHT]
The output is "1/(a - b)". The function radsimp simplifies expressions by rationalizing denominators containing square roots. If the input expression already has a denominator without square roots, radsimp will likely return it unchanged, possibly after some minor simplifications like signsimp and gcd_terms. For the expression 1/(a - b), there are no square roots, so radsimp should return the same expression. Therefore, a plausible input is the expression itself. Other parameters (symbolic and max_terms) are kept at their defaults since not specified.
