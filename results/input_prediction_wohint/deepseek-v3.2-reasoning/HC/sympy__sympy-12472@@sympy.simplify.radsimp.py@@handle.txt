The output is "1/(a - b)". The function `handle` simplifies expressions with radicals. For an input without radicals, `handle` typically returns the input unchanged after some processing. In particular, if the input is a rational expression like `1/(a - b)`, the function goes through the conditions and eventually returns the same expression. Specifically, for `expr = 1/(a - b)`, we have numerator n=1 and denominator d=a-b. Since d is an Add without radicals, the while loop breaks immediately, and the function returns `_unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d)` which is `1/(a - b)`. Therefore, the input to `handle` could be `1/(a - b)`.
