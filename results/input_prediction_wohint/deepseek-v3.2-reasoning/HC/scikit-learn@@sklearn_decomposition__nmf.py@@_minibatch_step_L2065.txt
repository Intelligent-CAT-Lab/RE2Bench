[THOUGHT]
1. The output is the batch cost from `_minibatch_step`. To match the given output of 1.2975666761016735, I constructed a simple scenario with minimal dimensions and default parameters to simplify calculations.
2. I assumed default values: `beta_loss='frobenius'` (beta=2), `alpha_W=0.0`, `alpha_H='same'` (so 0.0), `l1_ratio=0.0`, `fresh_restarts=False`, `tol=0.0001`, and `_gamma=1`. Regularization terms become zero.
3. I chose dimensions: `batch_size=1`, `n_features=2`, `n_components=1`. So X is 1x2, W is 1x1, H is 1x2.
4. To ensure the multiplicative update of W does not change it (for simplicity), I set H such that the update leaves W unchanged. With H = [[1, 0]], the update computes numerator = X @ H.T = x1, denominator = W * (H @ H.T) = W * 1, so W_new = W * (x1 / W) = x1. To keep W unchanged, I set x1 = initial W = 1. So X[0,0] = 1.
5. The cost depends on the difference between X and W@H. After the update, W becomes 1 (unchanged), so W@H = [[1, 0]]. Then X - W@H = [[0, x2
