The output is a Bunch with a single key "trans", whose value is another Bunch with keys for each method in METHODS (fit, transform, etc.) and empty dictionaries as values. This indicates that `_get_empty_routing` iterated over exactly one transformer with name "trans". The method `_iter` is called with `fitted=False`, `column_as_labels=False`, `skip_drop=True`, and `skip_empty_columns=True`. To produce the given output, the ColumnTransformer instance must have:
- A single transformer in `self.transformers` with name "trans", a non-drop transformer (e.g., "passthrough"), and non-empty columns (e.g., [0]).
- `self._columns` must be a list with one element matching the transformer's columns (e.g., [[0]]) so that zipping yields the correct column selection.
- `self._remainder` should be such that `self._remainder[2]` is falsy (e.g., an empty list) to avoid chaining the remainder, or if it is truthy, the remainder transformer must be "drop" and will be skipped due to `skip_drop=True`. For simplicity, set `self._remainder = ["remainder", "drop", []]`.
- `self.transformer_weights` is None (default).
Other attributes can take default values as they do not affect the iteration under the given parameters.
