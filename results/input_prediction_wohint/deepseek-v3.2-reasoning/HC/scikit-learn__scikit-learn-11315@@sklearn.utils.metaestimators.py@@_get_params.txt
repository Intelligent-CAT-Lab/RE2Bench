[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a dictionary with keys "n_jobs", "remainder", "transformer_weights", and "transformers", all with specific values and no nested keys (e.g., no "__" keys). This suggests that the function `_get_params` likely returned early due to `deep=False`, because if `deep=True`, it would add nested parameters from estimators, which are not present in the output.

2. The function `_get_params` first calls `super().get_params(deep=deep)`. If `deep=False`, it returns this result immediately without processing estimators. The output matches what `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=False)` would return for an instance with attributes `n_jobs=1`, `remainder='passthrough'`, `transformer_weights=None`, and `transformers=None`.

3. For `super().get_params(deep=False)` to produce this output, the instance must have these attributes, and its class's `__init__` must include these parameters (as per `_get_param_names`). The absence of other keys like "sparse_threshold" indicates that, in this context, only these four parameters are relevant.

4. Since `deep=False`, the `attr` parameter is not used in the function (because the condition `if not deep: return out` is true). However, it must still be provided as input. Based on the helper functions referencing `_transformers` and the context of scikit-learn composition classes, `attr` is likely "transformers".

5. To avoid errors, `deep` must be `False`; if `deep=True`, and `estimators` (from `getattr(self, attr)`) is `None`, `out.update(estimators)` would raise a `TypeError`. With `deep=False`, this is avoided.

6. Therefore, the input should include:
   - `self`: An instance with attributes `n_jobs=1`, `remainder='passthrough'`, `transformer_weights=None`, `transformers=None`.
   - `args`: A list with `attr="transformers"` and `deep=False`.
   - `kwargs`: Empty, as no keyword arguments are needed.
