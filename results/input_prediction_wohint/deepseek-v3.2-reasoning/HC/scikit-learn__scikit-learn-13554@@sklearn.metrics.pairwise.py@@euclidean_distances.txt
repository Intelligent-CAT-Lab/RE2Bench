[THOUGHT]
1. The output is a 1x1 array with value 1.1649954, which is a Euclidean distance (or squared distance, but more likely distance because the default is squared=False).
2. To get a 1x1 output, X and Y must each have one row. So we consider X and Y as 1x1 arrays (one sample each, one feature).
3. The distance between two points in 1D is the absolute difference. So we set X=[[0.0]] and Y=[[1.1649954]] to get a distance of 1.1649954.
4. The function uses float32 if the input is float32. The output value has 8 digits, which is typical for float32. However, we cannot specify dtype in JSON. We assume that the input arrays are provided as float32 in the actual call, but in our JSON we represent them as lists. The function will convert them to arrays, and if they are float32, then the output will be float32. Alternatively, if they are float64, the output will be float64 and might be printed with 8 digits. We choose the simplest representation.
5. We set squared=False (default) and do not provide X_norm_squared and Y_norm_squared.
6. Thus, the input to the function is X=[[0.0]], Y=[[1.1649954]], with no additional keyword arguments.
