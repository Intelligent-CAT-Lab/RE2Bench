[THOUGHT]
The function `add` takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The given output is 1223, so we need `x` and `y` such that `x + y = 1223`. Since the function is straightforward and no additional constraints are provided, there are infinitely many possible pairs. We can choose any pair that satisfies the equation. For simplicity, we select `x = 0` and `y = 1223`. This pair will produce the output 1223 when passed to the function.
