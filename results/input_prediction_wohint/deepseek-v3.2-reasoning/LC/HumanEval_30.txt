[THOUGHT]
The function `get_positive(l)` returns a new list containing only the elements of `l` that are greater than 0. The given output is `[4, 5, 6]`. This means the input list `l` must have included the numbers 4, 5, and 6 in that order, and no other positive numbers (since they would appear in the output). The input could also contain non-positive numbers (e.g., 0, -1) without affecting the output, but these are not required to produce the given output. Since the problem asks to predict the input and the output is exactly the positive elements, the simplest and most direct input is the list `[4, 5, 6]` itself. Therefore, we choose this as the input value for `l`.
