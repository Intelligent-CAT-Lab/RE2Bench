[THOUGHT]
The output is a list containing a single element: 5. The function returns an empty list if the input array is empty, so the input must be non-empty. For a non-empty array, the function returns a sorted version of the array. Since the output has only one element, the input must also have exactly one element; otherwise, sorting would produce a list of the same length but possibly reordered. If the input had multiple elements, even if they are all identical, the output would have multiple elements, contradicting the given output. Therefore, the input must be a list with one element, and that element must be 5 to match the output. Thus, the input array is [5].
