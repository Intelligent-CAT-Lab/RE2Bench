[THOUGHT]
The function `make_a_pile(n)` generates a list of length `n` where each element is `n + 2*i` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The given output list is `[3, 5, 7]`, which has length 3. Therefore, `n` must be 3. Verification: For `n=3`, the list is `[3+2*0, 3+2*1, 3+2*2] = [3, 5, 7]`. So the input `n` is 3.
