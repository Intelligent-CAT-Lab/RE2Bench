The output is "-1/8", a rational number. We need to find inputs to `_polynomial_integrate` that produce this result. The function integrates a polynomial over a polygon using a facet-based method. We can construct a simple example: a constant polynomial over a triangle. Using a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and inward-pointing normals, the contribution from each facet yields a sum of -1 when the polynomial is 1. To get -1/8, we scale the polynomial to 1/4. Thus, with polynomials = {0: 1/4}, facets as the three edges of the triangle, and hp_params corresponding to the inward normals and offsets, the integral computes to -1/8. The input is represented in JSON with appropriate structures.
