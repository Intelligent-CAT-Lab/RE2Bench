[THOUGHT]
The function `double_the_difference(lst)` computes the sum of squares of elements in `lst` that satisfy three conditions: positive (`i > 0`), odd (`i % 2 != 0`), and no decimal point in string representation (`'.' not in str(i)`). The output is 0, meaning no elements met all conditions. The simplest case is an empty list, which trivially results in a sum of 0. Other lists without positive odd integers (e.g., containing only negative numbers, even numbers, or floats) would also work, but an empty list is the most straightforward.
