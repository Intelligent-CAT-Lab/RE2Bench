[THOUGHT]
1. The function `read_manifest` reads a manifest file named `self.manifest_name` (default: "staticfiles.json") from the storage's location and returns its content as a string.
2. The output is a JSON string containing a manifest with "paths" and "version". This string is the content of the manifest file.
3. To get this output, the manifest file must exist at the correct path and contain the given string.
4. The path is determined by `self.location` and `self.manifest_name`. `self.location` is derived from `self._location` (if set) or from `settings.MEDIA_ROOT`.
5. Therefore, we set `self._location` to a directory path (e.g., "/static") and `self.manifest_name` to "staticfiles.json". This ensures that the file path is `/static/staticfiles.json`.
6. We assume that the file at that path exists and contains the given JSON string.
7. No other arguments are passed to `read_manifest`, so `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
