[THOUGHT]
The `add_event` method appends the given event to the `self.events` list and returns `None`. The output provided is `null`, which corresponds to `None` in Python. This output is always the same regardless of the event argument, so the event cannot be determined uniquely from the output. However, we must provide a specific input. The simplest assumption is that the event is `None`, which is a valid value to append. The instance of `CalendarUtil` is initialized with `self.events = []`, so the `self` state includes an empty list. The method takes one positional argument `event`, so `args` should contain it under the key `"event"`. There are no keyword arguments.
