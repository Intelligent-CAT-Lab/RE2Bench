1. The function _jaccard computes Jaccard similarity between two sets A and B defined by Cartesian products of row and column selections. The output is 1.0 when the Jaccard similarity is 1, which happens when A = B (nonempty). That requires intersection = a_size = b_size.
2. Intersection = (a_rows * b_rows).sum() * (a_cols * b_cols).sum()
   a_size = a_rows.sum() * a_cols.sum()
   b_size = b_rows.sum() * b_cols.sum()
3. For equality to hold, we need (a_rows * b_rows).sum() = a_rows.sum() = b_rows.sum() and similarly for columns. This is satisfied if a_rows and b_rows are identical binary vectors, and a_cols and b_cols are identical binary vectors.
4. Choose the simplest binary vectors: all of length 1 with value 1. Then:
   a_rows = [1], a_cols = [1], b_rows = [1], b_cols = [1].
5. Verify: 
   intersection = (1*1).sum() * (1*1).sum() = 1 * 1 = 1.
   a_size = 1 * 1 = 1, b_size = 1 * 1 = 1.
   result = 1 / (1 + 1 - 1) = 1.0.
6. Represent input as JSON. Since the function is a plain function, we provide the arguments as a dictionary under "args", and an empty "kwargs". (Following the pattern of the example but without "self".)
