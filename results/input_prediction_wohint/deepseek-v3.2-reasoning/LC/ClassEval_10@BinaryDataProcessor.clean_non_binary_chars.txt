Let’s reason through this step by step.  

The code shows a class `BinaryDataProcessor` with:  

1. An `__init__` method that takes `binary_string`, stores it in `self.binary_string`, and immediately calls `self.clean_non_binary_chars()`.  
2. The `clean_non_binary_chars()` method filters `self.binary_string` to keep only `'0'` and `'1'` characters, then updates `self.binary_string` with that cleaned version.  

But the output given is:  
```json
{
    "output": null
}
```  

This means `clean_non_binary_chars` returns `None` (it’s a method that doesn’t return anything, just modifies `self.binary_string`). So we are told the **output** after calling `clean_non_binary_chars` is `null` — that’s exactly what we’d expect from the method: it returns nothing.  

But the question is:  

> What will be the input of `clean_non_binary_chars`  

`clean_non_binary_chars` is an instance method that takes only `self`. So its input is always just `self`.  

We have to determine what `self` contains:  
- `self` will have been initialized with some `binary_string` argument to `BinaryDataProcessor`.  
- The example format (from the given earlier template) for input includes `"self"` dictionary containing attributes.  

Thus, we need to choose some original `binary_string` that could lead to this output (null) after calling `clean_non_binary_chars`.  

But the output being `null` does not depend on the input string — it’s always `null`.  
So the original binary string could be anything — maybe `"101abc100"` — after cleaning, `self.binary_string` changes, but the method returns `None`.  

But the problem might be asking for the call’s input in the JSON format as in the example:  
```json
{
    "self": {
        "binary_string": "some value"
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```  

Since `clean_non_binary_chars` takes no args except `self`, `args` and `kwargs` are empty.  

So we just need to pick a plausible initial `binary_string` — maybe with non-binary chars to show cleaning is relevant.  

I’ll choose `"101abc100"` so that cleaning removes `"abc"`.  

[THOUGHT]
The `clean_non_binary_chars` method takes no arguments besides `self`.  
Its output is always `None`, so the given output `null` doesn’t constrain the input beyond that.  
Thus the input must include `self` with a `binary_string` attribute, which will be modified after the call.  
I'll pick an example `binary_string` that contains non-binary characters to make the call meaningful.
