[THOUGHT]
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` and returns a string of numbers from 0 to `n` separated by spaces. The given output is "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", which includes numbers from 0 to 10, so `n` must be 10. Following the input format from the example, where `args` is a dictionary with the parameter name as the key, the input should have `self` as an empty object, `args` with key "n" and value 10, and `kwargs` as an empty object.
