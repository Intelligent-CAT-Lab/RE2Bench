[THOUGHT]
1. The output string "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)" is produced by the `_print_Permutation` method of `StrPrinter`. This indicates that the permutation is printed in array form (non-cyclic) with a size of 6.
2. The array form shown is `[1, 0]`, but the full array form must be `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to have size 6 and swap elements 0 and 1 while leaving others fixed.
3. The permutation's support is `{0, 1}`, so the trimmed representation is used because it's shorter than the full array form.
4. The input to `sstr` must be a `Permutation` object with the above properties. This can be created by `Permutation([1, 0], size=6)` or equivalent.
5. The function `sstr` takes an expression and optional settings. No special settings are needed, so `kwargs` is empty.
6. Represent the permutation object as a JSON structure with its class and essential attributes (`_args`, `_array_form`, `_size`).
