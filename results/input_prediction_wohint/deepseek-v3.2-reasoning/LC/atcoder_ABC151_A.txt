[THOUGHT]
The code snippet reads an input string, takes its first character's Unicode code point, adds 1, and prints the corresponding character. Given the output is "b", which has Unicode code point 98, we need the input's first character to have code point 97, which is 'a'. The simplest input that satisfies this condition is the single character "a", as any additional characters would be ignored by `ord()`.
