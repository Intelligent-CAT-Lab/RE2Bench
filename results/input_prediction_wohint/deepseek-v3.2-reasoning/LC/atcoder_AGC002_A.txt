[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers a and b. It prints "Zero" if the interval [a, b] includes 0. It prints "Negative" if a < 0 and min(b-a, -a) is even. Otherwise, it prints "Positive". To get "Positive", we need to avoid both conditions. A simple way is to choose a > 0, because then a <= 0 is false (so no "Zero") and a < 0 is false (so no "Negative"). For example, with a=1 and b=1, the conditions fail and the code goes to the else branch, printing "Positive". There are many other possible inputs, but this is a minimal and valid one.
