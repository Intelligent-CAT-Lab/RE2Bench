[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers S and W from input, separated by whitespace. It prints "unsafe" if S is less than or equal to W, otherwise "safe". Given the output is "unsafe", the condition S <= W must hold. Therefore, any pair of integers with S <= W will produce the desired output. For simplicity, I choose S=10 and W=20, which satisfies 10 <= 20. The input string should be "10 20".
