[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes an array, creates a copy, reverses it, and returns a list of squares of the reversed elements. The output is `[1, 4, 1]`, which has three elements, so the input array must also have three elements. Let the input array be `[a, b, c]`. After reversing, we get `[c, b, a]`, and squaring gives `[c^2, b^2, a^2]`. Setting this equal to `[1, 4, 1]` yields `c^2 = 1`, `b^2 = 4`, `a^2 = 1`. Thus `a = ±1`, `b = ±2`, `c = ±1`. The simplest solution is `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`, giving the input array `[1, 2, 1]`. Other sign combinations are possible, but this is the most straightforward.
