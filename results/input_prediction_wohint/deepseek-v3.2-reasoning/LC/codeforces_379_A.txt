The code simulates a process where `a` initial items are consumed, and then additional items are obtained by exchanging `b` empty containers for a new full one. The total number of items consumed, `h`, is given by `a + floor((a-1)/(b-1))`. Given the output `h = 80`, many pairs `(a, b)` satisfy this equation. One such pair is `(72, 9)`, which yields `h = 72 + floor(71/8) = 72 + 8 = 80`. Verification confirms that with `a = 72` and `b = 9`, the code prints `80`.
