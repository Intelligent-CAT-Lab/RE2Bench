The function `add_book` does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`), so the output `null` (None in JSON) is always produced regardless of the input. Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine the input from the output. However, we must provide a valid input that would produce `None`. The input should include the object state (`self.inventory`) and function arguments (`title` and `quantity`). Since the function modifies `self.inventory`, but the output doesn't reflect the state, any valid call would work. Let's choose an example where we add a book to an initially empty inventory.

[THOUGHT]
The `add_book` method modifies the `inventory` dictionary but returns `None`. The output `null` corresponds to `None` in Python, which is always the return value of this method. Therefore, the input cannot be uniquely determined from the output alone. However, we need to provide a plausible input. The object's initial state is `inventory = {}`. We can choose any `title` and `quantity`. For simplicity, let's use `title = "Example Book"` and `quantity = 1`. This call will add the book to the empty inventory and return `None`.
