[THOUGHT]
The function f(num) takes a list num, appends its last element (num[-1]) to the list, and returns the modified list. Given the output list is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1], we can deduce the input list by removing the last element if it is a duplicate of the second last. Since output[-1] = 1 and output[-2] = 1, the input list's last element is 1, and the appended element is also 1. Thus the input list is the output list without the last element: [-70, 20, 9, 1]. Check: appending 1 to this list yields [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1], which matches the output.
