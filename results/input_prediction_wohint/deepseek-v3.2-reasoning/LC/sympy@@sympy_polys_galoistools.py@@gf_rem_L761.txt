1. The output remainder is [2,0], which in SymPy's polynomial representation (descending order) corresponds to the polynomial 2*x + 0, i.e., 2*x.
2. For gf_rem to return this, the divisor polynomial g must have degree > 1 because remainder degree must be less than divisor degree.
3. Choose a simple divisor g = [1,0,0] (i.e., x^2).
4. Choose a simple quotient q = [1] (constant 1).
5. Compute f = q*g + r = [1]*[1,0,0] + [2,0] = [1,0,0] + [0,2,0]? Actually, adding polynomials: q*g = x^2, remainder = 2*x. So f = x^2 + 2*x = [1,2,0] (descending).
6. Choose a prime modulus p > 2, e.g., p = 5.
7. Verify with the gf_div algorithm: leading coefficient of g is 1, invert(1,5)=1. The algorithm should compute remainder [2,0].
8. The domain K can be taken as ZZ (integer domain) as used in examples.
Thus, input: f = [1,2,0], g = [1,0,0], p = 5, K = ZZ.
