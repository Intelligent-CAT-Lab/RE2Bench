[THOUGHT]
The code snippet reads two integers A and B from input, computes `ans = A - 2 * B`, and if `ans` is negative, sets it to 0 before printing. The given output is 0, so `ans` must be 0 after the if statement. This occurs when `A - 2 * B <= 0`, i.e., `A <= 2 * B`. There are many possible integer pairs (A, B) that satisfy this condition. For simplicity, I choose A = 0 and B = 0, which gives `A - 2 * B = 0`, so `ans` remains 0 and is printed. Therefore, the input string should be "0 0".
