[THOUGHT]
The function `octal_to_decimal` takes an octal string `octal_num` and returns its decimal equivalent by using `int(octal_num, 8)`. The output is `21271`, which is an integer. To find the input, we need to determine the octal string that converts to `21271` in decimal. This involves converting `21271` from decimal to octal.

Conversion steps:
- Divide 21271 by 8: quotient 2658, remainder 7.
- Divide 2658 by 8: quotient 332, remainder 2.
- Divide 332 by 8: quotient 41, remainder 4.
- Divide 41 by 8: quotient 5, remainder 1.
- Divide 5 by 8: quotient 0, remainder 5.
Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives the octal digits: 5, 1, 4, 2, 7. Thus, the octal representation is "51427".

Verification: 
5×8⁴ + 1×8³ + 4×8² + 2×8¹ + 7×8⁰ = 5×4096 + 1×512 + 4×64 + 2×8 + 7 = 20480 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7 = 21271. Correct.

Therefore, the input `octal_num` is "51427".
