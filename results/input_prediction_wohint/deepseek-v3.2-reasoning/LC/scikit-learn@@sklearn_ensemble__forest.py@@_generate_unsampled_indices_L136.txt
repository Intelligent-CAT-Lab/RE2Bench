1. The function `_generate_unsampled_indices` generates unsampled indices from a bootstrap sample. Given the output unsampled indices array, we need to infer the inputs `random_state`, `n_samples`, and `n_samples_bootstrap`.
2. The output unsampled indices range from 2 to 149, with no index above 149. This suggests `n_samples` is at least 150 (since indices are 0 to n_samples-1). If `n_samples` were larger, unsampled indices beyond 149 would appear unless they are all sampled, which would require additional draws. The simplest assumption is `n_samples = 150`.
3. The unsampled indices count is 56, so the sampled distinct indices count is 150 - 56 = 94. In bootstrap sampling, `n_samples_bootstrap` is often set equal to `n_samples`. The expected number of unsampled indices when `n_samples_bootstrap = n_samples` is approximately `n_samples / e ≈ 55.1`, close to 56. Thus, `n_samples_bootstrap = 150` is plausible.
4. The exact set of unsampled indices depends on the random seed. Many random seeds could produce this set. A common default is `random_state = 0`. Without further information, this is a reasonable choice.
5. Therefore, the predicted inputs are `random_state = 0`, `n_samples = 150`, `n_samples_bootstrap = 150`.
