[THOUGHT]
1. The output is an empty pandas DataFrame (no columns, no rows) as indicated by empty `_mgr` and other attributes.
2. The function `PolyFit.__call__` drops rows with NaN in 'x' or 'y', then applies `self._fit_predict` via `groupby.apply`.
3. To get an empty DataFrame as result, there must be no groups to process. This happens if the cleaned data has no rows.
4. Thus, `data` must have no rows or all rows have NaN in 'x' or 'y'.
5. Choose `data` as a DataFrame with one row where both 'x' and 'y' are NaN.
6. `groupby` must be an object with an `apply` method. Since the cleaned data is empty, the grouping yields no groups regardless of grouping keys. Choose `groupby` as an object that groups by a column 'group'. Include a column 'group' in `data` to make the grouping valid.
7. `orient` and `scales` are not used in the shown code, so set them to default values: `orient='x'`, `scales=None`.
8. `self` is an instance of `PolyFit` with no special attributes, so represent as empty.
9. Represent `data` as a pandas DataFrame with internal structure having columns 'x', 'y', 'group' and one row of NaN for 'x' and 'y', and a dummy value for 'group'.
