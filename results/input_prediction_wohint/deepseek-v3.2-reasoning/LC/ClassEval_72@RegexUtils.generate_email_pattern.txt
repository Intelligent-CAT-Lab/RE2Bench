[THOUGHT]
The method `generate_email_pattern` takes only `self` as a parameter and returns a fixed regex pattern string. The output matches this pattern exactly. Since the method does not use any instance attributes or additional arguments, the input must be a call with an empty `self` (no instance attributes), no positional arguments (`args` empty), and no keyword arguments (`kwargs` empty). Therefore, the input is straightforward: `self` as an empty dictionary, `args` as an empty dictionary, and `kwargs` as an empty dictionary.
