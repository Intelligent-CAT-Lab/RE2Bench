[THOUGHT]
The output is "AbCdEfG", a string of 7 letters with alternating case. The Vigenère decryption algorithm subtracts a shift derived from the key from each alphabetic character in the ciphertext, preserving case. For the output to match this pattern, the ciphertext must have the same case pattern (uppercase at even indices, lowercase at odd indices). The simplest key that results in no change is "a" (shift 0), making the ciphertext identical to the plaintext. Thus, the input likely uses key="a" and ciphertext="AbCdEfG". This is consistent with the JSON input format required.
