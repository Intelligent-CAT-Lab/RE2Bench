The function `greatest_common_divisor` implements the Euclidean algorithm: while `b` is non-zero, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a % b` respectively, then returns `a`. The output is given as 5, so we need integers `a` and `b` such that their greatest common divisor is 5. There are infinitely many pairs; a simple choice is `a = 15` and `b = 10`, since `gcd(15, 10) = 5`. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
- Initial: `a = 15`, `b = 10` (b ≠ 0)
- First iteration: `a, b = 10, 15 % 10 = 5` → `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- Second iteration: `a, b = 5, 10 % 5 = 0` → `a = 5`, `b = 0`
- Loop ends because `b = 0`, returns `a = 5`.
Thus, the input `a = 15`, `b = 10` produces the desired output.
