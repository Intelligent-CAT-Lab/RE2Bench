The output skewness is 0, which occurs when the data is symmetric around the mean or when all values are identical. Considering the formula, a simple symmetric list like `[1, 2, 3]` results in a skewness of 0 because the sum of cubed deviations from the mean is zero. This input is valid and does not cause division by zero (unlike some edge cases with n=2).

[THOUGHT]
The skewness formula returns 0 when the standard deviation is 0 (all values equal) or when the sum of cubed deviations is 0 (symmetric distribution). A simple symmetric list is `[1, 2, 3]` with mean 2. The deviations are -1, 0, 1, and their cubes sum to 0. The denominator is non-zero for n=3, so skewness computes to 0. This is a valid and straightforward input that produces the given output.
