[THOUGHT]
The code reads three integers: k (cost of first banana), n (initial money), w (number of bananas). It calculates the total cost sum = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w) = k * w * (w + 1) / 2. If sum <= n, it prints 0, meaning no extra money is needed. Given the output is 0, the condition sum <= n must hold. To find a valid input, we can choose simple numbers that satisfy the inequality. For example, let k = 1, w = 1, then sum = 1. To satisfy sum <= n, set n = 1. Thus, input "1 1 1" produces output 0.
