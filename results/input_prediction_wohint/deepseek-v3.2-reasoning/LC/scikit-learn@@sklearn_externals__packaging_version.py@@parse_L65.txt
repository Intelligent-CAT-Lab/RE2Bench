[THOUGHT]
1. The output provided is a string representation of a `Version` object: `<Version('1.11.3')>`. This indicates that the `parse` function successfully created a `Version` object for a valid version string.
2. The `parse` function takes a single argument `version` (a string). It attempts to instantiate a `Version` object with that string. If the string is invalid according to the `Version` class regex, it raises an `InvalidVersion` exception and returns a `LegacyVersion` instead.
3. Since the output shows a `Version` object, the input string must be a valid version. The version displayed in the representation is '1.11.3', so the input string must have been '1.11.3'.
4. The `Version` class regex (implied from the `__init__` code) parses version strings into epoch, release, pre, post, dev, and local parts. '1.11.3' is a standard release triplet, which is valid.
5. Therefore, the input to `parse` is the string "1.11.3".
