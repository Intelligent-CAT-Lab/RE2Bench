[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d. It computes the length of the intersection of intervals [a, b] and [c, d] as max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)). The output is 0, so we must have min(b, d) - max(a, c) <= 0. There are many possible inputs that satisfy this. A simple example is when the intervals are disjoint: [1,2] and [3,4]. Then min(2,4)=2, max(1,3)=3, and 2-3=-1, so max(0,-1)=0. Therefore, the input could be "1 2 3 4".
