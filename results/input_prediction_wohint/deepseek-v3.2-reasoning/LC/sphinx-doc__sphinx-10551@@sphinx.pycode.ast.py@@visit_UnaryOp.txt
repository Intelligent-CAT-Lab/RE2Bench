[THOUGHT]
The output "~1" suggests the result of visiting an `ast.UnaryOp` node representing a bitwise invert operation on the integer 1. The method `visit_UnaryOp` checks if the operator is `ast.Not`; otherwise, it concatenates the string representations of the operator and operand without a space. For `~1`, the operator is `ast.Invert` and the operand is `ast.Num(1)`. Thus, the input node should be an `ast.UnaryOp` with `op` set to `ast.Invert()` and `operand` set to `ast.Num(1)`. The `self` parameter must have a `visit` method that returns "~" for `ast.Invert` and "1" for `ast.Num(1)`; since `self` is an instance of `_UnparseVisitor`, we assume the class provides these methods. We represent the node in JSON with type hints for reconstruction.
