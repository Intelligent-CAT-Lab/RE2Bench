[THOUGHT]
1. The function `dup_l1_norm` computes the L1 norm of a univariate polynomial `f` over a domain `K`, which is the sum of the absolute values of its coefficients using `K.abs` and `K.sum`.
2. The given output is 3, so we need the sum of absolute coefficients to equal 3.
3. Choose a simple polynomial whose absolute coefficients sum to 3: `f = [1, 1, 1]` (representing \(x^2 + x + 1\)).
4. Choose `K` to be the integer domain (like `ZZ`), which provides `abs` and `sum` methods. The domain must have `zero = 0`, and the class provides the necessary methods.
5. Following the example JSON format, set `self` to null (since `dup_l1_norm` is a standalone function), `args` as a dictionary with `f` and `K`, and `kwargs` empty.
