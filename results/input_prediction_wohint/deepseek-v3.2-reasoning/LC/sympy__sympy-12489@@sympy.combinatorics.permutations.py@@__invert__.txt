[THOUGHT]
The function `__invert__` is a method of the Permutation class that returns the inverse permutation. It uses `self._array_form` to compute the inverse via `_af_invert`, and then creates a new Permutation with `self._af_new`. The output provided shows `_array_form` as null and `_size` as 5 for the resulting permutation after inversion. 

To achieve this output, the input permutation `self` must have `_array_form` null because if `_array_form` were not null, `_af_invert` would likely return a non-null array form, contradicting the output. The `_size` of the output is 5, which should match the size of the input permutation, as inversion does not change the size. Therefore, the input `self` must have `_array_form` null and `_size` 5. When `__invert__` is called with such an input, `_af_invert(null)` returns null, and `_af_new(null)` creates a new Permutation with `_array_form` null and `_size` 5, consistent with the output.

Thus, the input to `__invert__` is a Permutation instance with `_array_form` null and `_size` 5.
