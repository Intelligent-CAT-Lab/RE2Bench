The code reads three integers: r, D, x. Then it performs 10 iterations, each time updating x = r * x - D and printing the new x. The output is a sequence of 10 numbers: 110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220. Let these be x1 to x10 (where x1 is the first printed value after the first iteration). We have the recurrence x_{n+1} = r * x_n - D. We can solve for r and D using two equations: from x1 and x2: 120 = r*110 - D, and from x2 and x3: 140 = r*120 - D. Subtracting gives 20 = 10r, so r=2. Plugging back: 120 = 2*110 - D => D=100. Verify with later terms: x4=2*140-100=180, x5=2*180-100=260, etc., all match. Then using x1 = r*x0 - D, we get 110 = 2*x0 - 100 => x0 = 105. So the initial input is "2 100 105".
