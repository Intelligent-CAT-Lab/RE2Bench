The function f(nums, pop1, pop2) removes two elements from the list `nums` by index: first at index `pop1 - 1`, then at index `pop2 - 1` from the modified list, and returns the resulting list. Given output is [1, 2, 3], a list of length 3, so the original list must have had length 5 (since two removals reduce length by 2). Thus, we need to find an original list of 5 elements and indices pop1, pop2 such that after the two removals, we get [1, 2, 3].

We consider a simple case: assume the original list consists of consecutive integers starting from 1, i.e., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. To obtain [1, 2, 3], we need to remove 4 and 5. There are two ways: remove 4 first then 5, or remove 5 first then 4. If we remove 4 first (index 3, so pop1 = 4), the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 5]. Then removing 5 (now at index 3) requires pop2 = 4. Alternatively, if we remove 5 first (index 4, pop1 = 5), the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4], and then removing 4 (index 3) requires pop2 = 4. Both are valid. However, a common pitfall in such functions is that using the same index value for both pops results in removing different elements due to list shifting, which is instructive. Therefore, we choose pop1 = 4 and pop2 = 4, leading to the following steps:
- First pop: nums.pop(3) removes 4 → nums becomes [1, 2, 3, 5].
- Second pop: nums.pop(3) removes 5 → nums becomes [1, 2, 3].
Thus, the input nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], pop1 = 4, pop2 = 4 produces the given output.
