The function `change_base` converts an integer `x` to a string representation in the given `base`. The output is `"4"`, meaning the returned string is a single digit '4'. This occurs when the number `x` is less than `base` and equals 4. The algorithm works as follows:
- Initialize `ret = ''`.
- While `x > 0`:
  - Compute `x % base`, giving the least significant digit.
  - Prepend that digit (as string) to `ret`.
  - Update `x = x // base`.
- Return `ret`.

For the output to be `"4"`, the loop must run exactly once, producing a single digit '4'. This implies:
- On the first iteration: `x > 0`, `x % base = 4`, and after `x //= base`, `x` becomes 0.
- Since `x // base = 0`, we have `x < base`, so `x % base = x`. Thus `x = 4`.
- Therefore, `x = 4` and `base > 4` (since `x < base`). Also, `base` must be an integer at least 2 to avoid infinite loops or other issues.
- `x` must be positive; if `x <= 0`, the loop does not run and returns an empty string.

One simple valid input is `x = 4` and `base = 10`. Other bases like 5, 6, ... also work, but base 10 is a common choice.
