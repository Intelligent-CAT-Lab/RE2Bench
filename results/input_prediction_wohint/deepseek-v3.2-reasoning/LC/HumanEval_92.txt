[THOUGHT]
The function `any_int(x, y, z)` returns `True` only if all three arguments are integers and any two of them sum to the third. The given output is `{"output": true}`, indicating that the function returned `True`. Therefore, the input values for `x`, `y`, and `z` must be integers that satisfy one of the sum conditions: `x + y == z`, `x + z == y`, or `y + z == x`.

Simulating the execution:
1. Check if `x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers. For the function to return `True`, this must be true.
2. Then check the sum conditions. At least one must hold.

A simple set of integers that satisfies this is `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`, because `1 + 2 = 3`, which matches `x + y == z`. All are integers, so the function returns `True`.

Thus, the input should have `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 3` as arguments to `any_int`.
