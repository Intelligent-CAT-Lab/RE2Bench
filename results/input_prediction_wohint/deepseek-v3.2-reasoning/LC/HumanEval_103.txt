The output is "0b101101110", which is the binary representation of the integer 366. So the function returns bin(366). That means round(summation / (m - n + 1)) = 366.
The summation is the sum of integers from n to m inclusive, which equals (n+m)*(m-n+1)/2. The average is summation/(m-n+1) = (n+m)/2.
So we require round((n+m)/2) = 366.
Using standard rounding rules (with half rounding to even), this implies 365.5 ≤ (n+m)/2 ≤ 366.5, i.e., 731 ≤ n+m ≤ 733.
Since n and m are integers and m ≥ n, there are many possible pairs. For example, (n=1, m=731) gives n+m=732, average=366 exactly, rounded to 366. (n=365, m=366) gives n+m=731, average=365.5, rounded to 366. (n=366, m=367) gives n+m=733, average=366.5, rounded to 366.
Any such pair is a valid input. I choose (n=1, m=731) as a simple example.
