[THOUGHT]
The output is an empty list. The function removes elements in three phases: first, while -1 in array, pop(-3); second, while 0 in array, pop(); third, while 1 in array, pop(0). For the output to be empty, all elements must be removed. This implies the input array must contain only -1, 0, and 1, because any other number would not be removed. Additionally, to avoid IndexError when popping index -3, whenever -1 is present, the array must have length at least 3. A minimal input that satisfies these conditions and contains each of -1, 0, and 1 is [-1, 0, 1]. Simulating: start with [-1,0,1]. Phase 1: -1 present, pop(-3) removes index 0 (-1), array becomes [0,1]. No more -1. Phase 2: 0 present, pop() removes last element (1), array becomes [0]. pop() removes 0, array becomes []. Phase 3: no 1, return []. Thus, input [-1,0,1] produces the given output.
