Looking at the Python function `__eq__` for the `IndirectReference` class, I need to determine what inputs would produce `false` as the output.

[THOUGHT]
1. The `__eq__` method compares two `IndirectReference` objects for equality based on three conditions:
   - They must be the same class (exact type match)
   - Their `object_id` attributes must be equal
   - Their `generation` attributes must be equal

2. The output is `{"output": false}`, meaning the equality check returned `False`.

3. For the equality to return `False`, at least one of the three conditions must fail.

4. There are several ways this could happen:
   - `other` could be a different class (or subclass) than `self`
   - `other.object_id` could differ from `self.object_id`
   - `other.generation` could differ from `self.generation`

5. I need to choose one specific failure case. Let me pick a simple one: same class but different `object_id` values.

6. For the input format, I need to provide:
   - `self`: the object on which the method is called
   - `args`: the positional arguments (just `other`)
   - `kwargs`: any keyword arguments (empty in this case)

7. I'll create:
   - `self` as an `IndirectReference` with `object_id=1` and `generation=0`
   - `other` as another `IndirectReference` with `object_id=2` and `generation=0`

8. This should cause the equality check to fail because `object_id` values differ.
