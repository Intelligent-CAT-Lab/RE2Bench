[THOUGHT]
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst`, computes the ceiling of each element, squares it, and sums these squares. Given the output is 1086, we need to find a list such that the sum of squares of the ceilings equals 1086.

One simple approach is to use integers, as their ceiling is themselves. We need to find integers whose squares sum to 1086. We can try to decompose 1086 into a sum of squares. For example, 32² = 1024, 6² = 36, 5² = 25, 1² = 1, and 1024 + 36 + 25 + 1 = 1086. Thus, the list [32, 6, 5, 1] works perfectly.

We could also use non-integer numbers (e.g., numbers in (0,1] to get a ceiling of 1) and have 1086 such numbers, but the four-number solution is simpler and more straightforward.

Therefore, the input list can be [32, 6, 5, 1].
