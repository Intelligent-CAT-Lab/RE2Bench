[THOUGHT]
The code reads three integers A, B, T from input, computes ans = T // A * B, and prints ans. Given that the output is 1, we have T // A * B = 1. Since all variables are integers, one simple solution is to set A = 1, B = 1, and T = 1. This yields T // A = 1 // 1 = 1, and ans = 1 * 1 = 1. The input string should be these three integers separated by spaces, so "1 1 1" is a valid input. Other combinations are possible, but this is the most straightforward.
