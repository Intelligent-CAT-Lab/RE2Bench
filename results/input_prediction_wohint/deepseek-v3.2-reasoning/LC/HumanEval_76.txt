[THOUGHT]
Given output true, the function returns True if either (n == 1 and x == 1) or (n != 1 and x is an exact power of n, i.e., x = n^k for some integer k >= 0). There are infinitely many such pairs. Without additional constraints, I choose a non-trivial example: x = 8, n = 2. Simulating: power starts at 1; while power < 8: power = 1 * 2 = 2; while power < 8: power = 2 * 2 = 4; while power < 8: power = 4 * 2 = 8; loop exits; power == 8 evaluates to True. Thus, input (x=8, n=2) produces the given output.
