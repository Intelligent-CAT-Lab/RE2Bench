[THOUGHT]
The code reads two strings `a` and `b` from input, splits them, reverses `b`, converts both to integers, and prints their sum. The output is 1165701527. To find an input that produces this output, we can set `b` such that its reversed integer is 0, which happens when `b` is "0". Then `a` must be the output itself. Thus, input "1165701527 0" works. This is the simplest solution and follows from reversing the operations: if `int(b[::-1]) = 0`, then `int(a)` must equal the output.
