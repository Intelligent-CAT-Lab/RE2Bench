[THOUGHT]
The method `FileInput.use_required_attribute` returns `super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial)`. For the output to be True, both parts must be True. The super method (from Widget) returns True by default in Django. Therefore, we need `not initial` to be True, meaning `initial` must be falsy. The simplest is `initial = None` or `initial = False`. We choose `initial = None`. The `self` object does not need any specific attributes because the method does not access any instance attributes and the super method always returns True. Thus, `self` can be an empty object.
