[THOUGHT]
The function `unique` takes a list `l`, converts it to a set (removing duplicates), then back to a list, and finally sorts it. The output is a sorted list of unique elements from the input. Given the output `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, the input list must contain exactly these numbers as its distinct elements, possibly with duplicates and in any order. The simplest input that produces this output is the output list itself, since it already contains unique elements and is sorted. Thus, the input list is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
