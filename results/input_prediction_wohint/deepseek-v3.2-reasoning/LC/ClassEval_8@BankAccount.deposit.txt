[THOUGHT]
The `deposit` method of `BankAccount` adds the given `amount` to the current balance and returns the new balance. The output is 300, meaning the balance after the deposit is 300. This gives the equation: initial_balance + amount = 300. The method also requires `amount >= 0` (otherwise it raises ValueError). The initial balance can be any number (positive, zero, or negative), but typically it's non-negative. Without additional constraints, there are infinitely many possible inputs. However, in the absence of other clues, the simplest and most common scenario is that the account starts with the default balance of 0 (as per `__init__`), and a deposit of 300 is made to reach 300. This is a straightforward and plausible input.
