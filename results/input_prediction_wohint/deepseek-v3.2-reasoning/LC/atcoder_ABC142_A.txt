The output is 0.5050505050505051, which is not 0.5, so N must be odd. The code for odd N prints (N+1)/(N*2). Set this equal to the output: (N+1)/(2N) = 0.5050505050505051. Recognize that 0.5050505050505051 is approximately 50/99. Solving (N+1)/(2N) = 50/99 gives 99(N+1) = 100N → 99N + 99 = 100N → N = 99. Verification: (99+1)/(99*2) = 100/198 = 50/99 ≈ 0.5050505050505051. Thus the input N is 99.
