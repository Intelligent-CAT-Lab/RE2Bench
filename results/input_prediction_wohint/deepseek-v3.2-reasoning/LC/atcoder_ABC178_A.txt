[THOUGHT]
The Python code reads an integer input `x`. If `x` equals 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1. The given output is 0, which means the condition `x == 1` must be true. Therefore, `x` must be 1. Since the input is read as a string and then converted to an integer, the input string should be "1". Thus, the input is "1".
