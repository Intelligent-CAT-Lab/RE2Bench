[THOUGHT]
The `_convert_to_variance` method in `VarianceUncertainty` simply returns `self`, so the output state matches the input state. The output shows `_unit` as a dimensionless unit with `_scale: 1.0` and `_bases` and `_powers` as null, which corresponds to an empty list representation in Python. The `_array` is a 2x5 numpy array of squares from 1 to 100, represented as a string in the output but can be provided as a list of lists for JSON compatibility. `_parent_nddata` is null (None). Therefore, the input instance should have the same state.
