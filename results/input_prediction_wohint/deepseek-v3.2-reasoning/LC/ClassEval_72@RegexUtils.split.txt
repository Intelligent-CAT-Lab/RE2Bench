[THOUGHT]
The output from the `split` function is a list: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]. This indicates that `re.split(pattern, text)` produced four parts, meaning there were three matches of the pattern in the text. The empty strings at the start and end imply that the pattern matches at the very beginning and very end of the text. The parts " abiguygusu " and " kjgufwycs " have surrounding spaces, suggesting that in the original text, these substrings are surrounded by spaces and delimiters that match the pattern. 

To achieve this output, a simple approach is to let the pattern be a single character like 'x' that does not appear in the substrings. Then, construct the text as: pattern + " abiguygusu " + pattern + " kjgufwycs " + pattern. This gives text = "x abiguygusu x kjgufwycs x". When split by 'x', the pattern matches at the start, between the substrings, and at the end. The splits yield:
- Before first 'x': empty string.
- Between first and second 'x': " abiguygusu " (including spaces).
- Between second and third 'x': " kjgufwycs " (including spaces).
- After third 'x': empty string.

This matches the given output exactly. The `RegexUtils` class has no instance attributes, so `self` can be an empty object. Thus, the input values are pattern = "x" and text = "x abiguygusu x kjgufwycs x".
