Let me analyze this `Hotel.check_in` method step by step:

1. First, the method checks if `room_type` exists in `self.booked_rooms.keys()`:
   - If NOT, it returns `False`
   
2. If room_type exists, it checks if `name` exists in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`:
   - If NOT, the method ends without returning anything → returns `None` (implicitly)
   
3. If name DOES exist:
   - If `room_number > self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`: returns `False`
   - If `room_number == self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`: removes the name from booking
   - If `room_number < self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`: reduces the booked count

Given that the output is `null` (which corresponds to Python's `None`), the method must have executed without hitting any `return False` statement.

Looking at the logic:
- The method can only return `None` in two cases:
  1. Room_type exists AND name doesn't exist in that room_type → implicit return
  2. Room_type exists, name exists, and room_number ≤ booked count (executes `pop()` or subtraction)

Since the output is `null`, I need to construct an input where either:
- The room_type exists in `booked_rooms` but the name doesn't exist for that room_type
OR
- The room_type exists, the name exists, and room_number ≤ the booked count

I'll choose the simpler first case for this prediction.

Let me create a sample Hotel object state:
- `name`: "Grand Hotel" (arbitrary)
- `available_rooms`: 100 (arbitrary)
- `booked_rooms`: {"double": {"Smith": 2}} (room_type "double" exists with "Smith" booked 2 rooms)

For the method call:
- `room_type`: "single" (different from "double")
- `room_number`: 1
- `name`: "Jones"

This satisfies:
1. "single" is NOT in `booked_rooms.keys()` → returns `False` ❌ (not null)

Wait, that would return `False`, not `None`. Let me reconsider.

Actually, for `null` output, the method must NOT return `False`. So either:
1. Room_type exists AND name doesn't exist (implicit return)
OR  
2. Room_type exists, name exists, and room_number ≤ booked count

Let me try: room_type "double" exists, name "Smith" exists, room_number 2 equals booked count (2):
- This triggers `pop()` → implicit return → `null` ✅

Perfect! This matches the output of `null`.

So the input should be:
- Hotel object with `booked_rooms` containing room_type "double" with "Smith" booked 2 rooms
- `check_in("double", 2, "Smith")`

Now I'll construct the JSON input structure following the example format.
