[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of input, splits it into two integers h and a, then computes math.ceil(h / a) and prints the result. Given that the output is 6, we have math.ceil(h / a) = 6. This means h / a is greater than 5 and at most 6. Since h and a are positive integers, we have the inequality 5a < h <= 6a. There are many integer pairs (h, a) satisfying this. One simple solution is a = 1, then h must satisfy 5 < h <= 6, so h = 6. Thus the input could be "6 1". Other solutions exist, but this is the smallest.
