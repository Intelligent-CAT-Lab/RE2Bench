[THOUGHT]
The output `{"_array_form": null, "_size": 7}` likely represents the Permutation object returned by `__pow__`. This state suggests that the resulting permutation has size 7 and its array form is not stored (null). In sympy, the identity permutation is sometimes represented with a null array form to optimize memory. Therefore, the simplest scenario is that the result is the identity permutation of size 7. The identity results from raising any permutation of size 7 to the power 0. Additionally, the presence of `sympy.core.numbers.Integer.__int__` in the called functions indicates that `n` was a sympy Integer object. Thus, `n` should be 0 (as a sympy Integer). The input `self` can be any permutation of size 7; for concreteness, we choose a non-identity permutation with `_array_form` null and `_size` 7, as this aligns with the output being the identity with null array form. The call to `self.array_form` during execution may compute and set `self._array_form`, but that does not affect the result.
