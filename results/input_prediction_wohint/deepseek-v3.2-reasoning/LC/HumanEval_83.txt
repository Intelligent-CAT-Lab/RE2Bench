Let's trace through the function logic step by step.

We're given the function:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)
```

And the output is 18000.

Let's solve for n:

1. If n were 1, the output would be 1, but we have 18000, so n ≠ 1.

2. So the output follows the second path: 18 * 10^(n-2) = 18000.

3. Divide both sides by 18: 10^(n-2) = 18000 / 18 = 1000.

4. 1000 = 10^3, so 10^(n-2) = 10^3.

5. Therefore, n - 2 = 3, so n = 5.

Let's test: if n = 5, then 18 * 10^(5-2) = 18 * 10^3 = 18 * 1000 = 18000. ✓

Thus, the input is n = 5.

[THOUGHT]
The function has two cases: if n=1, returns 1; otherwise returns 18 * 10^(n-2). Given output 18000, we solve 18 * 10^(n-2) = 18000. Divide both sides by 18: 10^(n-2) = 1000. 1000 = 10^3, so n-2 = 3 → n = 5. Verify: 18 * 10^(5-2) = 18 * 1000 = 18000. So input n is 5.
