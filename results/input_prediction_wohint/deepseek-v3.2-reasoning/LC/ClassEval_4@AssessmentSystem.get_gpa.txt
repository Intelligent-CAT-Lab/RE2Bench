The `get_gpa` method returns the average of course grades for a given student, or `None` if the student doesn't exist or has no courses. The output is `75.0`, indicating that the student exists and has courses with an average of `75.0`. To produce this output, we need a student name and a `self.students` dictionary containing that student with course grades that average to `75.0`. A simple choice is a student named "Alice" with one course grade of `75.0`. This satisfies the conditions and yields the output. We'll construct the input JSON accordingly.
