1. The function `_cmp_name` compares two types `x` and `y` based on their names and a predefined list `ordering_of_classes`. The output is 1, meaning the comparison result is 1.
2. For the output to be 1, several conditions must be met:
   - `x.__name__ != y.__name__` (otherwise return 0).
   - `y` must be a subclass of `Basic` (otherwise return -1).
   - The comparison of indices (`i1` and `i2`) or names must yield 1.
3. The comparison logic:
   - If both names are in `ordering_of_classes`, return 1 if `i1 > i2`.
   - If both are not in `ordering_of_classes`, return 1 if `n1 > n2` lexicographically.
   - If only `n1` is not in `ordering_of_classes` (so `i1 = UNKNOWN`) and `n2` is in `ordering_of_classes`, then `i1 > i2` gives 1.
4. Without knowing `ordering_of_classes`, we assume a plausible ordering from sympy, such as `['Add', 'Mul']`.
5. Choose `x = Mul` (name 'Mul') and `y = Add` (name 'Add'):
   - `n1 = 'Mul'`, `n2 = 'Add'` → not equal.
   - `y` (Add) is a subclass of `Basic`.
   - With `ordering_of_classes = ['Add', 'Mul']`, `i1 = 1` (for 'Mul'), `i2 = 0` (for 'Add'), so `i1 > i2` gives 1.
6. Thus, the input that produces output 1 is `x = Mul` and `y = Add`. We represent these types by their fully qualified names in JSON.
