1. The output is `{"output": null}`, which likely indicates that the function raised an exception, resulting in a null output in the test framework.
2. The function `morsel_to_cookie` can raise a TypeError when `morsel['max-age']` is present and not convertible to an integer.
3. To trigger that, we need a morsel with a non-integer string for 'max-age'. Also, all other accessed keys must be present to avoid KeyError.
4. We construct a morsel with: key (for morsel.key), value, max-age="abc", expires="", comment="", domain="example.com", path="/", httponly=false, secure=false, version=0.
5. This morsel will cause the code to attempt `int("abc")`, raise ValueError, which is caught and re-raised as TypeError.
6. Thus, the function raises TypeError, leading to the null output.
