[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify` takes two string arguments `x` and `n`, each representing a fraction. It computes the product of these fractions and returns `True` if the product is an integer, otherwise `False`. Given the output is `true`, we need to find `x` and `n` such that `(a/b) * (c/d)` is an integer, where `x = a/b` and `n = c/d`. This condition is equivalent to `(a*c) % (b*d) == 0`. A simple way to satisfy this is to choose `x` and `n` as reciprocals, e.g., `x = "1/2"` and `n = "2/1"`. Then the product is `(1*2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1`, which is an integer. Alternatively, any pair where one fraction is the multiplicative inverse of the other, or both are integers, would work. We'll choose the simplest example that yields `true`.
