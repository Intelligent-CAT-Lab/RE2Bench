[THOUGHT]
The function `ComplexCalculator.multiply` takes two complex numbers and returns their product. Given the output is `(-5+10j)`, we need to find `c1` and `c2` such that:
- Real part: `c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag = -5`
- Imaginary part: `c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real = 10`.

A simple solution with small integers is `c1 = 1+2j` and `c2 = 3+4j`. Verification:
- Real: `1*3 - 2*4 = 3 - 8 = -5`
- Imaginary: `1*4 + 2*3 = 4 + 6 = 10`.

Since `multiply` is a static method, `self` is not used; we represent it as an empty object. Complex numbers are represented as JSON objects with `real` and `imag` keys to match the attribute access in the function.
