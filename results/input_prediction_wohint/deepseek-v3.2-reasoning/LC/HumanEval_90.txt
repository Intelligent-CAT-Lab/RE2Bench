[THOUGHT]
The function `next_smallest` takes a list, removes duplicates by converting to a set, sorts the unique values, and returns the element at index 1 (the second smallest) if there are at least two unique elements; otherwise returns `None`. Given the output is `2`, the sorted unique list must have at least two elements, with the first element being less than `2` and the second element exactly `2`. This can be achieved by many input lists, such as `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 2, 1]`, etc. The simplest input is `[1, 2]`. Therefore, we predict the input list to be `[1, 2]`.
