The output SQL is "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;". This indicates:
- The table name is "table1", so the SQLGenerator instance must have been initialized with table_name="table1".
- The SELECT clause uses "*", which is the default when the `fields` argument is None (or explicitly set to None).
- The WHERE clause includes the condition "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20", so the `condition` argument must be that string.
Thus, the method call is `select(fields=None, condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20")` on an instance with `table_name="table1"`. Following the example format, the input JSON should specify the instance attributes under "self" and the method arguments under "args".
