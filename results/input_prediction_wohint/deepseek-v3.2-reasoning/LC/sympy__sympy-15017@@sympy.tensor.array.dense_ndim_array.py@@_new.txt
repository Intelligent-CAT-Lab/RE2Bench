[THOUGHT]
We need to predict the input to `ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new` given an output JSON with keys `_shape`, `_array`, `_rank`, and `_loop_size`. The output indicates `_rank=2` and `_loop_size="4"` (interpreted as integer 4). The `_shape` is an empty object `{}` and `_array` is `null`, which may be placeholders or not relevant for the test. 

From the `_new` method, we know:
- `_rank = len(shape)`, so `shape` must be a tuple of length 2.
- `_loop_size = product(shape)`, so the product of the shape elements must be 4.
Thus, possible shapes include `(2,2)`, `(1,4)`, `(4,1)`. The `iterable` must have 4 elements to fill the array.

We assume the simplest case: `shape=(2,2)` and `iterable=[1,2,3,4]` (a flat list of 4 elements). This yields:
- `_shape = (2,2)` (though output shows `{}`, we ignore as placeholder).
- `_array = [1,2,3,4]` (though output shows `null`).
- `_rank = 2`.
- `_loop_size = 4`.

Thus, the input to `_new` is `iterable=[1,2,3,4]` and `shape=(2,2)`, with no keyword arguments. Since `_new` is a class method, the first argument `cls` is the class itself, which we represent as a string for simplicity.
