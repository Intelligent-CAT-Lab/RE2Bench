The output is "1 0". This means min(x) = 1 and the second printed number is 0. The second number is printed as abs(a-b)//2 if abs(a-b) >= 2, otherwise 0. Since 0 is printed, we must have abs(a-b) < 2, i.e., |a-b| is 0 or 1. Also, min(x)=1 implies that the smallest number in the list is 1, so all numbers are at least 1. Given that, the simplest input that satisfies these conditions is "1 1", where a=1, b=1, min=1, and |1-1|=0, so the second output is 0. Other possibilities like "1 2" also work, but "1 1" is the most straightforward. Therefore, the input is "1 1".
