[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs `arr` and `k` such that `maximum(arr, k)` returns `[-4, 4]`. The function sorts `arr` and returns the last `k` elements. Since the output has length 2, `k` must be 2. The last two elements of the sorted array must be `-4` and `4`. The simplest case is `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`. Sorting `[-4, 4]` gives `[-4, 4]`, and `arr[-2:]` is exactly `[-4, 4]`. Other arrays are possible, but this is a valid and minimal input.
