[THOUGHT]
The method `extract_all` returns `False` when an exception occurs during the extraction process. This can happen if the zip file specified by `self.file_name` does not exist, is not a valid zip file, or if there are issues with the output path (e.g., permission errors). For simplicity, we assume a common case where the zip file does not exist. Using a non-existent file name like "invalid.zip" and an arbitrary output path like "./output" will cause the method to raise an exception and return `False`.
