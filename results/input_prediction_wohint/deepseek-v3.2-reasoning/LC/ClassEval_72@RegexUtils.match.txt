[THOUGHT]
The `match` method uses `re.match(pattern, text)` which attempts to match the pattern at the beginning of the text. It returns `True` if there is a match, otherwise `False`. The given output is `false`, indicating no match was found. Therefore, we need to choose a pattern and text such that the pattern does not match at the start of the text. A simple example is pattern `"abc"` and text `"def"`, as `re.match("abc", "def")` returns `None` (no match). This will cause the method to return `False`. Since the `RegexUtils` class has no instance attributes, `self` can be an empty object.
