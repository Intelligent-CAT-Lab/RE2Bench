[THOUGHT]
The function f takes an array and maps each element num to a string of 'n' repeated num times, resulting in a list just_ns. Then it iterates over just_ns and appends each string to final_output, returning it. The output given is an empty list. That means final_output is empty, which implies just_ns is empty. just_ns is empty only if the input array is empty, because map over an empty array yields an empty iterator. If array contained any numbers (including zero or negatives), just_ns would contain strings (empty strings for zero or negative), and final_output would be a list of the same length as array, not empty. Therefore, the input array must be an empty list.
