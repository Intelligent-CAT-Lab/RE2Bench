The function `compare` takes two sequences `game` and `guess` and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements. Given the output `[2, 0, 0, 1]`, we know that `game` and `guess` must be sequences of length 4. Let game = [a, b, c, d] and guess = [e, f, g, h]. Then we have:
abs(a - e) = 2
abs(b - f) = 0
abs(c - g) = 0
abs(d - h) = 1
From abs(b - f) = 0, we get b = f; similarly c = g. For the first and last equations, there are many possible pairs. Since no additional constraints are given, we can choose a simple pair. A common simple case is to set `guess` to be all zeros, which gives `game` equal to the output values. Thus, game = [2, 0, 0, 1] and guess = [0, 0, 0, 0]. Alternatively, we could swap them, but the function's parameter order suggests `game` is the actual values and `guess` is the prediction. So using game as the actual scores and guess as all zeros is plausible. Therefore, the input is game = [2, 0, 0, 1] and guess = [0, 0, 0, 0].
