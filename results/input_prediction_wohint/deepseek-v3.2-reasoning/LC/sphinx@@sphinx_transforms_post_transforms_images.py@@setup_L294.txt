[THOUGHT]
1. The function `setup` takes one argument: `app`, which is an instance of `Sphinx`.
2. The function body registers two post transforms (`ImageDownloader` and `DataURIExtractor`) on `app` by calling `app.add_post_transform` for each.
3. The function then returns a fixed dictionary: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.
4. The output provided is exactly this dictionary, so the input `app` can be any valid `Sphinx` object that has an `add_post_transform` method.
5. Since the output does not depend on any specific state or attributes of `app`, we only need to represent `app` as a placeholder `Sphinx` instance in the input.
6. Following the example's structure for a standalone function (not a method), we represent the input as `args` (list of positional arguments) and `kwargs` (keyword arguments). Here, `app` is the only positional argument.
7. We represent `app` as an object with a `__class__` field indicating its type, which is sufficient for the function to execute successfully.
