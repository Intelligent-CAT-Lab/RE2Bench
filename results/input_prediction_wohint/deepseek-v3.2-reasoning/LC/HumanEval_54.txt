[THOUGHT]
The function `same_chars(s0: str, s1: str)` compares the sets of characters from both strings and returns `True` if they are equal. Given that the output is `true`, we need to provide two strings `s0` and `s1` such that `set(s0) == set(s1)`. Many pairs satisfy this condition, such as permutations of the same characters (e.g., "abc" and "cba"), identical strings, or strings with different frequencies but the same unique characters (e.g., "aab" and "ab"). For simplicity, we choose `s0 = "abc"` and `s1 = "cba"`, which are permutations and thus have identical character sets.
