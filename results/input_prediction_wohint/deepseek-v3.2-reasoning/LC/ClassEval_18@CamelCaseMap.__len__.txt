[THOUGHT]
The __len__ method of CamelCaseMap returns len(self._data). The output is 0, so len(self._data) = 0, meaning self._data is an empty dictionary. The __init__ method initializes self._data = {}, so the instance is likely newly created with no modifications. The input to __len__ is just the instance itself, with no other arguments. Therefore, the self object should have _data = {}, and args and kwargs are empty.
