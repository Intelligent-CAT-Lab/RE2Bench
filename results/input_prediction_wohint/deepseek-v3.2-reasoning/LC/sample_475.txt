[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes an array and an index. If the index is negative, it adjusts by adding the length of the array, then returns `array[index]`. The output is 1, so the element at the computed index must be 1. We can choose a simple array containing 1, such as `[1]`, and an index that points to that element. The simplest choice is index 0, which directly accesses the first element. This yields output 1. Thus, the input arguments are `array = [1]` and `index = 0`.
