[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers a, b, c, d from input, then computes the maximum of the four products a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d, and prints that maximum. Given the output is 56183721947132200, we need to find integers a, b, c, d such that max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d) = 56183721947132200. There are infinitely many possible inputs. However, we can construct a simple input by setting a*c equal to the output and making the other products smaller. For example, let a = 200, c = 280918609735661, since 200 * 280918609735661 = 56183721947132200. Then choose b and d to be 1, so that a*d = 200, b*c = 280918609735661, and b*d = 1, all of which are less than the output. Thus the input "200 1 280918609735661 1" would produce the given output. Other choices are possible, but this is a valid one.
