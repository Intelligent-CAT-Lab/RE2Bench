The code reads four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 from input, computes a = x2 - x1 and b = y2 - y1, then prints four values: x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a. Given the output "101 99 101 100", I denote:
p = x2 - b = 101
q = y2 + a = 99
r = x1 - b = 101
s = y1 + a = 100
With a = x2 - x1 and b = y2 - y1. Substitute into equations:
1. x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101 → x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
2. y2 + (x2 - x1) = 99 → y2 + x2 - x1 = 99
3. x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101 → x1 - y2 + y1 = 101
4. y1 + (x2 - x1) = 100 → y1 + x2 - x1 = 100
Subtract equation 3 from equation 1: (x2 - y2 + y1) - (x1 - y2 + y1) = 101 - 101 → x2 - x1 = 0 → x2 = x1. Let x = x1 = x2. Then a = x2 - x1 = 0.
From equation 2: y2 + x - x = y2 = 99 → y2 = 99.
From equation 4: y1 + x - x = y1 = 100 → y1 = 100.
Substitute into equation 1: x - 99 + 100 = 101 → x + 1 = 101 → x = 100.
Thus, x1 = 100, y1 = 100, x2 = 100, y2 = 99. Verify: a = 0, b = 99 - 100 = -1; compute: x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101, y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99, x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101, y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100, matching output. The input must be these four integers as a space-separated string.
