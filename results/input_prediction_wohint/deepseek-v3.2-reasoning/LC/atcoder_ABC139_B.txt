[THOUGHT]
The output is 2, which comes from the expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`. Simplifying gives `(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`. This integer division implies that `(t - 1) <= (h - 2) < 2*(t - 1)`, so `h >= t + 1` and `h < 2t`. Also, `t > 1` to avoid division by zero. The simplest integer solution is `t = 2` and `h = 3`, which satisfies the condition: `(3 - 2) // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`. Thus, the likely input is "2 3".
