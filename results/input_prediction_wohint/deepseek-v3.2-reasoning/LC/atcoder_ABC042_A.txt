[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each part to an integer, storing them in a tuple `ABC`. It then checks if the count of the value `5` in `ABC` is exactly 2. If true, it checks if the sum of all elements in `ABC` is 17. If the sum is 17, it prints `"YES"`; otherwise, it prints `"NO"`. If the count of `5` is not 2, it directly prints `"NO"`.

Given the output is `"YES"`, both conditions must be satisfied: `ABC.count(5) == 2` and `sum(ABC) == 17`. The simplest input that satisfies these conditions is three numbers: two `5`s and one `7`, because `5 + 5 + 7 = 17`. Thus, the input string `"5 5 7"` will produce the output `"YES"`. Other inputs are possible (e.g., more numbers with two `5`s and others summing to 7), but this is a minimal and straightforward solution.
