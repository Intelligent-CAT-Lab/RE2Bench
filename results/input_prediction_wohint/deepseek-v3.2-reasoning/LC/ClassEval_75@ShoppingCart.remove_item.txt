[THOUGHT]
The method `remove_item` returns `None` regardless of input because there is no explicit return statement. The output given is `null`, which corresponds to `None` in Python. Therefore, any valid input will produce this output. We need to provide a specific input that is consistent with the method's signature and the class state. We choose a simple scenario: an empty shopping cart (`items` dictionary empty) and call `remove_item` with an item name that is not in the cart, e.g., "apple". This will cause the `else` branch to execute (pass) and the method returns `None`. Alternatively, if the item were in the cart, the method would subtract the quantity but still return `None`. Without additional constraints, we select the empty cart case.
