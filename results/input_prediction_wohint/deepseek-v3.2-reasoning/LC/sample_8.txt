[THOUGHT]
Given the output is "UppEr", which has mixed case, and the function returns either the original string (if encryption == 0) or the uppercase version of the string encoded with rot13 (if encryption != 0). In the else branch, the string is first converted to uppercase, so it becomes all uppercase. Then applying rot13 to an all-uppercase string yields an all-uppercase string. Therefore, the output from the else branch would be all uppercase. Since the given output "UppEr" has lowercase letters, it must have come from the encryption == 0 branch. Thus, encryption must be 0 and the string must be exactly "UppEr".
