[THOUGHT]
The function `largest_divisor(n)` iterates `i` from `n-1` down to `0` (via `reversed(range(n))`) and returns the first `i` such that `n % i == 0`. Given the output is `1`, this means the largest divisor of `n` less than `n` is `1`. This occurs if and only if no integer in `[2, n-1]` divides `n`, which is the definition of `n` being a prime number greater than `1`. For `n=1`, the loop is empty and the function returns `None`. For `n <= 0`, the loop is also empty, returning `None`. Therefore, `n` must be a prime number > 1. The smallest such prime is `2`, which yields the output `1`. Other primes like `3`, `5`, etc., also work, but `2` is the simplest choice.
