[THOUGHT]
The code reads a string, sorts its characters, and checks if the first two are equal, the next two are equal, and the first pair is different from the second pair. For the output to be "Yes", these conditions must be true. The simplest input that satisfies this is a four-character string with two identical characters followed by two identical characters of a different type. "aabb" is one such string: when sorted, it becomes ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b'], meeting all conditions. Other permutations like "abab" also work, but "aabb" is straightforward.
