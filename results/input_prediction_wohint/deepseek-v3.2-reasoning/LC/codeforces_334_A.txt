[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer n, sets i=1 and j=n*n, then prints pairs (i, j) while i < j, incrementing i and decrement j each iteration. The output shows pairs from (1,64) to (32,33). This implies j starts at 64, so n*n = 64, hence n=8. The loop prints until i and j cross, which happens after 32 iterations. Thus the input is 8.
