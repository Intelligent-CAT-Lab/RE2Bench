[THOUGHT]
The function `__format_line_feed` is a static method that replaces sequences of one or more newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline. The provided output is `"Some sentence here."` with no newline characters. For the output to have no newlines, the input must contain no newline sequences because any newline sequence (even a single `\n`) would result in a newline in the output. Therefore, the input must be a string with zero newline characters. The simplest input that produces this output is the exact same string, `"Some sentence here."`. The method does not depend on instance attributes, so `self` can be an empty object. The argument `text` should be set to the input string.
