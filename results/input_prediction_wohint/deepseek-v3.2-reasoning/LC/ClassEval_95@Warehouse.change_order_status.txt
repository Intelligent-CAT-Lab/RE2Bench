[THOUGHT]
The function `change_order_status` returns `None` when it successfully updates an existing order's status (since Python functions return `None` by default when no explicit return is given). The output is `null`, which corresponds to Python's `None`. This means:

1. The condition `if order_id in self.orders` must have been `True`
2. The order existed in `self.orders`
3. The status was updated, and the function implicitly returned `None`

So the input must include:
- A `Warehouse` instance where `self.orders` contains the specified `order_id`
- An `order_id` that exists in `self.orders`
- A `status` value to update to

The structure of an order in `self.orders` isn't specified in the code, but since we access `self.orders[order_id]['status']`, each order must be a dictionary with a 'status' key.

I'll create a simple example with one existing order and call the method to update its status.
