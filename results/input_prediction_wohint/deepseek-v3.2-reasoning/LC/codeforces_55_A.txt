[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer n, then repeatedly divides n by 2 as long as it is even. After that, if n equals 1, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO". This essentially checks whether the input number is a power of 2. The output given is "NO", meaning the input number is not a power of 2. Therefore, we need any integer that is not a power of 2. The simplest such integer is 3. For n=3, it is odd, so the while loop does not execute; n != 1, so it prints "NO". Thus, one possible input is 3. Other numbers like 5, 6, 7, etc., would also work.
