[THOUGHT]
The function TR111 transforms powers of tan, sin, and cos into corresponding cofunctions with negative exponents if the base is positive or the exponent is a negative integer. The output "cos(phi)**2" is a power with base cos(phi) and exponent 2. Since cos(phi) is not guaranteed positive and the exponent is positive, the transformation condition fails, leaving the expression unchanged. Therefore, the input must be identical to the output: cos(phi)**2.
