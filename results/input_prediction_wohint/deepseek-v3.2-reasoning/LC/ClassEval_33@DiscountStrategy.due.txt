The due() method calculates the amount due after applying a discount. It uses self.__total (computed from the cart) and subtracts a discount determined by self.promotion. Given the output is 139.5, we need self.__total - discount = 139.5. The simplest case is discount = 0 (promotion = None), so self.__total must be 139.5. self.__total is set in __init__ by calling self.total(), which likely sums the prices in the cart. We can choose a cart that sums to 139.5, such as [100, 39.5], and any customer (e.g., "John"). This yields due() = 139.5.
