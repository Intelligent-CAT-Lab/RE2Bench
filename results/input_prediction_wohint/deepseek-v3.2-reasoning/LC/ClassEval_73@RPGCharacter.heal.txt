[THOUGHT]
The `heal` method increases the character's HP by 10, then caps it at 100. The output is 100, meaning after healing, HP is 100. Therefore, before healing, HP must have been at least 90 (since 90 + 10 = 100). If HP was greater than or equal to 90, adding 10 would result in at least 100, which gets capped to 100. For simplicity, I choose an initial HP of 90. The other attributes (`name`, `attack_power`, `defense`, `level`, `exp`) do not affect the healing process, so I set them to arbitrary default values: `name` to "Player", `attack_power` to 10, `defense` to 5, `level` to 1, and `exp` to 0. The `heal` method takes no arguments besides `self`, so `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
