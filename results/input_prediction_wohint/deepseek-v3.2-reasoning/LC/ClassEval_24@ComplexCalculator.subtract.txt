Let's reason through this step by step.  

The `ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2)` method returns `c1 - c2` as a Python `complex` number.  

We have:  
**Output:** `(2-2j)`  
That means `real = 2` and `imag = -2`.  

So:  
```
c1 - c2 = complex(2, -2)
```

We need to find possible `c1` and `c2` that satisfy `c1.real - c2.real = 2` and `c1.imag - c2.imag = -2`.  

The simplest choice is to pick `c1` with real part `a`, imaginary part `b`, and `c2` with real part `a - 2` and imaginary part `b + 2`.  

Let’s try picking `c1 = 3+1j` (real=3, imag=1), then:  
`c2` real = `3 - 2 = 1`,  
`c2` imag = `1 - (-2) = 3`.  

So `c2 = 1+3j`.  
Check:  
`(3 + 1j) - (1 + 3j) = (3-1) + (1-3)j = 2 - 2j ✅`.  

Any integer examples are fine, as long as they satisfy those two equations.  

Thus:  

[THOUGHT]
We are given output (2-2j). The method subtract(c1, c2) computes (c1.real - c2.real) + (c1.imag - c2.imag)*1j = 2 - 2j.  
So:  
c1.real - c2.real = 2,  
c1.imag - c2.imag = -2.  
Choosing c1.real = 3, c1.imag = 1 → c2.real = 1, c2.imag = 3 works.  
Thus c1 = 3+1j, c2 = 1+3j.
