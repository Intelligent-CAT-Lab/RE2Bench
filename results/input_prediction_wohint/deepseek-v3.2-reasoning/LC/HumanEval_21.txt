The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of numbers and returns a list where each number is scaled to the range [0,1] based on the min and max. Given the output [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], we can deduce that the input list had 5 numbers. Let the input list be [a, b, c, d, e]. After rescaling, we have:
- (a - min)/(max - min) = 0.0 => a = min
- (b - min)/(max - min) = 0.25
- (c - min)/(max - min) = 0.5
- (d - min)/(max - min) = 0.75
- (e - min)/(max - min) = 1.0 => e = max

Thus, the numbers b, c, d are evenly spaced between min and max. So the input list is an arithmetic progression with common difference (max - min)/4. There are infinitely many such lists. The simplest one with integer values is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] where min=0, max=4, and (max-min)=4, yielding the desired output. Another simple one is the output list itself [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], which would be unchanged by the function. However, since the function is meant to rescale to the unit interval, it is more typical that the input is not already in [0,1]. Therefore, I choose the input as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
