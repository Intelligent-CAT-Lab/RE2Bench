[THOUGHT]
The method `write_csv` returns 1 if the CSV file is written successfully, and 0 if an exception occurs. The output is 1, so the write was successful. Therefore, we need to provide a `data` argument that is a valid iterable of iterables for `csv.writerows` and a `file_name` that can be opened for writing in the current directory. A simple example is `data = [["Hello", "World"], ["Foo", "Bar"]]` and `file_name = "output.csv"`. With these inputs, the function will open "output.csv", write the rows, close the file, and return 1.
