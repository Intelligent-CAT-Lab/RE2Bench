[THOUGHT]
1. The method `vector_part` returns a new Quaternion with scalar part 0 and the same vector part (b, c, d) as the original.
2. The output is a string representation: "0 + x*i + y*j + z*k". This corresponds to a Quaternion with a=0, b=x, c=y, d=z.
3. Therefore, the original quaternion must have b=x, c=y, d=z. The scalar part a can be any commutative expression, but since it does not affect the output, we choose the simplest: a=0.
4. Thus, the original quaternion is Quaternion(0, x, y, z). We assume real_field and norm are defaults (True and None).
5. The input to `vector_part` is the self quaternion instance and no other arguments. So we represent self with its args and attributes.
