To predict the input for `_fit`, we interpret the output `RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1)`. This output string represents the state of the `RFE` object after `_fit` returns `self`.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Analyze `self` state**:
    *   The `repr` string shows `n_features_to_select=4` and `step=0.1`. These correspond to the attributes set in `__init__`.
    *   The `estimator` is `SVC(kernel='linear')`. This means `self.estimator` was initialized with an `SVC` instance with a linear kernel.
    *   `verbose` and `importance_getter` are not present in the output, implying they have default values (`0` and `'auto'`).
    *   The `estimator` object logic requires `clone(self.estimator)` to work. In the input JSON, we represent the estimator as a dictionary of its parameters. `kernel='linear'` is required; `C=1.0` is a standard default often explicit or implicit.

2.  **Analyze `args` (`X`, `y`)**:
    *   `step=0.1` suggests a fractional step size. The loop logic `step = int(max(1, self.step * n_features))` calculates the number of features to remove per iteration.
    *   `n_features_to_select=4` implies the target number of features.
    *   For the RFE loop to be active (and interesting), the input `X` should typically have more than 4 features. A minimal valid dataset would have 5 features (removing 1 feature reduces count to 4).
    *   We construct a small synthetic dataset for `X` (e.g., shape `(4, 5)`) and `y` (shape `(4,)`) that satisfies `ensure_min_features=2` and allows `SVC` to fit (requires samples for classes).

3.  **Construct Input JSON**:
    *   `self`: Dictionary containing `estimator` (as a dict of params), `n_features_to_select=4`, `step=0.1`, `verbose=0`, `importance_getter='auto'`.
    *   `args`: Dictionary containing `X` (2D list) and `y` (1D list).
    *   `kwargs`: Empty, as `fit_params` are empty.
