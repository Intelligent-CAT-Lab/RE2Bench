To predict the input for `FeatureUnion.fit_transform`, we analyze the provided output and the class behavior.

[THOUGHT]
The output is a 2D numpy array with shape (2, 4):
```
[[1., 1., 1., 0.],
 [1., 1., 0., 1.]]
```
The `FeatureUnion` class concatenates the results of multiple transformers applied to the input `X`. The method `fit_transform` calls `_parallel_func` to get results from transformers and then `_hstack` to merge them.
We need to determine `X` and the `transformer_list` configuration that produces this output.

The simplest configuration for `FeatureUnion` is a single transformer that passes the data through unchanged (identity). If `transformer_list` contains one entry `('trans', 'passthrough')` (which converts to `FunctionTransformer(feature_names_out='one-to-one')` inside `_iter`), the output of the union will be exactly the input `X`.

If we assume this simplest case:
1. `X` is exactly the output array: `[[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]]`.
2. `transformer_list` is `[["trans", "passthrough"]]`.
3. Other parameters (`n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`, `verbose`) are at their default values (`None`, `None`, `False`). `verbose_feature_names_out` defaults to `True`.

This setup is consistent with the `fit_transform` logic:
- `_iter` yields one transformer (passthrough).
- `_parallel_func` executes it, returning `X`.
- `_hstack` receives `[X]` and returns `X`.
- The result matches the provided output.

No complex decomposition of features (like splitting columns) is strictly required to explain the output, and `passthrough` is a standard string shortcut supported by the class. Thus, we predict `X` equals the output and the transformer is `passthrough`. We assign the standard variable name `feature_union` for the self wrapper.
