To predict the input for the `BlockMatrix.__new__` function, we must understand how it processes its arguments and what structure corresponds to the provided output.

1.  **Analyze the Function Logic**:
    *   The `__new__` method takes `*args`. It expects `len(args) == 1`.
    *   `args[0]` is assigned to `rows`.
    *   The code iterates through `rows` to verify it forms a valid block matrix. It checks:
        *   `rows` is a sequence (list) of sequences (rows of blocks).
        *   Each element `i` inside the sub-sequences must have `.rows` and `.cols` attributes (implying they are SymPy `Matrix` objects).
        *   The dimensions must align (row heights match across a row of blocks, column widths match down a column of blocks).
    *   Finally, `ImmutableDenseMatrix(rows, evaluate=False)` is called. This creates the matrix-of-matrices structure seen in the output.

2.  **Analyze the Output**:
    *   The output is a string representation: `Matrix([[Matrix(...), Matrix(...)], [Matrix(...), Matrix(...)]])`.
    *   This structure corresponds to a 2x2 grid of matrices.
    *   **Top-Left**: `Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])` (3 rows, 2 cols).
    *   **Top-Right**: `Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])` (3 rows, 3 cols).
    *   **Bottom-Left**: `Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])` (2 rows, 2 cols).
    *   **Bottom-Right**: `Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])` (2 rows, 3 cols).

3.  **Construct the Input**:
    *   The function call `BlockMatrix(arg)` passes `arg` as the first element of the `args` tuple.
    *   Therefore, `args[0]` is a list representing the 2x2 grid: `[[TL, TR], [BL, BR]]`.
    *   Since the elements must be `Matrix` objects (to satisfy `.rows`/`.cols` checks), and we are formulating JSON input, we will represent these objects using their string constructors which clearly define their value.
