[THOUGHT]
The function `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx)` is responsible for mapping a category index marked for dropping to its corresponding index in the encoded feature space, handling cases where infrequent categories might be merged.

1.  **Analyze the code logic**:
    The first check in the function is:
    ```python
    if not self._infrequent_enabled:
        return drop_idx
    ```
    If `_infrequent_enabled` is `False`, the method acts as an identity function for `drop_idx`.

2.  **Analyze the output**:
    The provided output is `0`.

3.  **Deduce Inputs**:
    *   **State (`self`)**: The simplest state that produces this result is when `self._infrequent_enabled` is `False`. This is the default behavior of `OneHotEncoder` when `min_frequency` and `max_categories` are not set.
    *   **Arguments (`drop_idx`)**: Under the condition where `_infrequent_enabled` is `False`, the function returns `drop_idx`. Since the output is `0`, the input `drop_idx` must be `0`.
    *   **Arguments (`feature_idx`)**: This argument is used to look up mappings if infrequent categories are enabled. Since we assume they are disabled, this argument is not used in the logic. However, this method is typically called within `enumerate` loops in `_set_drop_idx`, starting with index 0. Thus, `0` is the most probable value for `feature_idx`.

4.  **Conclusion**:
    Setting `self._infrequent_enabled` to `False`, `feature_idx` to `0`, and `drop_idx` to `0` will result in the output `0`.
