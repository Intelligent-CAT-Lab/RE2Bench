To predict the input for `_parallel_poly_from_expr`, we analyze the function logic and the provided output.

**Analysis of the Output:**
The output is a tuple containing:
1.  A list of `Poly` objects: `[Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ'), Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')]`.
    *   This indicates the function processed two expressions.
    *   The first expression is equivalent to `2`.
    *   The second expression is equivalent to `-2 * cos(phi)`.
    *   The inferred or specified domain is Integers (`ZZ`).
    *   The inferred or specified generator is `cos(phi)`.
2.  An options object `opt`:
    *   `gens`: `['cos(phi)']`
    *   `domain`: `'ZZ'`
    *   `polys`: `False`

**Execution Trace & Reasoning:**
1.  **Arguments `exprs`**:
    *   The output `polys` order corresponds to the input `exprs`.
    *   The first `Poly` represents the constant `2`.
    *   The second `Poly` represents `-2 * cos(phi)`.
    *   Since the output contains `opt` with `polys: False`, the input expressions were **not** `Poly` objects initially. If they were, `_polys` would be non-empty, and `opt.polys` would likely be `True` (or the optimization path would have been taken if both were Polys). Therefore, the inputs were standard SymPy expressions (or strings/numbers convertible to them).

2.  **Argument `opt`**:
    *   `opt.polys`: The code executes `if opt.polys is None: opt.polys = bool(_polys)`. The output is `False`. Since the inputs were not Polys (`_polys` list is empty), `bool(_polys)` is `False`. This result is consistent with the input `opt.polys` being `None`.
    *   `opt.gens`: The output shows `gens=['cos(phi)']`. This is exactly what the function `_parallel_dict_from_expr` would infer from the expressions `2` and `-2*cos(phi)`. If `gens` had been provided in the input, they would appear here. Since inference yields the same result, and it's the minimal assumption, input `gens` was `None`.
    *   `opt.domain`: The output shows `domain='ZZ'`. The code calculates `domain` using `construct_domain` if `opt.domain` is `None`. The coefficients are `2` and `-2`, which belong to the Integer Ring (`ZZ`). Thus, `ZZ` is the natural inferred domain. The input `domain` was likely `None`.
    *   The `expand` option is accessed (`if opt.expand:`), defaulting to `True` in SymPy options, though it's not explicitly in the output snippet.

**Conclusion:**
The input `exprs` was a list of expressions `[2, -2*cos(phi)]`.
The input `opt` was an options object (approximated here as a dict) initialized with `None` for the key parameters to allow auto-inference.
