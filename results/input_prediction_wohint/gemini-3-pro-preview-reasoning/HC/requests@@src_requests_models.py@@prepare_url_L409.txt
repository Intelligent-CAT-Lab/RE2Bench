The execution of the `prepare_url` function modifies the state of the `PreparedRequest` object (`self.url`) and returns `None`. The provided output `{"output": null}` confirms the function returned successfully (i.e., didn't raise an exception).

Based on the "Functions called during the execution" list:
1.  **`to_native_string` is listed**: In `prepare_url`, this function is called only if `params` is a string or bytes (`if isinstance(params, (str, bytes)):`). If `params` were a dictionary (the standard usage), `to_native_string` would not be called. Its presence implies `params` was a string or bytes.
2.  **`to_key_val_list` is NOT listed**: `_encode_params` calls `to_key_val_list` if the input is iterable (like a dict) but not a string/bytes. Since `to_key_val_list` is not in the list of called functions, we can infer `params` was not processed as a dict/list of tuples. This aligns with `params` being a string (where `_encode_params` returns it immediately).
3.  **`unicode_is_ascii` is listed**: This is called to check the `host` part of the URL. This implies a valid URL with a host was provided.
4.  **`requote_uri` is listed**: This is called at the end of the procedure.

Therefore, the input must resolve to a valid execution path where `url` is a valid string and `params` is a string.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze Return Value**: The return is `null`, so the function ran successfully.
2.  **Analyze `params`**: The trace lists `to_native_string` (used for str/bytes params) but not `to_key_val_list` (used for dict params). Thus, `params` must be a string, e.g., `"k=v"`.
3.  **Analyze `url`**: The trace lists `unicode_is_ascii`, checking the host. So `url` must contain a host. e.g., `"http://google.com"`.
4.  **Construct State**: `self` is a fresh `PreparedRequest`. `hooks` defaults to `{'response': []}`. Other attributes are `None`.
