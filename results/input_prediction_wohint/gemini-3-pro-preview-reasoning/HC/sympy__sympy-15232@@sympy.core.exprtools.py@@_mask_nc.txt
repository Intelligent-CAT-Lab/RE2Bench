To find the input `eq`, we analyze the execution of `_mask_nc` and the provided output.

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `["sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1", {}, null]`.
    *   This corresponds to the return value of `_mask_nc(eq)`.
    *   The return format is `(expr, subst_dict, nc_syms)`.
    *   The second element is `{}` (empty dictionary).
    *   The third element is `null` (which corresponds to an empty list `[]` or `None` in JSON, likely `[]` here).

2.  **Determine Execution Path**:
    *   `_mask_nc` checks `if expr.is_commutative:`.
        *   If `True`, it returns `(eq, {}, [])`.
        *   If `False`, it performs substitutions and returns `(new_expr, subst_dict_or_None, nc_list)`.
    *   Since the second element in the output is `{}` (not `null`/`None`), it strongly suggests the function took the first path: `expr.is_commutative` was `True`.
    *   This means the input `eq` was returned unchanged as the first element.

3.  **Reconstruct the Input Expression `eq`**:
    *   The string representation of `eq` is given as `"sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1"`.
    *   This unescapes to the string: `sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))") + 1`.
    *   We need to construct a SymPy expression that prints exactly this way.
    *   Standard `Sum` objects (e.g., `Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))`) print as `Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))` (without quotes).
    *   To get quotes around the `"Sum..."` part in the output of `str()`, the object inside `sin` must have quotes in its name or representation.
    *   A `Symbol` created with quotes in its name, e.g., `Symbol('"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))"')`, will print as `"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))"`.
    *   Expression: `sin(Symbol('"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))"')) + 1`.
    *   Let's verify commutativity: `sin` applied to a `Symbol` is commutative. Adding `1` preserves commutativity. So `is_commutative` is `True`.
    *   This matches all observations.

4.  **Format the Input**:
    *   The input JSON should define the arguments for `_mask_nc`.
    *   Based on the example, arguments are provided in an `"args"` dictionary.
    *   Key: `"eq"`.
    *   Value: The string constructing the expression, `"sin(Symbol('\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))\"')) + 1"`.
