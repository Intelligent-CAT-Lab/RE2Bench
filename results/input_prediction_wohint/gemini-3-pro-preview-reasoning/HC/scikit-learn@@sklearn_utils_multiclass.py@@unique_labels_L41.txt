The output `array([0, 1])` implies the function returned a numpy array containing the integers 0 and 1. This means the union of unique values across all input arguments `ys` is `{0, 1}`.

The trace lists `scikit-learn.sklearn.utils.multiclass.<genexpr>` as a function called during execution.
Looking at the code for `unique_labels`:
```python
    if label_type == 'multilabel-indicator' and len(set((check_array(y, accept_sparse=['csr', 'csc', 'coo']).shape[1] for y in ys))) > 1:
```
This generator expression `(check_array(y, ...).shape[1] for y in ys)` is the second operand of the `and` operator. In Python, the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand (`label_type == 'multilabel-indicator'`) is true.
Since the generator expression appears in the trace of called functions, it must have been executed (iterated or at least created). Thus, `label_type` must be `'multilabel-indicator'`.

A label type of `'multilabel-indicator'` corresponds to inputs that are 2D arrays (or sparse matrices) with binary values (typically used for multilabel classification) like `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` or even a single sample `[[0, 1]]`.
Simple 1D iterables like `[0, 1]` would be classified as `'binary'` or `'multiclass'`, which would result in the condition being false and the generator expression not being evaluated (and thus likely absent from a runtime function trace).

Therefore, the input must be a sequence of one or more 2D binary structures containing the values 0 and 1.
The simplest such input is a single list containing one sample with both labels: `[[0, 1]]`.
When `unique_labels` is called with this input:
1. `type_of_target([[0, 1]])` returns `'multilabel-indicator'`.
2. The code enters the `if` block, evaluating the generator expression (matching the trace).
3. The unique values are extracted, resulting in `0` and `1`.
4. The result `array([0, 1])` is returned.

The input arguments are passed as a list in `args`. Since `unique_labels` accepts `*ys`, we pass our input as the first (and only) element of `args`.
