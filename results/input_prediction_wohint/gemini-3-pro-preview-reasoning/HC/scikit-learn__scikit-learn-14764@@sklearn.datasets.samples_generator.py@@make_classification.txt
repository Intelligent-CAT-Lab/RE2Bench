To predict the input for `make_classification`, we analyze the characteristics of the output `(X, y)`:

1.  **Dimensions**:
    *   `y` has 50 elements, so `n_samples=50`.
    *   `X` has 50 rows and 2 columns, so `n_features=2`.

2.  **Class Structure (`y`)**:
    *   The `y` array contains only zeros: `[0, 0, ...]`.
    *   This implies only one class was generated. The argument `n_classes=1` produces this result.
    *   For `n_classes=1`, we typically set `n_clusters_per_class=1` to form a single distribution (blob). The constraints logic `n_informative >= log2(n_classes * n_clusters_per_class)` holds ($2 \ge \log_2(1)$).

3.  **Feature Structure (`X`)**:
    *   The features are 2-dimensional.
    *   With `n_features=2`, `n_informative` must be $\le 2$. The most standard configuration that produces pattern/covariance in all dimensions without redundant duplications is `n_informative=2` and `n_redundant=0`.
    *   The values in `X` are clustered but have very large offsets:
        *   Column 0 is centered around approx **328435**.
        *   Column 1 is centered around approx **-255363**.
    *   The variance (spread) of the data is small (range of ~2 to 4 units), typical of unit variance distributions. This suggests `scale` is likely default (1.0) and the large values come from the `shift` parameter.
    *   Typical `make_classification` output is centered at 0. To get these specific centroids, the `shift` parameter must be provided explicitly. The values `[328435, -255363]` are the integer approximations of the column means.

4.  **Random State**:
    *   The specific arrangement of points (noise) depends on `random_state`. While predicting the exact seed from the output values without a brute-force search is difficult, `42` is a standard convention for examples.
    *   Combining the derived arguments: `n_samples=50`, `n_features=2`, `n_informative=2`, `n_redundant=0`, `n_classes=1`, `n_clusters_per_class=1`, `shift=[328435, -255363]`.
