For the given function `restify`, specifically looking at the block:
```python
    try:
        if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
            return ':py:obj:`None`'
```
We can see that if the input `cls` is `None`, the function immediately returns `':py:obj:`None`'`. This matches the provided output exactly. While passing the string `":py:obj:`None`"` would also return the string itself (due to `elif isinstance(cls, str): return cls`), the function `restify` is intended to convert types/classes (or None) to their string representation. Thus, the most distinct and primary input for this output is `None`. In JSON format, `None` is represented as `null`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `restify(cls)` converts a Python class or type into a string representation.
The output provided is `":py:obj:`None`"`.
Looking at the beginning of the function:
1. `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:` -> returns `':py:obj:`None`'`.
2. Use Python's `None` as input to satisfy `cls is None`.
3. In JSON, Python's `None` translates to `null`.
Therefore, the input variable `cls` must be `None`.
