For the function `_compute_oob_predictions`, I need to predict the input arguments `X`, `y` and the state of `self`.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is a string representation of a numpy array. The array has the shape `(n_samples, n_classes, n_outputs)`.
    *   Looking at the output structure `[[[p0], [p1]], ...]`, there are 2 probabilities per sample, so `n_classes=2`.
    *   There is 1 inner list per sample, so `n_outputs=1`.
    *   By counting the number of sample blocks in both the full context (approximated) and the provided text, there appear to be exactly **134 samples**.
    *   The probabilities sum to 1.0 (e.g., `0.93333333 + 0.06666667 = 1.0`), confirming it's a classification probability output.

2.  **Estimate `self` attributes**:
    *   **Dataset Size**: A sample size of 134 is characteristic of the **Wine dataset** (178 samples) split into training/test sets with a standard split. Specifically, if `test_size=0.25` (approx 44-45 samples), the training set size is $178 - 44 = 134$. Since `_compute_oob_predictions` is typically run on the training data (`X`) during fitting, `X` corresponds to the training portion of the Wine dataset (or a similar dataset with 134 samples). The output shows 2 classes, implying the target `y` was binarized (e.g., class 0 vs 1, or one-vs-rest) or the dataset is a binary subset.
    *   **`n_estimators`**: The OOB (Out-Of-Bag) prediction is the average of predictions from trees where the sample was not used in bootstrapping. The denominators of the fractions representing probabilities (implied by the values) give a clue to the number of OOB trees.
        *   `0.93333333` $\approx 14/15$ (15 trees).
        *   `0.16666667` $\approx 1/6$ (6 trees).
        *   `0.82352941` $\approx 14/17$ (17 trees).
        *   `0.9047619` $\approx 19/21$ (21 trees).
        *   The number of OOB trees per sample varies between roughly 6 and 21. For a standard bootstrap, ~36.8% of samples are OOB. If the mean OOB count is around 13-15 (center of 6-21), then $0.368 \times n\_estimators \approx 14.5$, which suggests `n_estimators` is roughly **40**. If it were 100 (default), the counts would be around 37, which is not observed.
    *   **Other attributes**: `bootstrap` must be `True` and `oob_score` must be `True`. `max_samples` is likely `None` (default). `n_classes_` is `[2]`.

3.  **Construct Inputs**:
    *   `self`: A `BaseForest` (likely `RandomForestClassifier`) instance with `n_estimators=40`.
    *   `X`: An array representing the features. Given the deduction, it's an array of shape `(134, 13)` (Wine dataset has 13 features).
    *   `y`: An array representing the target labels, shape `(134,)`.
