To determine the input for `add_repr`, we analyze the function and the provided output.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Function (`add_repr`):**
    The function `add_repr(self, ns)` generates a `__repr__` script using `_make_repr_script`, appends it to `self._script_snippets`, sets `self._repr_added` to `True`, and returns `self` (the builder instance).
    
2.  **Analyze the Output:**
    The output is `{"output": "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"}`. This is the string representation of the *returned* `_ClassBuilder` object.
    Although `_ClassBuilder`'s `__repr__` method is not explicitly shown in the provided snippet, the output format `<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>` strongly implies that such a method exists and accesses `self._cls.__name__`. Therefore, `self._cls` must be a class (or mock object) with `__name__` equal to `"Concrete"`.

3.  **Deduce `self` State (Input):**
    *   `_cls`: Needs to be an object with `__name__="Concrete"` and `__qualname__="Concrete"` (used in `_make_repr_script`).
    *   `_script_snippets`: Since `add_repr` appends to this list, the input state (before execution) should be an empty list `[]`.
    *   `_repr_added`: The method sets this to `True`, so the input state is `False`.
    *   `_attrs`: Passed to `_make_repr_script`. Since the specific attributes aren't mentioned in the output, an empty list `[]` is the simplest valid assumption.
    *   `_add_method_dunders`: This attribute is accessed inside the closure created by `add_repr`. It must exist on `self` (set in `__init__`), though its specific value isn't critical for the execution flow itself. `null` or a placeholder is sufficient.

4.  **Deduce Arguments (`args`):**
    *   `ns`: The argument passed to `add_repr`. `ns` is used in `_make_repr_script` to optionally prefix the class name. The output (the builder object) does not expose the generated script content, so `ns` cannot be strictly determined from output alone. However, in `attrs` usage, `ns` typically defaults to `None`. We will assume `None`.

5.  **Construct Input JSON:**
    We build the JSON with the deduced state for `self` and arguments.
