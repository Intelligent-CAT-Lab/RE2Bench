To predict the input for `_get_params`, we analyze the code and the provided output.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is a dictionary containing `{'n_jobs': 1, 'remainder': 'passthrough', 'transformer_weights': null, 'transformers': null}`. These keys and values are characteristic of a `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` initialized with defaults and `transformers=None`.
2.  **Analyze `_get_params` logic**:
    *   The function first calls `out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`. Since `_BaseComposition` inherits from `BaseEstimator`, this call inspects the `__init__` method of `self`'s class and retrieves the corresponding attributes.
    *   The values in the output correspond exactly to what `BaseEstimator.get_params` would return (shallowly) if `self` has those attributes set as shown (specifically `transformers` being `None`).
    *   The function then checks `if not deep: return out`.
    *   If `deep` were `True`, the function executes `estimators = getattr(self, attr)` followed by `out.update(estimators)`.
3.  **Determine parameters**:
    *   **`self`**: Must be an instance (likely `ColumnTransformer`) with attributes `n_jobs=1`, `remainder='passthrough'`, `transformer_weights=None`, and `transformers=None` to match the output values.
    *   **`attr`**: This positional argument specifies the attribute name holding the estimators. For a `ColumnTransformer`, this is `'transformers'`.
    *   **`deep`**: The output shows `"transformers": null`. This implies `self.transformers` is `None`.
        *   If `deep` were `True`: The code would execute `estimators = getattr(self, 'transformers')`, which would be `None`. Then `out.update(None)` would raise a `TypeError` because `None` is not iterable used for updating a dictionary.
        *   Since the function executed successfully and produced the output, the code path must have returned early.
        *   Therefore, `deep` must be `False`.

**Conclusion**:
The input `self` corresponds to a `ColumnTransformer` with `transformers=None`. The arguments passed are `'transformers'` for `attr` and `False` for `deep`.

[THOUGHT]
1. Output matches attributes of a `ColumnTransformer`. `transformers` is `null`, meaning `self.transformers` is `None`.
2. Code path: `_get_params` calls `super().get_params`.
3. If `deep=True`, `out.update(getattr(self, attr))` is executed. If `attr` is "transformers" (standard for this class), `getattr` returns `None`. `out.update(None)` crashes.
4. Thus, `deep` must be `False` to return `out` immediately without error.
5. Input `attr` is likely "transformers".
