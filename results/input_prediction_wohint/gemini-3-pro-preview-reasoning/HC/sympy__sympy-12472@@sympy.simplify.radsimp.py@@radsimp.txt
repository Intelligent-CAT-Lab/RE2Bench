The output `1/(a - b)` suggests that the function `radsimp` successfully rationalized and simplified a provided expression. The `radsimp` function is primarily designed to rationalize denominators that contain sums of radicals.

One common expression that rationalizes and simplifies to `1/(a - b)` is:
`1 / ((sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)) * (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))`

Let's trace the execution of `radsimp` with this input:
1.  The expression is `1 / d` where `d = (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)) * (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))`.
2.  `radsimp` calls `handle(expr)`.
3.  The denominator `d` is a `Mul`. The code iterates over arguments of the denominator: `elif d.is_Mul: return _unevaluated_Mul(*[handle(1 / d) for d in d.args])`.
4.  It computes `handle(1 / (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)))`:
    *   The denominator is `sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)`. The function identifies the terms and multiplies numerator and denominator by the conjugate `sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)`.
    *   Result: `(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) / (a - b)`.
5.  It computes `handle(1 / (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))`:
    *   The denominator is `sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)`. The function multiplies by the conjugate `sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)`.
    *   Result: `(sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)) / (a - b)`.
6.  The results are multiplied together: `((sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) * (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))) / ((a - b) * (a - b))`.
    *   Numerator becomes `(a - b)` (difference of squares).
    *   Denominator is `(a - b)**2`.
    *   Expression is `(a - b) / (a - b)**2`.
7.  Finally, `radsimp` performs simplification (via `gcd_terms` and `signsimp` at the end), which cancels the common factor `(a - b)`.
8.  The result is `1 / (a - b)`.
