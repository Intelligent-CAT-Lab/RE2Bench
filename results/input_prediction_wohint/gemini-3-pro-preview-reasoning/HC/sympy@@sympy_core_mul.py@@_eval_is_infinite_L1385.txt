To predict the input for `_eval_is_infinite` that results in `False`, we need to trace the execution path in the code.

[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_is_infinite` calls `self._eval_is_zero_infinite_helper()` and assigns the result to `seen_zero, seen_infinite`.
The return value logic is:
```python
        if seen_infinite is True and seen_zero is False:
            return True
        elif seen_infinite is False:
            return False
        else:
            return None
```
For the function to return `False`, the condition `seen_infinite is False` in the `elif` must be satisfied. This implies that `seen_infinite` must be exactly `False` after the helper function executes.

Now let's examine `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`. It iterates over `self.args`.
1. It initializes `seen_zero = False` and `seen_infinite = False`.
2. Inside the loop for each argument `a`:
    - Checks `if a.is_zero:`: if True, sets `seen_zero = True`. Does not change `seen_infinite` (unless conflict logic returns early).
    - Checks `elif a.is_infinite:`: if True, sets `seen_infinite = True`. This would make the final result not False. So, **`a.is_infinite` must not be `True`**.
    - `else:` (when `a.is_zero` is False or None, and `a.is_infinite` is False or None):
        - `if seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None:` -> sets `seen_infinite = None`. This would make the final result `None` (since the elif checks `is False`). So, **`a.is_infinite` must not be `None`**.

Therefore, for `seen_infinite` to remain `False` through the entire loop, `a.is_infinite` must be `False` for all arguments `a` in `self.args`. The value of `is_zero` does not change `seen_infinite` from `False` (it only affects `seen_zero`, or returns early with `None, None` if there's a conflict like 0 * infinity, but since all args must be finite, we won't have `is_infinite=True` args to conflict with).

I will construct an input `self` having `args` which is a list of objects (dictionaries) where `is_infinite` is `False`. I'll set `is_zero` to `False` as well for a standard finite non-zero number scenario.
