The function `_complement` computes the set difference `other - self`. The provided output corresponds to a `FiniteSet` containing the single element `1`. This implies that `1` was present in the set `other` and was *not* present in the set `self`. Furthermore, if `other` contained any additional elements (e.g., `2`), they must have been present in `self` to be removed from the result.

A common and minimal test case for this behavior is subtracting a singleton set from a set of two elements where one matches. For instance:
- `other` = `{1, 2}`
- `self` = `{2}`
- `other - self` = `{1}`

This scenario aligns with the output. We represent these sets as `FiniteSet` objects, whose internal state `_elements` is a `frozenset`.
