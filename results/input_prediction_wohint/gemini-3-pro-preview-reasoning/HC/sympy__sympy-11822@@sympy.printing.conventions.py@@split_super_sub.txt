To figure out the input for `split_super_sub` that yields `["Fvec", null, null]` (which corresponds to `("Fvec", [], [])` in Python, interpreting the JSON `null` as empty lists due to function logic), I will simulate the code execution.

1.  **Analyze Function Output**: The function returns a tuple `(name, supers, subs)`. The target output indicates `name="Fvec"`, `supers` is empty, and `subs` is empty.
    
2.  **Analyze Parameters**: The function takes a single argument `text`.
    
3.  **Trace Logic**:
    *   The function loops through `text` looking for separators `^` (caret), `__` (double underscore), and `_` (underscore).
    *   The first substring found before any separator is assigned to `name`.
    *   If a part starts with `^` or `__`, it goes into `supers`.
    *   If a part starts with `_` (and not `__`), it goes into `subs`.
    *   After parsing, `name` is checked against a regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`. If it matches (i.e., consists of letters followed by digits), the digits are stripped from `name` and added to the beginning of `subs`.

4.  **Reverse Engineer Input**:
    *   To get `name="Fvec"`, the string must start with "Fvec".
    *   To keep `supers` and `subs` empty, the string should **not** contain the separators `^`, `__`, or `_` after the name part.
    *   Additionally, the name "Fvec" must not trigger the trailing digit split. The string "Fvec" consists only of letters `[a-zA-Z]`. It has no trailing digits `[0-9]`. Therefore, the regex match fails, and "Fvec" remains as-is, with nothing added to `subs`.
    
5.  **Verify Candidate**:
    *   Input: `"Fvec"`
    *   Iteration 1: Scans "Fvec". No separators found. `part`="Fvec". `name`="Fvec".
    *   Loop ends.
    *   Regex Check: "Fvec" does not match `([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`.
    *   Return: `("Fvec", [], [])`.
    
     This matches the desired name and empty lists.
