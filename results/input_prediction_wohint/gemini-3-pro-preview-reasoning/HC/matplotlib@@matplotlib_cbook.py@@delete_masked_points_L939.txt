[THOUGHT]
The function `delete_masked_points(*args)` is designed to filter out indices from sequence arguments where the data is either invalid (NaN/Inf) or masked (if using `MaskedArray`). It takes a variable number of arguments.
1.  **Output Analysis**: The output is a list containing three elements:
    *   A numpy array of 10 floats: `[0.0, 0.05, ..., 0.45]`.
    *   A numpy array of 10 floats: `[0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95]`.
    *   `null` (which corresponds to Python's `None`).
2.  **Logic Trace**:
    *   The function establishes `nrecs` based on the length of the first argument (which must be 10 here).
    *   It iterates through `*args`. Arguments that are iterable (and not strings) with length equal to `nrecs` are treated as sequences to be filtered (`seqlist[i] = True`). Other arguments (like `None`) are marked as pass-through (`seqlist[i] = False`).
    *   It collects masks of valid points for all sequence arguments. If valid data is provided, the mask is all True.
    *   If no points are removed (`len(igood) < nrecs` is False), the data remains unchanged.
    *   Sequence arguments are converted to standard numpy arrays (or filled if MaskedArrays).
3.  **Input Deduction**:
    *   Since the output arrays contain clean, evenly spaced data (steps of 0.05) and no missing points (length is 10, consistent with the values), it implies that no filtering occurred. The simplest input is one where the input sequences match the output values and are valid (all finite, no masks).
    *   The third element being `null` indicates the third argument was `None`. `None` is not iterable, so the function correctly ignores it during filtering and returns it as is.
    *   The input arguments must be provided as a list (for `*args`), containing two lists of floats and one `null`.

Therefore, the input `args` will be a list containing the two float sequences and `null`.
