To determine the input for `make_blobs`, we analyze the characteristics of the output data `X` (features) and `y` (labels).

1.  **Analyze `n_samples`:**
    Counting the number of labels in `y` (or rows in `X`), we find there are 50 samples. The labels are 0, 1, and 2, which implies 3 centers. The distribution of labels is:
    -   Label 0: 17 samples
    -   Label 1: 17 samples
    -   Label 2: 16 samples
    This (17, 17, 16) split sums to 50, consistent with `n_samples=50` and 3 centers.

2.  **Analyze `centers`:**
    We examine the `X` values for each label to estimate the centroids:
    -   **Label 0:** Points like `[0.076, 0.073]`, `[-0.005, 0.020]`, `[0.015, -0.042]`. These are tightly clustered around `(0, 0)`.
    -   **Label 1:** Points like `[0.86, 0.92]`, `[0.99, 1.08]`, `[1.01, 1.06]`. These are clustered around `(1, 1)`.
    -   **Label 2:** Points like `[0.08, 1.39]`, `[0.00, 1.71]`, `[-0.42, 1.42]`, `[0.16, 0.72]`. The X values are centered around 0, and Y values are centered roughly around 1.2 or 1. Given 0 and 1 are clean integers used in other centers, `(0, 1)` is the most likely center, with the data mean shifted slightly due to noise or a specific seed. `(0, 1)` is a standard coordinate.
    
    Thus, `centers` is likely `[[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]`.

3.  **Analyze `cluster_std`:**
    The spread (standard deviation) of the points varies significantly by cluster:
    -   **Label 0 (Center `[0,0]`):** The range of values is very small (approx -0.1 to 0.1). A standard deviation of `0.05` would produce a 2-sigma range of +/- 0.1, which fits well.
    -   **Label 1 (Center `[1,1]`):** The values range roughly from 0.6 to 1.4. A standard deviation of `0.2` (2-sigma = 0.4) fits this spread.
    -   **Label 2 (Center `[0,1]`):** The values are much more spread out, roughly -0.4 to 0.6 in X and 0.4 to 1.7 in Y. The range is about +/- 1.0. A standard deviation of `0.5` fits (2-sigma = 1.0).
    
    This suggests `cluster_std = [0.05, 0.2, 0.5]`.

4.  **Other Parameters:**
    -   `shuffle=True` (default) is implied because the labels in `y` are mixed (e.g., `2, 0, 2, 1, ...`).
    -   `random_state`: While the specific output depends on the seed, exact prediction of the random seed (e.g., 0, 42) is difficult without brute force. However, the structural parameters (`centers`, `cluster_std`) are clearly manual inputs. We will assume the relevant inputs for reconstruction are the data generation parameters.

Based on this analysis, the input arguments can be reconstructed.
