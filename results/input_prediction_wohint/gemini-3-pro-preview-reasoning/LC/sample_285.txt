The function `f(text, ch)` returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `ch` in the string `text`. The given output is `5`. Therefore, we need to construct a `text` string and a `ch` string such that `ch` appears exactly 5 times in `text`.

One simple solution is to choose `ch` as "a" and `text` as "aaaaa".
`"aaaaa".count("a")` evaluates to `5`.
