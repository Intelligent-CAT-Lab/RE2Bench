The function `next_smallest` removes duplicates from the input list `lst` using `set()`, sorts the unique elements using `sorted()`, and returns the second smallest element (`lst[1]`) if it exists.

From the output `2`:
1. The result of `lst[1]` after processing is `2`.
2. This implies the list after `sorted(set(lst))` contains at least two elements, and the element at index 1 is `2`.
3. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the element at index 0 must be strictly less than `2`.
4. A simple integer less than 2 is 1.
5. Therefore, a possible sorted unique list is `[1, 2]`.
6. An input list `lst` that results in `[1, 2]` is `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, `[1, 2, 2]`, etc. We can select `[1, 2]` as a valid input.

[THOUGHT]
The function processes the input list by finding the unique elements and sorting them. It then returns the second element (index 1).
For the output to be `2`, the sorted unique list must look like `[x, 2, ...]` where `x < 2`.
I need to provide an input list `lst`.
If I choose `lst = [1, 2]`:
- `set([1, 2])` becomes `{1, 2}`.
- `sorted({1, 2})` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- The length is 2, which is not `< 2`.
- It returns `lst[1]`, which is `2`.
This matches the target output.
