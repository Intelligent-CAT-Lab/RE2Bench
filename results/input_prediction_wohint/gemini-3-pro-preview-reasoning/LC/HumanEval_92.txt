To find the input for the function `any_int` that results in the output `true`, I need to satisfy the conditions found in the code.

1.  **Type Check**: The function first checks `if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)`. This means `x`, `y`, and `z` must all be integers.
2.  **Logic Check**: Just inside that block, it checks `if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x`. If any of these equality checks evaluate to true, the function returns `True`. This basically means one of the numbers must be the sum of the other two.

I need to choose three integers that satisfy this relationship.
Let's select:
*   `x = 1`
*   `y = 2`

To satisfy `x + y == z`, `z` must be `1 + 2 = 3`.

Verification:
*   `x`, `y`, `z` are all integers.
*   `x + y` (1 + 2) equals `z` (3).
*   The function will return `True`.
