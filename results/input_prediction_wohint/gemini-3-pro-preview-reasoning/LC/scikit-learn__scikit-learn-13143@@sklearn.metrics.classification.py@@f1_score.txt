To determine the input for `f1_score` that results in an output of approximately `0.5333333333333333`, we analyze the definition of the F1 score.

[THOUGHT]
The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The formula for the binary F1 score of the positive class (default `pos_label=1`) is:
$$ F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN} $$
where $TP$ is True Positives, $FP$ is False Positives, and $FN$ is False Negatives.

The given output is $0.53333\dots$, which corresponds to the fraction $8/15$.
We set up the equation:
$$ \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN} = \frac{8}{15} $$
$$ 30 \cdot TP = 16 \cdot TP + 8(FP + FN) $$
$$ 14 \cdot TP = 8(FP + FN) $$
$$ 7 \cdot TP = 4(FP + FN) $$

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for $TP, FP, FN$.
Since 7 and 4 are coprime, $TP$ must be a multiple of 4.
Let $TP = 4$.
$$ 7(4) = 4(FP + FN) \implies 28 = 4(FP + FN) \implies FP + FN = 7 $$

We can choose integers for $FP$ and $FN$ that sum to 7. A simple choice is $FP = 3$ and $FN = 4$.
We construct the input arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` with these counts (using 1 as positive and 0 as negative):
- **TP = 4**: `y_true` has 1, `y_pred` has 1. (4 instances)
- **FP = 3**: `y_true` has 0, `y_pred` has 1. (3 instances)
- **FN = 4**: `y_true` has 1, `y_pred` has 0. (4 instances)

Total instances = $4 + 3 + 4 = 11$.

Constructing the lists:
`y_true`: 4 ones (TP) + 3 zeros (FP) + 4 ones (FN) -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
`y_pred`: 4 ones (TP) + 3 ones (FP) + 4 zeros (FN) -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Verifying:
Precision = $TP / (TP + FP) = 4 / (4 + 3) = 4/7$
Recall = $TP / (TP + FN) = 4 / (4 + 4) = 4/8 = 0.5$
F1 $= 2 * (4/7 * 1/2) / (4/7 + 1/2) = (4/7) / (15/14) = 8/15 \approx 0.5333...$
