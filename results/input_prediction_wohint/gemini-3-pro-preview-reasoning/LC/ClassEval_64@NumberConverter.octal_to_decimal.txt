The function `octal_to_decimal` takes an argument `octal_num` and converts it from base 8 (octal) to base 10 (decimal) using the built-in `int` function. The output provided is the decimal integer `21271`.

To find the input `octal_num`, we need to perform the inverse operation: converting the decimal number `21271` back into an octal string.

**Step-by-step conversion of 21271 to octal:**
1. Divide 21271 by 8:
   $21271 \div 8 = 2658$ with a remainder of **7**.
2. Divide 2658 by 8:
   $2658 \div 8 = 332$ with a remainder of **2**.
3. Divide 332 by 8:
   $332 \div 8 = 41$ with a remainder of **4**.
4. Divide 41 by 8:
   $41 \div 8 = 5$ with a remainder of **1**.
5. Divide 5 by 8:
   $5 \div 8 = 0$ with a remainder of **5**.

Reading the remainders from the last division to the first (bottom-up): **51427**.

**Verification:**
$5 \times 8^4 + 1 \times 8^3 + 4 \times 8^2 + 2 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0$
$= 5 \times 4096 + 1 \times 512 + 4 \times 64 + 2 \times 8 + 7 \times 1$
$= 20480 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7$
$= 21271$

The input to the `int()` function with a base argument must be a string. Therefore, `octal_num` is the string "51427".
