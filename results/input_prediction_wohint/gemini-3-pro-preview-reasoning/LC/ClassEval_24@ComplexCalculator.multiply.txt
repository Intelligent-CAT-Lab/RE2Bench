The function `ComplexCalculator.multiply(c1, c2)` calculates the product of two complex numbers.
The output provided is `(-5+10j)`, which corresponds to the complex number $-5 + 10i$.
We need to find two complex numbers $c1$ and $c2$ such that their product is $-5 + 10i$.
Let $c1 = a + bi$ and $c2 = c + di$.
The multiplication formula yields:
Real part: $ac - bd = -5$
Imaginary part: $ad + bc = 10$

We can look for integer solutions. The magnitude squared of the product is $|-5+10i|^2 = (-5)^2 + 10^2 = 25 + 100 = 125$.
We can factor 125 into $5 \times 25$. This suggests using complex numbers with magnitude squared of 5 and 25.
For $|c1|^2 = 5$, we can choose $1 + 2i$ (since $1^2 + 2^2 = 5$).
So, let $c1 = 1 + 2j$.
Then $(1+2j) \times c2 = -5 + 10j$.
$c2 = \frac{-5 + 10j}{1 + 2j} = \frac{(-5 + 10j)(1 - 2j)}{(1 + 2j)(1 - 2j)} = \frac{-5 + 10j + 10j - 20j^2}{1 + 4} = \frac{-5 + 20j + 20}{5} = \frac{15 + 20j}{5} = 3 + 4j$.
So, $c2 = 3 + 4j$.
Let's verify: $(1+2j) * (3+4j) = (1\times 3 - 2\times 4) + (1\times 4 + 2\times 3)j = (3 - 8) + (4 + 6)j = -5 + 10j$.
This matches the target output.

The inputs are complex numbers. In JSON, these are typically represented as strings. We will use the string representations `"1+2j"` and `"3+4j"`. The `self` object is empty as `__init__` does not take parameters or store state, and `multiply` is a static method.
