To determine the input for the function `f(array)` that results in the output `[]`, we need to analyze the operations performed by the function and construct an input list that satisfies the conditions to be emptied.

**Analysis of `f(array)`:**
The function performs three sequential `while` loops that modify the list in-place:
1.  **Loop 1:** `while -1 in array: array.pop(-3)`
    -   This loop runs as long as `-1` is in the list.
    -   It removes the element at index `-3` (the third element from the end).
    -   *Constraint:* For `pop(-3)` to work without raising an `IndexError`, the list must have a length of at least 3.
2.  **Loop 2:** `while 0 in array: array.pop()`
    -   This loop runs as long as `0` is in the list.
    -   It removes the last element of the list.
3.  **Loop 3:** `while 1 in array: array.pop(0)`
    -   This loop runs as long as `1` is in the list.
    -   It removes the first element of the list.

**Constructing the Input:**
We need an input list that, after passing through these loops, becomes empty. A simple valid input is `[]` (empty list), but a non-trivial input that exercises all loops is preferred to demonstrate understanding.

Let's work backwards or construct a list that triggers each loop exactly once to clear itself.

*   **Step 1 (Loop 1 - The `-1` trigger):**
    We need an integer `-1` in the list to trigger the first loop. To execute `pop(-3)` successfully, the list length must be at least 3. If the length is exactly 3, `pop(-3)` corresponds to index `0`. If we place `-1` at index 0 of a 3-element list, `pop(-3)` will remove it.
    *Draft Input:* `[-1, A, B]`
    *Execution:* `pop(-3)` removes index 0 (`-1`). The list becomes `[A, B]`. The loop terminates (assuming neither A nor B is -1).

*   **Step 2 (Loop 2 - The `0` trigger):**
    The current list is `[A, B]`. We need this to trigger the `0` loop. If we set `B` (the last element) to `0`, the condition `0 in array` is true. `pop()` removes the last element.
    *Draft Input:* `[-1, A, 0]`
    *Execution of Loop 1:* Becomes `[A, 0]`.
    *Execution of Loop 2:* `0` is present. `pop()` removes `0`. The list becomes `[A]`. The loop terminates (assuming A is not 0).

*   **Step 3 (Loop 3 - The `1` trigger):**
    The current list is `[A]`. We need this to trigger the `1` loop. If we set `A` to `1`, the condition `1 in array` is true. `pop(0)` removes the first element.
    *Draft Input:* `[-1, 1, 0]`
    *Execution of Loop 3:* `1` is present. `pop(0)` removes `1`. The list becomes `[]`.

**Verification of Input `[-1, 1, 0]`:**
1.  **Initial:** `[-1, 1, 0]`
2.  **While `-1`:** `-1` is in the list. `pop(-3)` (which is index 0 for length 3) removes `-1`. List becomes `[1, 0]`. Loop checks for `-1` again -> not found. Proceed.
3.  **While `0`:** `0` is in the list. `pop()` removes the last element `0`. List becomes `[1]`. Loop checks for `0` again -> not found. Proceed.
4.  **While `1`:** `1` is in the list. `pop(0)` removes the first element `1`. List becomes `[]`. Loop checks for `1` again -> not found. Proceed.
5.  **Return:** `[]`.

The input `[-1, 1, 0]` results in the desired output.

[THOUGHT]
The function `f` processes the input `array` through three stages. To get an output of `[]`, the input array must be cleared by these stages. 
1. The first loop removes the element at index -3 if `-1` is present. This implies the array must have at least 3 elements initially if it contains `-1`. Let's assume the array starts with `[-1, 1, 0]`.
2. First pass (`while -1`): `-1` is present. `len` is 3. `pop(-3)` targets index 0. Value `-1` is removed. Array becomes `[1, 0]`. Now `-1` is not present. Loop ends.
3. Second pass (`while 0`): `0` is present. `pop()` removes the last element (`0`). Array becomes `[1]`. Now `0` is not present. Loop ends.
4. Third pass (`while 1`): `1` is present. `pop(0)` removes the first element (`1`). Array becomes `[]`. Loop ends.
5. The function returns `[]`.
Thus, `[-1, 1, 0]` is a valid input that produces the target output.
