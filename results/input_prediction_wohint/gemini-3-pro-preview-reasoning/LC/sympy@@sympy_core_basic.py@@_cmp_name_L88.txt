To predict the input for `_cmp_name(x, y)` that results in `1`, we follow the logic of the function and the SymPy context.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze `_cmp_name(x, y)`**:
    *   The function takes two types `x` and `y`.
    *   It extracts their `__name__`.
    *   It checks `issubclass(y, Basic)`. If `y` is not a `Basic` subclass, it returns `-1`. Thus, for a result of `1`, `y` must be a subclass of `Basic`.
    *   It determines indices `i1` and `i2` from a global `ordering_of_classes`.
    *   **Case 1 (Unknown classes)**: If both are not in the list, it compares names alphabetically. To get `1`, we need `x.__name__ > y.__name__`.
    *   **Case 2 (Known classes)**: If at least one is in the list, it compares indices. `(i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2)`. To get `1`, we need `i1 > i2`. This implies `x` is "greater" (comes later in the list) than `y`.

2.  **Determine `ordering_of_classes`**:
    *   In the SymPy library (implied by helper functions like `_preorder_traversal`), `ordering_of_classes` defines the canonical ordering of expression types.
    *   The standard order typically puts simpler objects first: `Number`, `Symbol`, `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Function`.
    *   Therefore, `Add` comes before `Mul`.
    *   `i(Add) < i(Mul)`.

3.  **Select Candidates**:
    *   We need `x` such that `i(x) > i(y)`.
    *   Let's choose `x = sympy.core.mul.Mul` and `y = sympy.core.add.Add`.
    *   Check indices: `Mul` is after `Add`. `i(Mul) > i(Add)`. The return value is `1 - 0 = 1`.
    *   Check alphabetical (fallback): "Mul" > "Add". Both conditions satisfy the requirement.
    *   Check subclass: `Add` is a subclass of `Basic`. Valid.

4.  **Format Input**:
    *   The inputs `x` and `y` are types. In JSON, we will represent them by their fully qualified names or string representations compatible with the expected format (likely string proxies for the types as per standard dataset conventions).
    *   The structure should match the function arguments.
