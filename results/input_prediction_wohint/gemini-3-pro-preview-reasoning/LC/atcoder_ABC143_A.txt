The code accepts two integers, $A$ and $B$, separated by a space. It calculates $ans = A - 2B$. If the result is negative, it sets $ans$ to 0. Finally, it prints $ans$.

Given the output is `0`, we need $A$ and $B$ such that:
$ans = 0$ (if calculated value $\ge 0$)
OR
$ans < 0$ (which gets reset to 0).

Mathematically, we need $\max(0, A - 2B) = 0$. This implies $A - 2B \le 0$, or $A \le 2B$.

Let's choose arbitrary integers satisfying this condition.
Let $B = 10$. Then $2B = 20$.
We need $A \le 20$. Let's choose $A = 10$.

Let's trace the execution:
1. `input().split()` reads `"10 10"` and splits into `['10', '10']`.
2. `map(int, ...)` converts these to `A = 10` and `B = 10`.
3. `ans = 10 - 2 * 10 = 10 - 20 = -10`.
4. `if ans < 0:` checks if `-10 < 0`, which is true.
5. `ans = 0`.
6. `print(ans)` outputs `0`.

This matches the target output.
