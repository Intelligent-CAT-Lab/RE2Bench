The function `compare(game, guess)` calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the two input lists `game` and `guess`. The function returns a list of these differences.

The provided output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.

To reconstruct the input, we need to find two lists of numbers, let's call them `G` (game) and `g` (guess), such that:
1. `abs(G[0] - g[0]) = 2`
2. `abs(G[1] - g[1]) = 0`
3. `abs(G[2] - g[2]) = 0`
4. `abs(G[3] - g[3]) = 1`

Since `abs(x - y) = 0` implies `x = y`, the elements at indices 1 and 2 must be identical in both lists.
For index 0, the difference is 2. We can choose arbitrary values, for example, `G[0] = 2` and `g[0] = 0`.
For index 3, the difference is 1. We can choose, for example, `G[3] = 1` and `g[3] = 0`.
For indices 1 and 2, we can choose `0` for simplicity.

Thus, one possible valid input configuration is:
`game = [2, 0, 0, 1]`
`guess = [0, 0, 0, 0]`

Verifying this:
Index 0: `abs(2 - 0) = 2`
Index 1: `abs(0 - 0) = 0`
Index 2: `abs(0 - 0) = 0`
Index 3: `abs(1 - 0) = 1`
Result: `[2, 0, 0, 1]`. This matches the output.
