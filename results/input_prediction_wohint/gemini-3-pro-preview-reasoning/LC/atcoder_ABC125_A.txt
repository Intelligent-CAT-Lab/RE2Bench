[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the input `A, B, T` for the python script given that the output is `1`.

1.  **Analyze the Code**:
    The script reads a single line of input, splits it by spaces, converts the parts to integers, and assigns them to `A`, `B`, and `T`.
    It then calculates `ans` using the expression `T // A * B`.
    Finally, it prints `ans`.

2.  **Analyze the Expression**:
    The expression is `T // A * B`. In Python, the integer division operator `//` and the multiplication operator `*` have the same precedence and are left-associative. Therefore, the expression is evaluated as `(T // A) * B`.

3.  **Analyze the Target Output**:
    The code produces the output `1`. So, we must have:
    `(T // A) * B = 1`

4.  **Determine Possible Values**:
    Since `A`, `B`, and `T` are integers (derived from `map(int, ...)`):
    *   The term `(T // A)` results in an integer.
    *   Let `K = T // A`. Then `K * B = 1`.
    *   For the product of two integers `K` and `B` to be `1`, both must be `1` or both must be `-1`.
    
    *Assumption*: competitive programming tasks typically use positive integers for inputs like time intervals or counts. Therefore, we assume positive values.
    
    *   This implies `B = 1` and `K = 1`.
    *   Since `K = T // A = 1`, this value implies that `A` divides into `T` exactly once. Mathematically, this inequality must hold: `A <= T < 2 * A`.

5.  **Construct a Valid Input**:
    We need to satisfy:
    *   `B = 1`
    *   `A <= T < 2A`
    
    We can choose simple integers that fit these criteria.
    Let's choose `A = 3`.
    Then `T` must be between 3 and 5 (inclusive of 3, exclusive of 6). Let's pick `T = 3`.
    Let's verify:
    `A = 3`, `B = 1`, `T = 3`
    `ans = 3 // 3 * 1`
    `ans = 1 * 1`
    `ans = 1`
    
    This matches the output. The input string would be `"3 1 3"`.
    Another valid option is `"10 1 10"`, or `"2 1 3"`. Any satisfying the constraints works. I will provide `"3 1 3"`.
