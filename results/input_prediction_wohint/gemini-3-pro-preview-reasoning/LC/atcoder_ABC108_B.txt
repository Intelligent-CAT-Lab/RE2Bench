[THOUGHT]
The Python code reads four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ from the input.
Then it calculates two intermediate variables:
$a = x_2 - x_1$
$b = y_2 - y_1$

Finally, it prints four values separated by spaces:
1. $x_2 - b$
2. $y_2 + a$
3. $x_1 - b$
4. $y_1 + a$

Given the output `101 99 101 100`, we can set up the following equations:
1. $x_2 - b = 101$
2. $y_2 + a = 99$
3. $x_1 - b = 101$
4. $y_1 + a = 100$

We can solve this system of equations.
Subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):
$(x_2 - b) - (x_1 - b) = 101 - 101$
$x_2 - x_1 = 0$
Since $a = x_2 - x_1$, we have $a = 0$.

Now substitute $a = 0$ into equations (2) and (4):
From (2): $y_2 + 0 = 99 \implies y_2 = 99$
From (4): $y_1 + 0 = 100 \implies y_1 = 100$

Now we can calculate $b$:
$b = y_2 - y_1 = 99 - 100 = -1$

Substitute $b = -1$ into equations (1) and (3) to find $x_1$ and $x_2$:
From (1): $x_2 - (-1) = 101 \implies x_2 + 1 = 101 \implies x_2 = 100$
From (3): $x_1 - (-1) = 101 \implies x_1 + 1 = 101 \implies x_1 = 100$

So the values are:
$x_1 = 100$
$y_1 = 100$
$x_2 = 100$
$y_2 = 99$

The input expects these four values separated by spaces: `100 100 100 99`.
