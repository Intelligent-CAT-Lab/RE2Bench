The function `maximum` takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.
It first checks if `k` is 0. If so, it returns an empty list.
Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` in place in ascending order.
Then, it creates `ans` by slicing the last `k` elements of the sorted array (`arr[-k:]`).
Finally, it returns `ans`.

Based on the provided output:
1.  The output is `[-4, 4]`. This is a list containing two elements.
2.  Since the output comes from `arr[-k:]`, the length of the output list determines `k`. The length is 2, so `k` is likely 2. (If `k` were larger than the list length, it would return the whole list, but `k=2` is the most direct inference).
3.  The output `[-4, 4]` represents the `k` largest elements of the input array `arr`, sorted in ascending order.
4.  This implies that `4` is the maximum value in `arr`, and `-4` is the second largest value in `arr`.
5.  Any other elements in `arr`, if they existed, would have to be less than or equal to `-4`.
6.  To reconstruct a valid input, we can assume the input array `arr` contained exactly the elements found in the output. The order in the input doesn't strictly matter because the function sorts it, but providing them works.

Therefore, a valid input is `arr = [-4, 4]` (or `[4, -4]`) and `k = 2`.
Simulation with these values:
- `k=2` (nonzero)
- `arr` = `[-4, 4]`
- `arr.sort()` -> `arr` remains `[-4, 4]`
- `ans = arr[-2:]` -> `[-4, 4]`
- Returns `[-4, 4]`. This matches the output.
