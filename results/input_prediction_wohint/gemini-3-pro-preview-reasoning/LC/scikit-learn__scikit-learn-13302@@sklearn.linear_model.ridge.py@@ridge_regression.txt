The user wants to find the input arguments for `ridge_regression` that produce the output coefficients `[-0.22704354  0.14145671 -0.1168167  -1.4226984  -0.87262106]`.

1.  **Analyze the Function**: The function `ridge_regression(X, y, alpha, ...)` performs L2-regularized least squares. The closed-form solution (for the primal form) is $w = (X^T X + \alpha I)^{-1} X^T y$. Ideally, we need to determine `X`, `y`, and `alpha`.

2.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is a vector of naturally occuring floating point numbers of length 5. This indicates that the input feature matrix `X` must have 5 columns (features), and `y` must align with `X` in terms of samples.

3.  **Formulate Constraints**: This is an inverse problem with infinite solutions. To "predict" the input, we can reconstruct a **canonical input** that guarantees this output deterministically.
    *   We need to choose `X`, `y`, and `alpha` such that the formula yields the output vectors.
    *   To simplify the math ($K^{-1}v$), let's choose `X` and `alpha` such that the transformation matrix becomes an identity matrix or a simple scalar.

4.  **Construct Inputs**:
    *   **Matrix X**: Let's set `X` to be the $5 \times 5$ Identity matrix ($I_5$). This creates a scenario with 5 samples and 5 independent features. $X^T X = I$.
    *   **Alpha**: If we set `alpha` to `0`, the term $(X^T X + \alpha I)$ becomes $(I + 0) = I$. The inverse matches the identity.
    *   **Vector y**: with $X=I$ and $\alpha=0$, the equation becomes $w = I^{-1} I^T y = I y = y$.
    *   Therefore, if we set the input `y` to be exactly the observed output coefficient vector, and `X` as Identity, and `alpha` as 0, the function will return `y`. This is a valid simulation path. (Note: Using $\alpha=1.0$ would require setting `y` to $2 \times$ output, but $\alpha=0$ is the most direct reconstruction).

5.  **Simulation Step**:
    *   Call `ridge_regression` with `X = 5x5 Identity`, `y = [-0.227..., ...]`, `alpha = 0`.
    *   The solver computes weights. Since the system is orthogonal and unregularized, the weights equal the target values.
    *   Result: `[-0.22704354, 0.14145671, -0.1168167, -1.4226984, -0.87262106]`. Matches expected output.

6.  **Formatting**: Arguments `X`, `y`, and `alpha` are placed in the `args` dictionary. `y` values are extracted from the string representation in the prompt.
