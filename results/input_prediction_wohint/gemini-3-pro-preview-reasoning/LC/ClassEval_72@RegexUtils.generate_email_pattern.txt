The function `generate_email_pattern` within the `RegexUtils` class is defined as `def generate_email_pattern(self):`. It takes no arguments other than `self`. Inside the function, it assigns a specific hardcoded regular expression string to the variable `pattern` and returns it. It does not access any instance attributes (like `self.variable`), nor does it take any input parameters.

Therefore, to produce the given output, the function is simply called with no arguments on an instance of `RegexUtils`. The instance state is irrelevant.

[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern` takes no arguments (except `self`).
It returns a hardcoded string constant defined within the function body: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
The provided output matches this return value exactly.
Since the function does not use any instance variables (attributes of `self`) or accept any parameters, the input representation for `self` is empty, and `args`/`kwargs` are also empty.
