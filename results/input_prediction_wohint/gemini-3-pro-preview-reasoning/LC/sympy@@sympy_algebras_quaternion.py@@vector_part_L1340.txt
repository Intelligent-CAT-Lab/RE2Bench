The function `vector_part` creates a new `Quaternion` using `self.b`, `self.c`, `self.d` and a fixed real part `0`.
The `__new__` method of `Quaternion` takes `(a, b, c, d)` and initializes the object. `Quaternion` inherits from `Expr`, so its mathematical components are stored in `_args`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `"0 + x*i + y*j + z*k"`. This represents a Quaternion where the scalar part is 0, the `i` component is `x`, the `j` component is `y`, and the `k` component is `z`.
2.  **Analyze the Function**: The method `vector_part(self)` returns `Quaternion(0, self.b, self.c, self.d)`.
3.  **Map Output to Input**:
    *   The resulting Quaternion's `b` component (coefficient of `i`) is `x`. Thus, `self.b` must be `x`.
    *   The resulting `c` component (coefficient of `j`) is `y`. Thus, `self.c` must be `y`.
    *   The resulting `d` component (coefficient of `k`) is `z`. Thus, `self.d` must be `z`.
    *   The resulting real part is hardcoded to `0` by the function, so it doesn't reveal `self.a`.
4.  **Reconstruct `self`**:
    *   `self` is a `Quaternion`.
    *   The properties `b`, `c`, `d` correspond to indices 1, 2, and 3 of the stored arguments (`_args`) of the expression.
    *   So, `_args[1] = "x"`, `_args[2] = "y"`, `_args[3] = "z"`.
    *   `_args[0]` (the real part `a`) is unknown. However, standard quaternion notation is $q = w + xi + yj + zk$. A reasonable generic input for this test case is a quaternion with a scalar symbol `w` to demonstrate that `vector_part` discards it.
    *   Therefore, we assume `self` represents `Quaternion(w, x, y, z)`.
    *   The internal arguments `_args` would be `["w", "x", "y", "z"]`.
    *   Instance attributes initialized by `__new__` include `_real_field` (default `True`) and `_norm` (default `None`).
5.  **Construct JSON**: The inputs to `vector_part` are just `self`. `args` and `kwargs` are empty. `self` state is defined by its attributes.
