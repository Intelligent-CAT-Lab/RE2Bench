[THOUGHT]
The function `RegexUtils.split` calls `re.split(pattern, text)`.
The provided output is `['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']`.
The behavior of `re.split` is to break the `text` string wherever `pattern` matches.
1. The list definitely has 4 elements. This implies there were 3 matches of `pattern` in `text` (since $N$ matches result in $N+1$ fragments).
2. The first element is `""` (empty string). This implies that a match occurred at the very beginning of the `text`.
3. The last element is `""` (empty string). This implies that a match occurred at the very end of the `text`.
4. The middle elements are `' abiguygusu '` and `' kjgufwycs '`.
5. Since the middle elements retain their leading and trailing spaces, the pattern does not match whitespace (otherwise the spaces would be consumed or the split would happen elsewhere).
6. The structure of the text can be reconstructed as: `[MATCH] + ' abiguygusu ' + [MATCH] + ' kjgufwycs ' + [MATCH]`.
7. We need to choose a `pattern` that acts as a delimiter and does not appear inside the strings `' abiguygusu '` or `' kjgufwycs '`.
8. A comma `,` is a common simple separator for such examples. If we assume `pattern` is `,`:
   - `text` becomes `, abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,`.
9. Let's verify: `re.split(',', ', abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,')`:
   - Match at index 0 (`,`) -> yields `""`, remainder `' abiguygusu , kjgufwycs ,'`.
   - Match after `' abiguygusu '` (`,`) -> yields `' abiguygusu '`, remainder `' kjgufwycs ,'`.
   - Match after `' kjgufwycs '` (`,`) -> yields `' kjgufwycs '`, remainder `""`.
   - End of string yields `""`.
   - Result: `['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']`.
This matches the output perfectly.

The `RegexUtils` class does not have an `__init__` method, so it does not store any state. The `self` dictionary should be empty. The arguments `pattern` and `text` will be mapped in the `args` dictionary.
