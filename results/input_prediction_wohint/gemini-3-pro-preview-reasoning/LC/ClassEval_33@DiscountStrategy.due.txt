The `due` method calculates the final amount to be paid by subtracting any discount from the total.

1.  **Analyze `due` Logic**: The method `due` executes `return self.__total - discount`.
2.  **Determine Discount**: The `discount` is derived from `self.promotion`. If `self.promotion` is `None`, the discount is 0. If it is a function, it calculates the discount. Since passing a function definition via JSON is undefined in this context, the standard assumption is that `self.promotion` is `None` (or `null` in JSON).
3.  **Solve for Total**: If `discount` is 0, then `self.__total - 0 = 139.5`. Thus, `self.__total` must be `139.5`.
4.  **Identify State Attributes**: The instance requires `customer`, `cart`, `promotion`, and `__total` (created in `__init__`).
5.  **Handle Name Mangling**: The attribute `self.__total` is a private variable (starts with double underscore). In Python, this is name-mangled to `_ClassName__variable`. For the class `DiscountStrategy`, the attribute stored in `self` is `_DiscountStrategy__total`. The input state must reflect this mangled name for the method to access it.
6.  **Construct Input**:
    *   `self.promotion`: `null`
    *   `self._DiscountStrategy__total`: `139.5`
    *   `self.customer`: Generic string (e.g., "John Doe")
    *   `self.cart`: Generic list (e.g., `[]`), as it's not accessed when `promotion` is None.
    *   `args`: Empty, as `due` takes no arguments.
