The code reads four integers `anti`, `b`, `c`, `d`. It calculates `l = abs(anti - c)` and `m = abs(b - d)`.
Then it enters a conditional structure:
1.  `if anti == c`: It prints `anti + m, b, c + m, d`.
2.  `elif b == d`: It prints `anti, b + l, c, d + l`.
3.  `elif l != m`: It prints `-1`.
4.  `else`: It prints `anti, d, c, b`.

The given output is "3 8 7 4". This corresponds to 4 integers, neither of which is -1, so line 3 is skipped.
Let's test which condition produced this output.

**Hypothesis 1:** The output came from `if anti == c`.
The print maps to variables: `anti + m` is 3, `b` is 8, `c + m` is 7, `d` is 4.
So `b = 8`, `d = 4`. Calculate `m = abs(b - d) = abs(8 - 4) = 4`.
Then `anti + 4 = 3` => `anti = -1`.
And `c + 4 = 7` => `c = 3`.
Check condition `anti == c`: `-1 == 3` is False. This hypothesis is incorrect.

**Hypothesis 2:** The output came from `elif b == d`.
The print maps to variables: `anti` is 3, `b + l` is 8, `c` is 7, `d + l` is 4.
So `anti = 3`, `c = 7`. Calculate `l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4`.
Then `b + 4 = 8` => `b = 4`.
And `d + 4 = 4` => `d = 0`.
Check condition `b == d`: `4 == 0` is False. This hypothesis is incorrect.

**Hypothesis 3:** The output came from `else`.
The print maps to variables: `anti` is 3, `d` is 8, `c` is 7, `b` is 4.
So `anti = 3`, `d = 8`, `c = 7`, `b = 4`.
Let's verify the conditions for reaching the `else` block with these values:
1. `anti = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 7`, `d = 8`.
2. `l = abs(3 - 7) = 4`.
3. `m = abs(4 - 8) = 4`.
4. `if anti == c` -> `3 == 7` is False.
5. `elif b == d` -> `4 == 8` is False.
6. `elif l != m` -> `4 != 4` is False.
7. `else` block executes.
8. Prints `anti, d, c, b` -> `3, 8, 7, 4`. This matches the output.

The input was the string "3 4 7 8".
