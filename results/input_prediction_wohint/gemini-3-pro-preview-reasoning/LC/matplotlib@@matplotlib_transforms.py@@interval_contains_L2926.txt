[THOUGHT]
The function `interval_contains(interval, val)` takes two arguments. `interval` is expected to be an iterable with two elements (e.g., a list or tuple of two numbers), and `val` is a number.
The logic unpacks `interval` into `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, it swaps them so that `a` is the lower bound and `b` is the upper bound. Finally, it checks if `val` lies inclusively between `a` and `b` (`a <= val <= b`).

The desired output is `{"output": "np.True_"}`. This indicates the function should return `True`. The string `"np.True_"` suggests the return value is a NumPy boolean evaluating to True, but functionally it means the condition `a <= val <= b` must be satisfied.

I need to construct an input where `val` is inside `interval`.
1. Choose an arbitrary interval, say `[0, 10]`. Here `a=0`, `b=10`.
2. Since `0 <= 10`, no swap occurs.
3. Choose a `val` between 0 and 10, say `5`.
4. The check `0 <= 5 <= 10` is `True`.

This validates the input. I will formulate the input JSON with these parameters.

Steps:
- Input `interval`: `[0, 10]`
- Input `val`: `5`
- Execution: `a, b = 0, 10` -> `0 <= 5 <= 10` -> returns `True`.
