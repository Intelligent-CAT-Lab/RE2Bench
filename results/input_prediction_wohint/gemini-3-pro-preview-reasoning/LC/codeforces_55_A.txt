To determine the input that produces the output "NO", we analyze the Python code step by step.

1.  **Code Analysis**:
    *   `n = int(input())`: The program accepts an input and converts it to an integer.
    *   `while n % 2 == 0: n /= 2`: The program enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is even. Inside the loop, `n` is divided by 2. Effectively, this removes all factors of 2 from the number.
    *   `if n == 1:`: After the loop, the program checks if the remaining number is 1.
        *   If `n == 1`, it prints 'YES'. This logic identifies if the original number was a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8...).
    *   `else: print('NO')`: If `n` is not 1, it means the number has prime factors other than 2.

2.  **Target Output**:
    *   The desired output is `"NO"`.

3.  **Deduction**:
    *   To get "NO", the `else` branch must be executed.
    *   This implies the condition `n == 1` must evaluate to `False` after the `while` loop finishes.
    *   Therefore, the initial input must be an integer that is **not** a power of 2 (and not 0, as that causes an infinite loop).
    *   Examples of numbers that are not powers of 2 include: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, etc.

4.  **Verification (Simulation)**:
    *   Let's choose the number **3**.
    *   `n = 3`.
    *   `while 3 % 2 == 0`: 3 is odd, so `3 % 2` is 1 (not 0). The loop condition is False immediately.
    *   `if 3 == 1`: False.
    *   `else`: Print 'NO'.
    *   This matches the target output.
