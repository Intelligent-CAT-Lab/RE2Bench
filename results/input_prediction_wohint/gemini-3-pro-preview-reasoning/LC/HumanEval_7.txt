The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring, and returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that contain the specified substring.

**Step-by-step derivation:**
1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is `['grunt', 'prune']`.
2.  **Determine `strings` input:** The output is a subset of the input `strings`. Therefore, the input `strings` must have contained at least `"grunt"` and `"prune"`. The simplest assumption is that the input list was exactly `['grunt', 'prune']`, or perhaps contained other strings that were filtered out.
3.  **Determine `substring` input:** The `substring` must be present in every element of the output list.
    *   In `"grunt"`, we have substrings: "g", "gr", "gru", "grun", "grunt", "r", "ru", "run", "run", ...
    *   In `"prune"`, we have substrings: "p", "pr", "pru", "prun", "prune", "r", "ru", "run", "rune", ...
    *   Comparing the words `"grunt"` and `"prune"`, the longest common substring is `"run"` (g-**run**-t, p-**run**-e). Other possibilities include "ru", "un", "u", "n", "r", but "run" is the most specific non-trivial string connecting them.
4.  **Construct Inputs:**
    *   `substring` = `"run"`
    *   `strings` = `["grunt", "prune"]` (Minimal case where nothing is filtered out, or just the matching elements are provided).
