[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes an input `array`.
It processes this array by creating a new list `just_ns` where each element of `array` is used to repeat the character 'n'.
Then, it iterates over `just_ns` and appends every item to `final_output`, which is initially empty.
Finally, it returns `final_output`.

The goal is to find an input `array` that results in the output `[]` (an empty list).
Since `final_output` is constructed by appending elements from `just_ns`, `final_output` will only be empty if `just_ns` is empty.
`just_ns` is created via `list(map(..., array))`. The result of a `map` operation converted to a list is empty only if the input iterable (`array`) is empty.
If `array` contained any numbers (even 0), `just_ns` would contain strings (e.g., `""` for 0), resulting in `final_output` being `[""]`, not `[]`.
Therefore, `array` must be an empty list `[]`.
