To predict the input for the `__ge__` method of the `ceiling` class, we analyze the code path and the provided output.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `{"output": "ceiling(x) >= x"}`. This string representation corresponds to a `Ge` (Greater than or Equal) object in SymPy: `Ge(ceiling(x), x)`.

2.  **Analyze the Code**:
    The `__ge__` method for the `ceiling` class is:
    ```python
    def __ge__(self, other):
        if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real:
            return S.true
        if other is S.NegativeInfinity and self.is_real:
            return S.true
        return Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)
    ```
    The method takes `self` and `other` as inputs.

3.  **Trace the Execution**:
    - The code returns `Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)`. This means the preceding `if` conditions must have evaluated to `False` (or did not trigger a return).
    - From the output string `"ceiling(x) >= x"`:
        - The Left Hand Side (LHS) is `ceiling(x)`, which implies `self` is an instance of `ceiling` with argument `x`. So, `self.args[0]` is `x`.
        - The Right Hand Side (RHS) is `x`, which implies `other` is `x`.
    - Evaluating the first condition: `if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real:`
        - `self.args[0]` is `x` and `other` is `x`. So `self.args[0] == other` is `True`.
        - For the execution to proceed to the return statement, `other.is_real` must be `False` or `None` (falsy).
    - Evaluating the second condition: `if other is S.NegativeInfinity ...`
        - `other` is `x`, not `NegativeInfinity`. This is False.
    - Thus, the execution falls through to `return Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)`.

4.  **Determine Input Values**:
    - `self`: Must be a `ceiling` object containing a symbol `x`. In SymPy, objects store their arguments in `_args`.
    - `other`: Must be the symbol `x`.
    - The symbol `x` must be generic (specifically, `is_real` is not True). This is the default state for `Symbol('x')`.

5.  **Construct Input JSON**:
    - We represent the `self` object by its internal state attribute `_args`.
    - We represent the `other` argument as a Symbol with name "x".
