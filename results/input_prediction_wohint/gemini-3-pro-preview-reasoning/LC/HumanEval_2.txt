The function `truncate_number(number)` computes the fractional part of a floating-point number using the modulo operator: `number % 1.0`.

1.  **Analyze the output**: The given output is `0.33000000000000007`. This looks like a floating-point representation of the decimal `0.33`.
2.  **Analyze floating-point behavior**:
    *   If the input were exactly `0.33` (as a float), the operation `0.33 % 1.0` return `0.33` exactly (printed as `0.33`).
    *   The value `0.33000000000000007` arises from floating-point arithmetic errors, typically when subtracting an integer from a float that has a fractional part of `0.33`.
    *   Let's test common values:
        *   `1.33 % 1.0` results in `0.33000000000000007`.
        *   `3.33 % 1.0` results in `0.33000000000000007`.
3.  **Determine the most likely input**: In the context of coding problems (like HumanEval where this function appears), `3.5` is a common test case, but for `0.33...`, `3.33` is the standard "random" test number used to demonstrate floating point truncation. Since `3.33` produces the exact output provided, it is the predicted input.
