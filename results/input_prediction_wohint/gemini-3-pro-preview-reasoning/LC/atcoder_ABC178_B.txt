[THOUGHT]
The Python code reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from a single line of input. It then calculates four products: `a*c`, `a*d`, `b*c`, and `b*d` and prints the maximum of these values. This logic describes finding the maximum product of two numbers where the first allows a choice between `a` or `b` and the second allows a choice between `c` or `d` (often related to interval arithmetic endpoints).

We are given the output `56183721947132200`. We need to construct an input string containing four integers separated by spaces such that `max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d)` equals this output.

Since we have four variables to determine a single output value, there are infinitely many valid solutions. The most straightforward strategy is to force one of the products (e.g., `a*c`) to equal the target output and ensure the others are not larger.
1. Target value $Y = 56183721947132200$.
2. We want $a \times c = Y$. We can choose integers $a = Y$ and $c = 1$.
3. We need the maximum of $\{a \times c, a \times d, b \times c, b \times d\}$ to be exactly $Y$.
4. Currently, $a \times c = Y$. Since $Y$ is positive, we can set the unused variables $b$ and $d$ to 0. This makes the other products:
   - $a \times d = Y \times 0 = 0$
   - $b \times c = 0 \times 1 = 0$
   - $b \times d = 0 \times 0 = 0$
5. The list of products is $[Y, 0, 0, 0]$. Since $Y > 0$, the maximum is $Y$.
6. Thus, assigning $a=56183721947132200$, $b=0$, $c=1$, $d=0$ is a valid solution.

The input string will be these four numbers separated by spaces.
