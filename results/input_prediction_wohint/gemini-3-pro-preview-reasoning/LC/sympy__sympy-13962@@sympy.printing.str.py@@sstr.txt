To predict the input `expr` for the `sstr` function that results in the output `"Permutation([1, 0], size=6)"`, we simulate the execution of `sstr` and the printer methods.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output is `"Permutation([1, 0], size=6)"`. This is a string representation of a SymPy `Permutation` object.
2.  **Trace the Function Call**:
    *   `sstr(expr, **settings)` creates a `StrPrinter` and calls `doprint(expr)`.
    *   `doprint` calls `_print(expr)`.
    *   The output format indicates that `_print_Permutation` was called, which confirms that `expr` is an instance of `sympy.combinatorics.permutations.Permutation`.
3.  **Analyze `_print_Permutation` Logic**:
    *   The function checks `Permutation.print_cyclic`. The output uses the array form syntax (square brackets), suggesting `print_cyclic` is `False`.
    *   The code calculates `s = expr.support()`.
    *   It defines `Use` based on a comparison between `trim` (truncated array form with size) and `full` (full array form).
    *   The output matches the `trim` format: `'Permutation(%s)' % use`, where `use` is `"[1, 0], size=6"`.
    *   `trim` is constructed as `str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) + ', size=%s' % expr.size`.
4.  **Reconstruct the Object**:
    *   The size part of the string explicitly says `size=6`. So, `expr.size` is 6.
    *   The array part is `[1, 0]`. This corresponds to `expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]`.
    *   Since the size is 6, the full array form would be `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (assuming indices 0 and 1 represent a swap, and the rest are fixed points which are omitted in the trim).
    *   The support `s` for `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `[0, 1]`. `s[-1]` is 1. `array_form[:1+1]` is `[1, 0]`. Matches the visible part.
    *   Let's check the length condition:
        *   `trim`: `"[1, 0], size=6"` (length 14).
        *   `full`: `"[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]"` (length 18).
        *   `len(trim) < len(full)` is True, so `trim` is used.
    *   Thus, the input `expr` is a permutation of size 6 that swaps 0 and 1.
5.  **Formulate Input**:
    *   The object can be constructed via `Permutation([1, 0], size=6)`.
    *   The `sstr` function arguments are `expr` and `settings`. `settings` is empty as no specific options are implied by the default output format.
