[THOUGHT]
The function `ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2)` takes two complex numbers and returns their difference. The logic is explicit: it subtracts the real parts and the imaginary parts separately and constructs a new complex number.

The provided output is `"(2-2j)"`. In Python, this represents a complex number with a real part of `2` and an imaginary part of `-2`.
So, we are looking for inputs `c1` and `c2` such that `c1 - c2 = 2 - 2j`.

Since there are two unknowns and one equation, there are infinite solutions. I can choose an arbitrary value for `c1` and calculate the required `c2`.

Let's deduce a pair of values:
1.  We need `c1.real - c2.real = 2`. Let's choose `c1.real = 4`, which implies `c2.real = 2`.
2.  We need `c1.imag - c2.imag = -2`. Let's choose `c1.imag = 3`, which implies `c2.imag = 5` (since `3 - 5 = -2`).

So:
*   `c1 = 4 + 3j`
*   `c2 = 2 + 5j`

Verification:
`(4 + 3j) - (2 + 5j) = (4 - 2) + (3 - 5)j = 2 - 2j`. This matches the output.

The inputs in the JSON format for non-standard JSON types like complex numbers are typically represented as strings matching their Python representation. The `self` object is empty because `__init__` does not set any attributes.
