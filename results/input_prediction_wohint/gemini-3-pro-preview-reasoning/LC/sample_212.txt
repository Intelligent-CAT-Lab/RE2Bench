The function `f(nums)` reverses the list `nums` `len(nums) - 1` times.
Let $N$ be the length of the list `nums`. The loop runs $N - 1$ times.
The `reverse()` operation toggles the list between its original order and its reversed order.
- If the number of reversals ($N - 1$) is **even**, the list returns to its original order.
- If the number of reversals ($N - 1$) is **odd**, the list ends up reversed.

We are given the output: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
Let's count the number of elements in the output list to determine $N$.
The list has 7 elements: $1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3$.
So, $N = 7$.

Calculate the number of reversals:
$k = N - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$.

Since 6 is an **even** number, the list was reversed an even number of times. This means the final state of the list is the same as the initial state.
Therefore, the input `nums` is identical to the output.

Input: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
