[THOUGHT]
The code snippet performs a simple character transformation.
1. `input()` captures the input string. Since `ord()` requires a string of length 1, the input must be a single character.
2. `ord(input())` converts the character to its integer Unicode code point.
3. `+ 1` increments this integer value.
4. `chr(...)` converts the incremented integer back into a character.
5. `print(...)` outputs the resulting character.

The given output is "b".
We need to solve the equation: `chr(ord(input) + 1) == "b"`.

Reverse steps:
1. `ord(input) + 1 == ord("b")`
2. The ASCII value of "b" is 98.
3. `ord(input) + 1 == 98`
4. `ord(input) == 97`
5. The character with ASCII value 97 is "a".

Therefore, the input must be "a".
