The function `calculate_binary_info` calculates statistics based on the string stored in `self.binary_string`.
It returns a dictionary with:
1.  `Bit length`: The total length of the binary string.
2.  `Zeroes`: The count of '0' characters divided by the total length.
3.  `Ones`: The count of '1' characters divided by the total length.

Given the output:
-   `Bit length`: 40
-   `Zeroes`: 0.475
-   `Ones`: 0.525

I can calculate the required counts of '0's and '1's in `self.binary_string`:
-   Count of '0': $40 \times 0.475 = 19$.
-   Count of '1': $40 \times 0.525 = 21$.
-   Check: $19 + 21 = 40$.

Since the specific internal order of the bits does not affect the statistics, any string of length 40 containing exactly 19 '0's and 21 '1's is a valid state for `self.binary_string` when this method is called. I will construct a simple string with twenty-one '1's followed by nineteen '0's.
