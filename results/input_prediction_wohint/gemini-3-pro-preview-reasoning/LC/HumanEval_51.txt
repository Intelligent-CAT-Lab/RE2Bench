The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` and returns a new string with all characters from the original text except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (case-insensitive).

[THOUGHT]
The output is `"bcdf\nghjklm"`.
1. Analyze the first line `"bcdf"`. This sequence corresponds to the alphabetical order `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`. If we fill in the missing letters from the start of the alphabet (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`), we see that `a` and `e` are vowels. If the input was `"abcdef"`, the function would remove `a` and `e`, leaving `"bcdf"`.
2. Analyze the second line `"ghjklm"`. This continues the alphabet (`g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`). The letter `i` is a vowel. If the input segment was `"ghijklm"`, the function would remove `i`, leaving `"ghjklm"`.
3. Combine the parts. The output has a newline `\n` between the two parts.
4. Construct the likely input: `"abcdef"` + `"\n"` + `"ghijklm"` = `"abcdef\nghijklm"`.
5. Verify simulation:
   - Input: `"abcdef\nghijklm"`
   - 'a' (remove), 'b' (keep), 'c' (keep), 'd' (keep), 'e' (remove), 'f' (keep) -> "bcdf"
   - '\n' (keep)
   - 'g' (keep), 'h' (keep), 'i' (remove), 'j' (keep), 'k' (keep), 'l' (keep), 'm' (keep) -> "ghjklm"
   - Result: `"bcdf\nghjklm"` matches the output.
