The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` returns `True` if `x` is a power of `n` (i.e., $x = n^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$). The logic handles `n=1` separately (where `x` must be 1) and otherwise multiplies `power` (starting at 1) by `n` until it is greater than or equal to `x`.

To get an output of `True`, we need to provide values for `x` and `n` such that `x` is a power of `n`.
There are infinitely many solutions (e.g., `x=1, n=1` or `x=1, n=2` or `x=4, n=2`, etc.).
Let's select `n = 2` and `x = 8`.

**Simulation trace:**
1. Call `is_simple_power(8, 2)`.
2. Check `if n == 1`: `2 == 1` is `False`.
3. `power = 1`.
4. Loop `while power < x` (`1 < 8`):
   - `power = 1 * 2` (power becomes 2).
5. Loop `while power < x` (`2 < 8`):
   - `power = 2 * 2` (power becomes 4).
6. Loop `while power < x` (`4 < 8`):
   - `power = 4 * 2` (power becomes 8).
7. Loop `while power < x` (`8 < 8`):
   - Condition is `False`, loop terminates.
8. Check `return power == x`: `8 == 8` is `True`.
9. The function returns `True`.

[THOUGHT]
The function checks if `x` is a power of `n`. The output is given as `True`.
I need to find a pair `(x, n)` such that $x = n^k$ for some integer $k \ge 0$.
If I choose `n = 2`:
- $2^0 = 1$ (loop condition `1 < 1` fails, returns `1 == 1` -> True)
- $2^1 = 2$
- $2^2 = 4$
- $2^3 = 8$
Any of these `x` values with `n=2` would work.
I will verify with `x = 8` and `n = 2`.
1. `n` (2) != 1.
2. `power` starts at 1.
3. `1 < 8`, power becomes 2.
4. `2 < 8`, power becomes 4.
5. `4 < 8`, power becomes 8.
6. `8 < 8` is False. Loop ends.
7. Returns `8 == 8`, which is `True`.
This matches the expected output.
