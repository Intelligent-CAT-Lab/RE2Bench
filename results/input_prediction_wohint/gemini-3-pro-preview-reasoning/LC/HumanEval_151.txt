The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input. It computes the sum of squares of elements `i` within that list, provided they satisfy three conditions:
1. `i > 0` (Positive)
2. `i % 2 != 0` (Odd)
3. `'.' not in str(i)` (Integer-like, i.e., no decimal point)

The target output is `0`.
Since the term `i ** 2` for a real number is always non-negative, the sum can only be `0` if there are no terms to sum (the filtered list is empty).
For the filtered list to be empty, the input `lst` must either be empty or contain only numbers that are zero, negative, even, or floats with a decimal point.
The most minimal and standard input that yields a sum of `0` in such aggregation functions is an empty list `[]`.

[THOUGHT]
The function iterates over an input list `lst` and sums the squares of numbers that are positive, odd, and integers (judging by the string check for '.').
The output provided is `0`.
Since squares of real numbers are non-negative (`x^2 >= 0`), the sum is 0 only if the list of values being summed is empty.
This happens if `lst` contains no positive odd integers.
Possible inputs include `[]`, `[0]`, `[2]`, `[-5]`, `[3.5]`, etc.
Among these, the empty list `[]` is the simplest, canonical input that results in a zero sum for an aggregation function.
Verification:
Input: `[]`
Logic: `[i**2 for i in [] ...]` evaluates to `[]`. `sum([])` is `0`.
Matches output.
