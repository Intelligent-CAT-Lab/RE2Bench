The function `same_chars(s0, s1)` computes the set of unique characters for both input strings and checks if these sets are equal. 
The output provided is `True`. This implies that `set(s0)` must be equal to `set(s1)`. 
Therefore, the input strings `s0` and `s1` must contain exactly the same collection of unique characters, regardless of their order or frequency.
For example, if `s0` is "abc", its set is `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`. If `s1` is "cba", its set is also `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`. Since `{ 'a', 'b', 'c' } == { 'a', 'b', 'c' }`, the function returns `True`.

[THOUGHT]
The function checks if two strings share the exact same set of unique characters.
The desired output is `True`.
Condition: `set(s0) == set(s1)`.
I need to generate two strings `s0` and `s1` such that they are composed of the same characters.
An easy choice is to use two strings that are permutations of each other, or simply contain the same characters.
Let `s0 = "abc"`
Let `s1 = "cba"`
`set("abc")` is `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
`set("cba")` is `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
The sets are equal, satisfying the condition.
