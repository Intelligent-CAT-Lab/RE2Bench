[THOUGHT]
The function `f(values)` performs the following operations:
1.  Initializes a list `names` with `['Pete', 'Linda', 'Angela']`.
2.  Extends this list with the input `values`.
3.  Sorts the combined list alphabetically.
4.  Returns the sorted list.

The output provided is `['Angela', 'Dan', 'Dusty', 'Joe', 'Linda', 'Pete']`.

To determine the input `values`, we must compare the final output with the initial hardcoded list to see what was added.

-   Initial list: `['Pete', 'Linda', 'Angela']`
-   Final Output: `['Angela', 'Dan', 'Dusty', 'Joe', 'Linda', 'Pete']`

Intersecting the final output with the initial list:
-   'Angela' (Present in initial)
-   'Linda' (Present in initial)
-   'Pete' (Present in initial)

The remaining elements in the output must have come from the input `values`:
-   'Dan'
-   'Dusty'
-   'Joe'

Since the list is sorted at the end, the order of elements in the input `values` does not strictly matter to produce this output. We can assume the input was a list containing these three strings.

Therefore, `values` = `['Dan', 'Dusty', 'Joe']`.
