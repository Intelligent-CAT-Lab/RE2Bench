The function `is_palindrome` iterates through the provided string `text`. For each index `i`, it compares the character at the beginning (`text[i]`) with the corresponding character at the end (`text[len(text) - 1 - i]`). If these characters are not equal, the function returns `False`. If the loop finishes without mismatches, it returns `True`.

The expected output is `False`. This means the input string must not be a palindrome; it must have at least one position where the character does not match its mirror image.

Let's choose the string `"hello"`.
1. Length is 5.
2. Loop starts at `i = 0`.
3. Compare `text[0]` ('h') with `text[5 - 1 - 0]` which is `text[4]` ('o').
4. 'h' does not equal 'o'.
5. The function returns `False`.

This satisfies the condition.
