The execution of the `select` method generates an SQL query string based on the `fields` and `condition` provided, utilizing the `table_name` stored in the object instance.

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output string is `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`.
2.  **Determine `self` state**: The SQL structure is `SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name} ...`. By comparing this with the output part `FROM table1`, we can deduce that `self.table_name` must be `"table1"`.
3.  **Determine `fields`**: The query starts with `SELECT *`. Inside the method, if the input `fields` is `None`, it is set to `'*'`. If it were a list, it would be joined. `None` is the most direct value to produce `'*'` via the logic `if fields is None: fields = '*'`. Thus, `fields` is `None`.
4.  **Determine `condition`**: The query ends with `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20`. This section is added only if `condition` is not `None`. The code appends `f' WHERE {condition}'`. Therefore, the `condition` argument must be the string `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
