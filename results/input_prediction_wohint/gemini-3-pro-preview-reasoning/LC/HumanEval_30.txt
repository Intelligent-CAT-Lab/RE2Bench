The function `get_positive(l: list)` takes a list `l` and returns a new list containing only the elements that are strictly greater than 0.

The provided output is `[4, 5, 6]`.

To obtain this output:
1. The input list `l` must contain the numbers `4`, `5`, and `6`.
2. The order of these numbers in the input list must be preserved (4, then 5, then 6).
3. The input list could potentially contain other numbers less than or equal to 0 (e.g., -1, 0), as these would be filtered out by the condition `if e > 0`.
4. Since we cannot determine if any specific non-positive numbers were originally present and removed, the most direct and minimal valid input is the list `[4, 5, 6]` itself.

Therefore, a valid input is `l = [4, 5, 6]`.
