The function `rescale_to_unit` performs Min-Max normalization on a list of numbers. It transforms each number $x$ in the list using the formula:
$$ \text{normalized\_x} = \frac{x - \min(\text{numbers})}{\max(\text{numbers}) - \min(\text{numbers})} $$
The function returns a list of these normalized values.

The provided output is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

From the definition of the function:
1.  The value corresponding to `0.0` is the minimum of the input list.
2.  The value corresponding to `1.0` is the maximum of the input list.
3.  The output values are equally spaced with a step of $0.25$. This implies that the input values form an arithmetic progression.

Let the input list be $X$.
Let $x_{\min} = \min(X)$ and $R = \max(X) - \min(X)$ be the range.
The relationship is $x_i = x_{\min} + \text{output}_i \times R$.
Since the output steps are $0.25 = \frac{1}{4}$, to result in integer inputs (which is the most likely scenario for a test case), the range $R$ should be a multiple of 4.
The smallest positive integer multiple of 4 is 4.
If we assume the range $R = 4$ and the minimum value $x_{\min} = 0$ (the simplest base case):
-   $x_1 = 0 + 0.0 \times 4 = 0$
-   $x_2 = 0 + 0.25 \times 4 = 1$
-   $x_3 = 0 + 0.5 \times 4 = 2$
-   $x_4 = 0 + 0.75 \times 4 = 3$
-   $x_5 = 0 + 1.0 \times 4 = 4$

This yields the input list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
Verifying: $\min=0, \max=4$.
Normalization: $(0-0)/4 = 0.0, (1-0)/4 = 0.25, \dots, (4-0)/4 = 1.0$.
This matches the output exactly. While there are infinite valid inputs (e.g., `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]` or `[0.0, 0.25, ...]`), `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is the standard minimal integer sequence that produces this result.
