The code reads an integer `N`.
There are two possible execution paths:
1. If `N` is even (`N % 2 == 0`), it prints `0.5`.
2. If `N` is odd, it prints the result of `(N + 1) / N / 2`.

The provided output is `0.5050505050505051`.
Since `0.5050505050505051` is not `0.5`, the code must have entered the `else` block. Therefore, `N` is odd.
We can set up the equation based on the code's formula:
$$ \frac{N + 1}{2N} \approx 0.5050505050505051 $$

This can be rewritten as:
$$ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2N} \approx 0.5050505050505051 $$
$$ 0.5 + \frac{1}{2N} \approx 0.5050505050505051 $$
$$ \frac{1}{2N} \approx 0.0050505050505051 $$
$$ 2N \approx \frac{1}{0.0050505050505051} $$

Calculation:
$$ \frac{1}{0.0050505050505051} \approx 197.999... \approx 198 $$

So, $2N = 198$, which implies $N = 99$.
Let's verify with $N = 99$:
$N$ is 99 (odd), so the `else` block executes.
The expression is `(99 + 1) / 99 / 2` equal to `100 / 198` equal to `50 / 99`.
Performing the division `50 / 99` results in approximately `0.505050505...`.
In standard double-precision floating-point arithmetic (used by Python), `50/99` is represented as `0.5050505050505051`.
This matches the output exactly.
