[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers `t` and `h`.
Then it prints the result of the expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.

Given the output is `2`, we have the equation:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = 2`

Solving for the integer division term:
`(h - 2) // (t - 1) = 1`

For integer division `A // B` to equal `1`, the condition `1 * B <= A < 2 * B` must hold (assuming B > 0).
Here `A = h - 2` and `B = t - 1`. Since `t` denotes a count (likely from a competitive programming context) and acts as a divisor, we assume `t > 1` so `B > 0`.

Substituting A and B into the inequality:
`(t - 1) <= h - 2 < 2 * (t - 1)`

splitting this into two parts:
1. `t - 1 <= h - 2`  =>  `t + 1 <= h`
2. `h - 2 < 2t - 2`  =>  `h < 2t`

So we need to find two integers `t` and `h` such that `t + 1 <= h < 2t`.

Let's choose a simple value for `t`.
If `t = 2`:
Lower bound: `2 + 1 <= h` => `3 <= h`
Upper bound: `h < 2 * 2` => `h < 4`
So `h` can be `3`.
Input pair: `2 3`.

Verification:
`t = 2`, `h = 3`
Expression: `(3 - 2) // (2 - 1) + 1`
`= 1 // 1 + 1`
`= 1 + 1`
`= 2`.
This matches the output.

If we tried `t = 3`:
`4 <= h < 6`. `h` could be 4 or 5.
Verification for `3 5`: `(5 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1` = `3 // 2 + 1` = `1 + 1` = `2`.

I will provide the simplest solution found: `2 3`.
