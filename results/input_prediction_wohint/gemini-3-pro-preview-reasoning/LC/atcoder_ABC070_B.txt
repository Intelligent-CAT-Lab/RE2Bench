The code reads four integers $a, b, c, d$ from the input. It then computes the length of the intersection of two intervals $[a, b)$ and $[c, d)$ (or simply calculates `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))`).
The expression `min(b, d) - max(a, c)` represents the mathematical calculation: (smaller of the end points) - (larger of the start points).
If the result is positive, it represents the overlap length. If it is negative or zero, it means the intervals do not overlap (or are invalid/empty), and the `max(0, ...)` ensures the output is 0.

Given the output is `0`, we need to provide four integers such that `min(b, d) <= max(a, c)`.

Let's pick two disjoint intervals, for example:
Interval 1: 0 to 1 ($a=0, b=1$)
Interval 2: 2 to 3 ($c=2, d=3$)

Let's plug these values into the logic:
1. $a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3$
2. `max(a, c)` = `max(0, 2)` = 2
3. `min(b, d)` = `min(1, 3)` = 1
4. `min(b, d) - max(a, c)` = $1 - 2 = -1$
5. `max(0, -1)` = 0

The output is 0, which matches the required output.
