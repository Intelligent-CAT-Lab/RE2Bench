[THOUGHT]
The function `add_event` takes an argument `event` and appends it to the instance attribute `self.events`.
The function does not have a `return` statement, which implies it returns `None` (represented as `null` in the JSON output).
Since the output is `null` regardless of the input contents, there is no way to reverse-engineer the exact specific values used in the function call from the output alone.
However, to provide a valid input structure, I need to construct a reasonable state for the object and a valid argument.
1. `self`: An instance of `CalendarUtil`. Conventionally, it starts with an empty list of events. `{"events": []}`.
2. `args`: Contains the `event` to be added. A dictionary is a typical representation for a calendar event. Example: `{"title": "Weekly Sync", "time": "10:00"}`.
The execution flow is: append input to list -> return None.
