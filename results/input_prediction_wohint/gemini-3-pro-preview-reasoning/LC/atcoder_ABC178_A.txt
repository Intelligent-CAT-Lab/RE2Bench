[THOUGHT]
The code snippet takes an integer input `x`.
It checks if `x` is equal to 1.
If `x == 1`, it prints `0`.
Otherwise, it prints `1`.
The provided output is `0`.
For the code to print `0`, the condition `x == 1` must be true.
Therefore, `x` must be 1.
This means the input provided to the program was "1".
