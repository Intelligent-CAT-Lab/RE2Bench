[THOUGHT]
The code snippet takes two integers, `h` and `a`, as input from a single line, separated by a space.
It calculates the ceiling of the division `h / a` using `math.ceil` and prints the result.
The provided output is `6`.
So, the equation to solve is `math.ceil(h / a) == 6`.
This effectively means that the value of `h / a` must be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6 ($5 < h/a \le 6$).

We can choose arbitrary integer values for `h` and `a` that satisfy this condition.
Case 1: Let $a = 1$. Then $5 < h \le 6$, so $h = 6$. Input could be `6 1`.
Case 2: Let $a = 2$. Then $5 < h/2 \le 6 \Rightarrow 10 < h \le 12$. So $h$ can be 11 or 12. Input could be `11 2`.
Case 3: Let $a = 5$. Then $25 < h \le 30$. $h$ could be 27. Input `27 5` ($27/5 = 5.4$, ceil is 6).

Any of these pairs would result in the output 6. I will select `h=11` and `a=2`.
Calculation check: $11 / 2 = 5.5$. `math.ceil(5.5)` is 6.
