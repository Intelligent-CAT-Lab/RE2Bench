The function `extract_all` is designed to open a zip file specified by the instance variable `self.file_name` and extract its contents to `output_path`. The return value is `False`, which implies that the code execution entered the `except` block. This happens if an exception is raised within the `try` block. Common reasons for such an exception include the file defined by `self.file_name` not existing (`FileNotFoundError`) or not being a valid zip file (`zipfile.BadZipFile`). Since the specific string values cannot be reverse-engineered solely from the boolean return value, valid inputs would be any that trigger an error. I will assume a scenario where the file provided does not exist.
