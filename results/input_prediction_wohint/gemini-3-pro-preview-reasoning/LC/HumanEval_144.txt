The code defines a function `simplify(x, n)` which takes two parameters.
1.  **Parsing**: It expects both `x` and `n` to be strings representing fractions in the format `"numerator/denominator"`.
    *   `x` is split into `a` and `b`.
    *   `n` is split into `c` and `d`.
2.  **Calculation**: It calculates the product of the two fractions.
    *   `numerator` = `int(a)` * `int(c)`
    *   `denom` = `int(b)` * `int(d)`
3.  **Result**: It returns `True` if the resulting fraction (`numerator / denom`) simplifies to a whole integer (i.e. `numerator` is evenly divisible by `denom`), and `False` otherwise.

Given the output is `True`, we need to provide input strings `x` and `n` such that their product is an integer.

Arbitrary selection:
*   Let `x` = `"1/2"` (so $a=1, b=2$)
*   Let `n` = `"2/1"` (so $c=2, d=1$)
*   Calculation:
    *   `numerator` = $1 * 2 = 2$
    *   `denom` = $2 * 1 = 2$
    *   $2 / 2 = 1.0$
    *   $int(1.0) = 1$
    *   $1.0 == 1$ is `True`.
