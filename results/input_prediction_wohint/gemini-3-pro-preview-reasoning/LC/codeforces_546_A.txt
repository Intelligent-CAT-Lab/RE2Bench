The Python code reads three integers `k`, `n`, and `w` from a single line of input.
It calculates a cumulative sum: `sum = k*1 + k*2 + ... + k*w`.
Mathematically, this sum is equal to `k * w * (w + 1) / 2`.
The code then checks if this calculated `sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
If `sum <= n`, it prints `0`.
Otherwise, it prints `sum - n`.

The desired output is `0`.
Therefore, we need to find input values for `k`, `n`, and `w` such that the condition `sum <= n` is true.

Let's try to construct a valid input:
1. Choose small positive integers for `k` and `w` to calculate the cost.
   Let `k = 3`.
   Let `w = 2`.
2. Calculate `sum`:
   Iteration 1 (i=1): `sum += 3 * 1` -> `sum = 3`
   Iteration 2 (i=2): `sum += 3 * 2` -> `sum = 3 + 6 = 9`
   Total `sum` = 9.
3. Choose `n` such that `9 <= n`.
   Let `n = 10`.

So, the input values are `k=3, n=10, w=2`.
The input string format is "k n w", so "3 10 2".

Let's verify:
Input: "3 10 2"
- `k` = 3, `n` = 10, `w` = 2
- Loop runs for i=1 and i=2.
- `sum` becomes 9.
- Check `if 9 <= 10`: This is True.
- Print `0`.
The output matches the target.
