The python code executes a loop 10 times, updating the value of `x` based on the formula `x = r * x - D` and printing `x` at each step.
We are given the sequence of printed values: `110, 120, 140, 180, 260, 420, 740, 1380, 2660, 5220`.

Let $x_0$ be the initial input value of `x`.
Let $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{10}$ be the printed output values.

From the code logic, we have the recurrence relation:
$x_n = r \cdot x_{n-1} - D$

We can write equations for the first few output values to solve for `r` and `D`. Note that $x_1$ corresponds to the value of `x` after the first iteration, so it depends on the input `x` ($x_0$).
1. $x_2 = r \cdot x_1 - D$
2. $x_3 = r \cdot x_2 - D$

Substituting the known output values ($x_1 = 110$, $x_2 = 120$, $x_3 = 140$):
1. $120 = r \cdot 110 - D$
2. $140 = r \cdot 120 - D$

We have a system of two linear equations with two variables ($r$ and $D$).
Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
$(140 - 120) = (r \cdot 120 - D) - (r \cdot 110 - D)$
$20 = 120r - 110r$
$20 = 10r$
$r = 2$

Now substitute $r = 2$ back into equation (1) to find $D$:
$120 = 2 \cdot 110 - D$
$120 = 220 - D$
$D = 220 - 120$
$D = 100$

Now that we have `r` and `D`, we can verify them with the next term in the sequence ($x_4 = 180$):
$x_4 = r \cdot x_3 - D$
$180 = 2 \cdot 140 - 100$
$180 = 280 - 100$
$180 = 180$ (Correct)

Finally, we need to find the initial input value `x` ($x_0$). Use the relation for the first iteration:
$x_1 = r \cdot x_0 - D$
$110 = 2 \cdot x_0 - 100$
$210 = 2 \cdot x_0$
$x_0 = 105$

So the inputs must be:
$r = 2$
$D = 100$
$x = 105$

The Python code reads these as a single line separated by spaces: `r, D, x`.
Input string: `2 100 105`
