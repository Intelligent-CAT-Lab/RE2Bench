To predict the input, we need to analyze the conditions required for the Python code to print "YES".

1.  **Code Analysis**:
    *   `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`: Can receive any number of integers separated by spaces.
    *   The outer condition `if ABC.count(5) == 2:` requires that the integer `5` appears exactly twice in the input.
    *   The inner condition is a conditional print: `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')`. To print "YES", the sum of all integers in the tuple `ABC` must be exactly `17`.

2.  **Constraint Solving**:
    *   We know `ABC` contains two `5`s.
    *   Let the elements of `ABC` be $\{5, 5, x_1, x_2, ...\}$.
    *   The sum of the two `5`s is $5 + 5 = 10$.
    *   The total sum must be 17.
    *   Therefore, the sum of the remaining numbers must be $17 - 10 = 7$.
    *   Also, none of the remaining numbers can be `5` (otherwise the count would be greater than 2).

3.  **Constructing an Input**:
    *   The simplest way to satisfy the remaining sum of 7 is to use the integer `7` itself.
    *   We check if `7` is equal to `5`. It is not, so the count remains 2.
    *   Resulting numbers: `5, 5, 7`.
    *   Verification:
        *   Count of 5 is 2? Yes.
        *   Sum is $5 + 5 + 7 = 17$? Yes.
    *   Input string format: "5 5 7".
