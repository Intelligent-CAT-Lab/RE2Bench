[THOUGHT]
The function `template_changed` returns `True` (based on the provided output) when:
1. The `file_path` provided has a suffix other than `.py`.
2. The `file_path` is located within one of the directories returned by `get_template_directories()`.

The `get_template_directories()` function gathers template directories from configured Django engines. It uses `Path.cwd()` and resolves directories defined in settings (like `DIRS` or app directories).

To replicate the output `True`, we need to simulate an input `file_path` that:
1. Is a `pathlib.Path` object (represented here as a string path in JSON).
2. Has a non-Python extension (e.g., `.html`).
3. Is a child of a directory that `get_reason_directories` would likely return. Assuming a standard project structure where `cwd` is the project root and there is a `templates` directory configured, a path like `/app/templates/index.html` (assuming `/app/templates` is a template dir) meets the criteria.
   - `file_path.suffix` is `.html`.
   - `file_path.parents` includes `/app/templates`.
   - If `get_template_directories()` returns `/app/templates`, the condition `template_dir in file_path.parents` evaluates to True.

The `sender` argument is required by the function signature but not used in the logic, so `null` (None) is an appropriate value. `kwargs` is also unused.

Therefore, valid input arguments are a `sender` of `None` and a `file_path` pointing to a file inside a template directory.
