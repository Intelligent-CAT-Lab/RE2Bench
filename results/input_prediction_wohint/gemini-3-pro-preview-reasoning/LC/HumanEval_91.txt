The function `is_bored(S)` splits the input string `S` into sentences using the regex `[.?!]\s*` and counts how many sentences start with `"I "`.

The target output is `0`. This means we need to provide an input string `S` such that none of the sentences derived from it start with `"I "`.

[THOUGHT]
The function splits the text by sentence delimiters.
To get a result of 0, `sum` must be 0.
This implies `sentence[0:2] == 'I '` must be false for every sentence in the split list.
If I provide the string `"Hello world"`, the regex split will result in `['Hello world']`.
The first two characters are `"He"`, which is not equal to `"I "`.
Thus, the sum will be 0.
Another option is an empty string, or a string like `"It is fine."` which starts with "It" not "I ".
I will choose `S = "Hello world"` as a simple valid input.
