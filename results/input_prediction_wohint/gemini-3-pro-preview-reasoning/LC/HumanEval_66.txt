The function `digitSum` takes a string `s` as input. It iterates through each character of the string. If a character is an uppercase letter, it adds its ASCII value (`ord(char)`) to a running total. If the character is not uppercase, it adds 0. Finally, it returns the total sum.

Given the output is **327**, we need to find a string `s` such that the sum of the ASCII values of its uppercase characters is 327.

The ASCII values for uppercase English letters range from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z').
We can estimate the number of uppercase characters required:
- Minimum characters: $\lceil 327 / 90 \rceil = 4$
- Maximum characters: $\lfloor 327 / 65 \rfloor = 5$

Let's try to construct a string using 5 characters, starting with the smallest value 'A' (65).
Sum of 5 'A's: $65 \times 5 = 325$.
This is very close to 327. We need to add 2 to the sum.
We can distribute this difference of 2 by increasing the ASCII value of some characters:
- Option 1: Change one 'A' (65) to 'C' (67) -> $65+65+65+65+67 = 327$. String: "AAAAC".
- Option 2: Change two 'A's (65) to 'B's (66) -> $65+66+65+66+65 = 327$. String: "ABABA".

Let's verify "ABABA":
- 'A': 65
- 'B': 66
- 'A': 65
- 'B': 66
- 'A': 65
Sum: $65 + 66 + 65 + 66 + 65 = 327$.

The calculation is correct. "ABABA" is a valid input.

[THOUGHT]
The function `digitSum` calculates the sum of ASCII values for all uppercase characters in the input string `s`.
Target output is 327.
I need to find a combination of uppercase letters whose ASCII values sum to 327.
Range of ASCII for 'A'-'Z' is 65-90.
Is it possible with 3 chars? Max $90 \times 3 = 270$. No.
Is it possible with 4 chars? Min $65 \times 4 = 260$, Max $90 \times 4 = 360$. Yes.
Is it possible with 5 chars? Min $65 \times 5 = 325$, Max $90 \times 5 = 450$. Yes.

Let's try a 5-character string composed mostly of 'A' (65).
$5 \times 65 = 325$.
We need 2 more to reach 327.
We can add 1 to two characters to make them 'B' (66).
Sequence: 65 ('A'), 66 ('B'), 65 ('A'), 66 ('B'), 65 ('A').
Sum = $65 + 66 + 65 + 66 + 65 = 327$.
The string "ABABA" works.
Other options like "QQQT" ($81 \times 3 + 84 = 327$) also work, but "ABABA" is a simple palindrome.

Input structure matches the provided example: an object with `args` mapping the parameter name `s` to the value.
