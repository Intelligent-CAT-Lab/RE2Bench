The code snippet initializes `n` from the input.
Then it initializes `i` to 1 and `j` to `n * n`.
Inside the `while` loop, it prints `i` and `j` as long as `i < j`.

Looking at the first line of the output: `"1 64"`.
In the first iteration of the loop, `i` is 1 (as initialized).
Therefore, the second number printed, which corresponds to variable `j`, must be the initial value of `j`.
The code sets `j = n * n`.
So, `n * n = 64`.

Solving for `n`:
`n = sqrt(64)`
`n = 8`

Let's verify this with the rest of the output loop.
If `n = 8`, `j` starts at 64.
1. `i=1, j=64`. Output: `1 64`. Update: `i=2, j=63`. Check `2 < 63` (True).
2. `i=2, j=63`. Output: `2 63`. ...
...
The sum `i + j` remains constant at $1 + 64 = 65$.
Let's look at the last line of the output: `"32 33"`.
Here `i=32, j=33`. `32 + 33 = 65`. This matches the invariant.
After printing `32 33`, `i` becomes 33 and `j` becomes 32.
The condition `i < j` (33 < 32) becomes False, and the loop terminates.
This matches the provided output exactly.

Therefore, the input `n` is 8.
