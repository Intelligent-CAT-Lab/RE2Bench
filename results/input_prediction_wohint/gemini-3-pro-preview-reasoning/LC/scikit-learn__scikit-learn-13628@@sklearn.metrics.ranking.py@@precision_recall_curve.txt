The analysis steps to confirm the input values are as follows:

1.  **Analyze the Output**: The output consists of three arrays corresponding to `precision`, `recall`, and `thresholds` returned by `precision_recall_curve`.
    *   `precision`: `[1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]`
    *   `recall`: `[1., 0.85714286, 0.57142857, 0.28571429, 0.]`
    *   `thresholds`: `[0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1. ]`

2.  **Determine Label Counts**:
    *   Since `precision` is `1.0` for all thresholds, there are **no false positives** (negative samples) with scores greater than or equal to the lowest threshold ($0.5$).
    *   We can infer the total number of positive samples (Total Positives, $P$) from the recall values. Recall is defined as $TP / P$.
    *   The recall values are fractions. Looking at the values: $0.2857 \approx 2/7$, $0.5714 \approx 4/7$, $0.8571 \approx 6/7$, $1.0 = 7/7$. This suggests the total number of positive samples $P = 7$.

3.  **Map Thresholds and Counts**:
    *   The function processes scores in descending order. The `thresholds` output is sorted ascendingly.
    *   **Threshold 1.0**: Recall is $2/7$. This means 2 positive samples have a score $\ge 1.0$.
    *   **Threshold 0.9**: Recall is $4/7$. This means 4 positive samples have a score $\ge 0.9$. Since 2 were at 1.0, we have $4 - 2 = 2$ samples at score 0.9.
    *   **Threshold 0.6**: Recall is $6/7$. This means 6 positive samples have a score $\ge 0.6$. New samples: $6 - 4 = 2$ samples at score 0.6.
    *   **Threshold 0.5**: Recall is $7/7$. This means 7 positive samples have a score $\ge 0.5$. New samples: $7 - 6 = 1$ sample at score 0.5.

4.  **Reconstruct Probabilities**:
    *   Based on the counts: `[1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5]`.

5.  **Reconstruct True Labels (`y_true`)**:
    *   Since precision is always 1, all samples with these scores must be Positive (1).
    *   Samples with scores $< 0.5$ (if any) are not captured in the thresholds because `tps` reaches the maximum (7) at threshold 0.5, and the function cuts off lower thresholds. For a minimal input prediction, we assume no other samples exist.
    *   `y_true`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

6.  **Formatting**:
    *   The input arguments are `y_true` and `probas_pred`.
