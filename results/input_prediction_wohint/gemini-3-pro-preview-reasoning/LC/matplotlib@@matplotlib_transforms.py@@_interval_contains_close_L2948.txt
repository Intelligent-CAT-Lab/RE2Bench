The function `_interval_contains_close` determines if a value `val` lies within a given `interval` `(a, b)`, allowing for a small relative tolerance.
The steps of execution are:
1. Unpack `interval` into `a` and `b`.
2. Ensure `a <= b` by swapping if necessary.
3. Calculate the tolerance `rtol` as `(b - a) * rtol` (default `rtol` is `1e-10`).
4. Check if `val` is between `a - rtol` and `b + rtol` inclusive.
5. Return the boolean result.

The target output is `np.True_`, which corresponds to a logical `True`.
To achieve this result, I need to provide inputs where `val` is inside `interval`.

Reference inputs:
- Let `interval` be `[0, 10]`.
- With `a=0`, `b=10`, the width is 10.
- The relative tolerance calculation: `rtol = 10 * 1e-10 = 1e-9`.
- The valid range for `val` becomes `[-1e-9, 10.000000001]`.
- Choosing `val = 5` places it exactly in the middle of the interval, which satisfies the condition `0 - 1e-9 <= 5 <= 10 + 1e-9`.
- This ensures the function returns `True`.

I will construct the input JSON with these values. Since the example output indicates a numpy scalar type for the boolean (`np.True_`), it's likely the original trace involved numpy types, but standard JSON inputs (ints/floats) are sufficient to deduce the variable values that satisfy the logic. I will format the input as a dictionary of the arguments.
