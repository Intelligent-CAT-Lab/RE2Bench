The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string created by joining numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) with spaces.

1.  **Analyze the output**: The output string is `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
2.  **Analyze the code logic**: The code executes `' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])`.
3.  **Determine the range**: The string contains numbers starting from 0 up to 10. The `range(k)` function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to `k-1`. Since the last number in the string is 10, the range used must have been `range(11)`.
4.  **Solve for input**: The code uses `range(n + 1)`. Since the effective range is `range(11)`, we have `n + 1 = 11`. Therefore, `n = 10`.
