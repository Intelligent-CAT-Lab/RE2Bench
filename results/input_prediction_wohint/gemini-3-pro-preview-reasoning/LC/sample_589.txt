The function `f(num)` takes a list `num` as input. It appends the last element of the list (`num[-1]`) to the end of the list and returns the modified list.

To find the input, we need to reverse this operation:
1. The output list is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
2. The last element `1` was added by the function.
3. This element was added because it was equal to the last element of the original list.
4. If we remove the last element from the output list, we get the state of the list before the `append` operation.
5. Removing the last `1` from `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` results in `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`.
6. Let's verify: If input is `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`, `num[-1]` is `1`. Appending `1` gives `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`. This matches the output.
