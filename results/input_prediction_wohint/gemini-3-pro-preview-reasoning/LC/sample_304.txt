The function identifies the two largest keys in the input dictionary `d`, removes them, and returns a new dictionary containing just those two entries. Since the output is `{"87": 7, "18": 6}` and "87" is "greater" than "18", these represent the first and second items extracted. Therefore, the input dictionary `d` must have contained these specific key-value pairs.
