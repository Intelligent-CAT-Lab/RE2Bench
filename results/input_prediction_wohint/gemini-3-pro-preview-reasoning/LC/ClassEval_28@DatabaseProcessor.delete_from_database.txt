The function `delete_from_database` connects to a SQLite database, constructs a generic SQL DELETE query using the provided `table_name`, executes it to delete rows where the `name` column matches the provided `name` argument, and finally commits and closes the connection. The function does not explicitly return a value, which implies it returns `None` (represented as `null` in JSON Output).

Since the output is `null` regardless of the specific input values (assuming no exceptions are raised), the exact input values cannot be reverse-engineered deterministically from the output alone. However, we can construct a syntactically valid and realistic set of inputs that would produce this output.

1.  **Initialize**: `DatabaseProcessor` is initialized with a `database_name`. A reasonable placeholder is `"test.db"`.
    *   `self.database_name`: `"test.db"`
2.  **Method Call**: `delete_from_database` is called with `table_name` and `name`.
    *   `table_name`: A typical valid SQL table name, e.g., `"users"`.
    *   `name`: A value to identify the row to delete, e.g., `"John"`.
3.  **Execution Simulation**:
    *   Connect to `test.db`.
    *   Query becomes: `DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ?`.
    *   Execute query with parameter `('John', )`.
    *   Commit and Close.
    *   Return `None`.
