[THOUGHT]
The method `clean_non_binary_chars` takes no arguments other than `self`. It accesses the instance attribute `self.binary_string`, filters it to retain only characters '0' and '1', updates the attribute in-place, and returns `None` (implicitly). The provided output is `null`, which corresponds to `None` in Python. Since the return value defines no specific data constraints on the input string (other than it being iterable, preferably a string), and the side effect (the modified string) is not shown in the output, we can construct a plausible input state. A logical input would be a `self` object where `binary_string` contains both binary and non-binary characters to demonstrate the cleaning functionality, or simply a binary string. I will assume a mixed string like `"012345"` to illustrate the logic.
