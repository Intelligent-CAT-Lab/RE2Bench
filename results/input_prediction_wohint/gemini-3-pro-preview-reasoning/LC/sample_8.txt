The function `f` takes a `string` and an `encryption` flag.
Inside the function:
1. If `encryption == 0`, it returns the `string` as is.
2. Otherwise, it converts the string to uppercase using `.upper()` and then encodes it using 'rot13'.

The provided output is `"UppEr"`.
Let's analyze the `else` branch (when `encryption != 0`):
- The input string is first converted to uppercase (`.upper()`). This results in a string consisting entirely of uppercase characters (and non-alphabetic characters).
- Then `'rot13'` encoding is applied. ROT13 rotates letters but preserves their case (or rather, maps uppercase to uppercase).
- Consequently, the output of the `else` branch must be an all-uppercase string.
- The output `"UppEr"` contains lowercase letters ('p', 'r').
- Therefore, the output could not have been produced by the `else` branch.

This leaves the first branch:
- Condition: `encryption == 0`.
- Result: `return string`.
- For the returned value to be `"UppEr"`, the input `string` must be `"UppEr"`.

Thus, the inputs are `string = "UppEr"` and `encryption = 0`.
