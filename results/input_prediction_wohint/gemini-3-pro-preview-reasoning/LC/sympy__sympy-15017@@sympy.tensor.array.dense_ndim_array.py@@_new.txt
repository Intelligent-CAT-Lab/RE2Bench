[THOUGHT]
The user wants to find the input arguments for the `_new` class method of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`.
The method signature is `def _new(cls, iterable, shape, **kwargs)`.
The method returns an instance `self` with initialized attributes.
The provided output describes the state of this returned object:
- `_rank`: 2. This implies `len(shape)` is 2.
- `_loop_size`: "4". This implies the product of elements in `shape` is 4. The string type suggests the value is a SymPy Integer (which serializes to a string in this context), which is consistent with the code mapping shape elements to SymPy objects.
- `_shape`: `{}`. This is likely a placeholder for a SymPy Tuple object that failed to serialize meaningfully to JSON, or is just represented as such. It corresponds to the shape tuple.
- `_array`: `null`. This corresponds to `self._array`. The code sets `self._array = list(flat_list)`. Since it is `null` in the output, it suggests the list contains objects (likely SymPy Integers) that the serializer treated as null or omitted. This prevents determining the exact element values, but implies we should provide a valid iterable of size 4.

Deducing the inputs:
1.  **Shape**: We need a shape with length (`_rank`) 2 and product of elements (`_loop_size`) 4. Possible integer shapes are `(1, 4)`, `(2, 2)`, or `(4, 1)`. The shape `(2, 2)` is the most standard representation for a rank-2 array of size 4. I will assume `shape=[2, 2]`.
2.  **Iterable**: We need an iterable that yields 4 elements to match the shape size. Since the content is `null` in output, the specific values don't determine the structure, but `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is a standard test input. The code `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` and flattening logic will convert this to the internal list.

Therefore, the inputs are `iterable=[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `shape=[2, 2]`.
