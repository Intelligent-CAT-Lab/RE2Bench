To predict the input of `__pow__`, I need to analyze the provided output. The output shows that `_array_form` is `null` and `_size` is `7`. 

The `__pow__` method is part of the `Permutation` class, and it raises a `NotImplementedError` if the exponent is another `Permutation`. However, the error message also suggests that the user might have intended `p^p` as a conjugate operation, but that's not relevant here.

The key information here is that `_array_form` is `null`, which suggests that the permutation's array form hasn't been initialized yet. The `_size` being `7` indicates that the permutation is of size 7.

To determine the input, I need to figure out what values would lead to this state after the `__pow__` method is called. The `__pow__` method takes an integer exponent `n` and returns a new permutation by raising the current permutation to the power of `n`.

Given that `_array_form` is `null`, it's likely that the permutation was just created and hasn't had its array form computed yet. The `_size` being `7` suggests that the permutation is of size 7.

The most plausible scenario is that the input to `__pow__` is a permutation of size 7 raised to the power of 1, since any permutation raised to the power of 1 is itself. However, since `_array_form` is `null`, it's possible that the permutation was created but not yet initialized.

Therefore, the input to `__pow__` is likely a permutation of size 7 raised to the power of 1.
