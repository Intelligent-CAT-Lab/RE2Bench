Let's analyze the code step by step.

The input consists of four integers: anti, b, c, d. These are assigned to variables anti, b, c, d respectively.

The code then calculates the absolute differences between anti and c (l = abs(anti - c)), and between b and d (m = abs(b - d)).

The code then checks several conditions:
1. If anti == c: It prints anti + m, b, c + m, d.
2. Else if b == d: It prints anti, b + l, c, d + l.
3. Else if l != m: It prints -1.
4. Else: It prints anti, d, c, b.

Given the output "3 8 7 4", let's determine which condition was met and find the corresponding input values.

Looking at the output "3 8 7 4", it seems like the fourth condition (else) was met, where the code prints anti, d, c, b. This implies that anti = 3, d = 8, c = 7, and b = 4.

However, to verify this, let's check if the other conditions could have led to this output.

If the first condition (anti == c) was met, the output would have been anti + m, b, c + m, d. For this to result in "3 8 7 4", we would need anti + m = 3, c + m = 7, which implies m = 0 and anti = c = 3, but then b and d would need to be 8 and 4 respectively, leading to a different output for the first condition.

If the second condition (b == d) was met, the output would have been anti, b + l, c, d + l. For this to result in "3 8 7 4", we would need b + l = 8 and d + l = 4, which is impossible since l is a non-negative integer and b == d.

If the third condition (l != m) was met, the output would have been -1, which does not match the given output.

Therefore, the fourth condition must have been met, and the input values must be anti = 3, b = 4, c = 7, d = 8.

Let's verify this:

l = abs(3 - 7) = 4
m = abs(4 - 8) = 4
Since l == m, the fourth condition is met, and the output is anti, d, c, b = 3, 8, 7, 4, which matches the given output.
