Let's think step by step:

The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` and returns the sum of the squares of the elements that meet certain conditions. The conditions are:

1. The element `i` must be greater than 0.
2. The element `i` must be an odd number (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`).
3. The element `i` must not be a floating-point number (i.e., `'.' not in str(i)`).

The output is 0, which means that there are no elements in the input list that meet all the conditions above.

Now, we need to find an input list that would result in this output. Let's consider some possible scenarios:

- An empty list: This would trivially result in a sum of 0, but let's see if there are other possibilities.
- A list with only even numbers: Since the condition requires odd numbers, this would also result in a sum of 0.
- A list with only non-positive numbers: Since the condition requires positive numbers, this would also result in a sum of 0.
- A list with only floating-point numbers: Since the condition requires integers (i.e., no decimal point), this would also result in a sum of 0.

Any of these scenarios would result in the output 0. Let's choose one of them as the input. For simplicity, let's choose an empty list.
