Let's analyze the output of the `compare` function to determine the possible input values for `game` and `guess`.

The output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`, which is a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.

Assuming `game` and `guess` are lists of integers of the same length (likely 4, given the output has 4 elements), let's denote the elements of `game` as `g1, g2, g3, g4` and the elements of `guess` as `x1, x2, x3, x4`.

We have the following equations based on the absolute differences:
1. `|g1 - x1| = 2`
2. `|g2 - x2| = 0`
3. `|g3 - x3| = 0`
4. `|g4 - x4| = 1`

From equations 2 and 3, since the absolute difference is 0, it means `g2 = x2` and `g3 = x3`.

Let's consider possible values for `g1, x1, g4, x4` that satisfy equations 1 and 4.

For equation 1 (`|g1 - x1| = 2`):
- Possible pairs: (g1, x1) could be (0, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4), etc.

For equation 4 (`|g4 - x4| = 1`):
- Possible pairs: (g4, x4) could be (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (3, 4), etc.

However, without more constraints, there are multiple possible combinations. Let's choose a simple and logical example where `game` and `guess` are close in value but differ by the required amounts.

Let's assume:
- `g1 = 3`, `x1 = 1` (difference 2)
- `g2 = 5`, `x2 = 5` (difference 0)
- `g3 = 7`, `x3 = 7` (difference 0)
- `g4 = 4`, `x4 = 3` (difference 1)

This gives us `game = [3, 5, 7, 4]` and `guess = [1, 5, 7, 3]`.

Let's verify:
- `|3 - 1| = 2`
- `|5 - 5| = 0`
- `|7 - 7| = 0`
- `|4 - 3| = 1`

This matches the output `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.
