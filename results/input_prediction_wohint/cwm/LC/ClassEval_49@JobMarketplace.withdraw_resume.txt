<think>
We have a class JobMarketplace with a method withdraw_resume that removes a resume from the list of resumes. The output of the method is null, which means the method executed successfully without returning any value.

To predict the input, we need to consider what kind of resume object would be passed to the withdraw_resume method. Since the method removes the resume from the list, the resume object must already be present in the list of resumes.

Let's assume the resume object has some attributes like name, skills, and experience. For example, a resume object could be {"name": "John Doe", "skills": ["Python", "Java"], "experience": 5}.

So, the input to the withdraw_resume method would be this resume object.
