To find the input for `TR111`, I need to reverse-engineer the transformation that occurred. The output `cos(phi)**2` suggests that the input might involve `sec(phi)**(-2)` since the function `TR111` is designed to convert trigonometric functions raised to negative powers into their reciprocals raised to positive powers. 

Let's break down the possible steps:

1. The function `TR111` applies a transformation `f` bottom-up to the input expression `rv`.
2. The transformation `f` checks if `rv` is a `Pow` (power) instance with a positive base or a negative integer exponent.
3. For `cos`, it converts `cos(x)**(-n)` to `sec(x)**n`.

Given the output `cos(phi)**2`, the input must have been a `sec(phi)**(-2)`. This is because applying `f` to `sec(phi)**(-2)` would convert it to `cos(phi)**2`.

So, the input to `TR111` should be an expression representing `sec(phi)**(-2)`.
