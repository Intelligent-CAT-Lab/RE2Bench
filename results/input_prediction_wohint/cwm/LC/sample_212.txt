To find the input of the function `f` given the output, we need to analyze the behavior of the function. The function `f` takes a list `nums` and reverses it `len(nums) - 1` times. Reversing a list an even number of times returns the original list, while reversing it an odd number of times returns the reversed list. 

Given the output is a list of 7 elements, `len(nums) - 1` must be 6 (since `len(nums) - 1 = 6` implies `len(nums) = 7`). This means the list is reversed 6 times, which is an even number of times. Therefore, the output of the function is the same as the original input list. 

So, the input list must be the same as the output list. 

The output list is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`. Therefore, the input list must also be `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
