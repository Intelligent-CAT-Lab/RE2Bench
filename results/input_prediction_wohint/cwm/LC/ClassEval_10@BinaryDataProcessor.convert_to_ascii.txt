To solve this problem, let's follow the steps involved in converting binary data to ASCII using the given `convert_to_ascii` method.

First, we need to understand how the method works:
1. The method takes a binary string and processes it in chunks of 8 bits.
2. Each 8-bit binary chunk is converted to a decimal value.
3. These decimal values are then interpreted as ASCII characters.

Given the output "hebo", let's break it down:
- 'h' corresponds to ASCII 104.
- 'e' corresponds to ASCII 101.
- 'b' corresponds to ASCII 98.
- 'o' corresponds to ASCII 111.

Now, let's convert each ASCII character to its binary representation (8 bits):
- 'h' (104): 01101000
- 'e' (101): 01100101
- 'b' (98): 01100010
- 'o' (111): 01101111

Next, concatenate these binary strings to form the input binary string:
01101000 01100101 01100010 01101111

Therefore, the input binary string should be "01101000011001010110001001101111".
