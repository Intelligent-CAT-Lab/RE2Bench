Let's work backwards to determine the input of `add_event`. The function `add_event` adds an event to the `events` list of the `CalendarUtil` instance.

Given that the output is `null`, it indicates that the function doesn't return anything (or returns `None`), which aligns with the function's definition since it only appends to the list and doesn't return a value.

To find the input, we need to consider what event would be added to the `events` list. Since the output doesn't provide information about the event's contents, we must infer that the event is an object or a structure that can be added to the list. However, the actual details of the event (like its type, attributes, etc.) aren't provided.

But since the function's output is `null`, we can deduce that the input is simply an event object that, when added, doesn't produce any return value. Therefore, the input to `add_event` would be any valid event object.

Given the lack of specific details about the event, we'll represent it as a generic event object.
