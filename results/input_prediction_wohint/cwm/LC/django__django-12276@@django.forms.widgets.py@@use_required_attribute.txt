The function `use_required_attribute` is part of the `FileInput` class and calls the parent's `use_required_attribute` method with the `initial` parameter, then checks if `initial` is falsy. The output is `True`, which implies the parent method returned `True` and `initial` was falsy. Since the parent method likely checks if the field is required, the initial value being falsy (like an empty string or `None`) would lead to the attribute being required.

To achieve this output, the `initial` parameter must be falsy. A common falsy value for `initial` in this context could be an empty string. The `FileInput` class does not modify the `initial` value, so passing an empty string should suffice.
