Step 1: The output is `True`, so the feature is available.
Step 2: Since the feature is in `modules`, `check_module` is called.
Step 3: The feature must be in the `modules` dictionary.
Step 4: `check_module` attempts to import the module. Since the output is `True`, the import succeeds.
Step 5: The module is imported without any exceptions, so `True` is returned.

Now, let's predict the input:
- The feature must be a key in the `modules` dictionary.
- The corresponding module must be importable.
