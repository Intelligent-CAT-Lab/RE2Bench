To determine the input for the function `any_int` given the output `True`, we need to understand what conditions would make the function return `True`. 

The function `any_int` takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. It checks if all three are integers. If they are, it then checks if any one of the integers can be expressed as the sum of the other two. If either condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given that the output is `True`, we know two things:
1. All three inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` must be integers.
2. At least one of the following must be true: `x + y == z`, `x + z == y`, or `y + z == x`.

Let's consider possible combinations that satisfy these conditions. A simple and straightforward example would be if `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`, where `1 + 2 = 3`. This combination meets the criteria for the function to return `True`.

Therefore, the input that would result in the output `True` for the function `any_int` is `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`.
