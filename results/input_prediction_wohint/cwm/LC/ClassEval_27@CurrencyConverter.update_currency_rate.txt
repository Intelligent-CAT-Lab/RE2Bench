Let's work through this step by step.

The function `update_currency_rate` takes two arguments: `currency` and `new_rate`. Its purpose is to update the exchange rate for a given currency in the `rates` dictionary. If the currency is not found in the dictionary, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it updates the rate and implicitly returns `None` (since there's no explicit return statement).

The given output is `null`, which in Python terms would be `None`. This means the function didn't return `False`, so the currency must have been found in the `rates` dictionary. Therefore, the update was successful, and the function completed without returning anything explicitly, resulting in `None`.

Now, let's look at the `rates` dictionary initialized in `__init__`. The currencies present are: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CNY.

Since the output is `None`, the currency provided must be one of these. Let's assume the currency is 'EUR' (as an example), and the new rate could be any valid number. However, since the exact new rate isn't specified in the output, we can choose a plausible value, like 0.84, to represent a change.

Therefore, the input to `update_currency_rate` would be the currency 'EUR' and a new rate of 0.84.
