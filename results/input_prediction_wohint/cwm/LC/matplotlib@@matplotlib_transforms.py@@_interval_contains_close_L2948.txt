To get the output "np.True_", we need to analyze how the function `_interval_contains_close` works.

1. The function takes an interval, a value, and a relative tolerance (`rtol`).
2. It checks if the interval contains the value, allowing for a small tolerance (`rtol`).

Given the output is "np.True_", it means the value is within the interval, considering the tolerance.

Let's assume the value is within the interval. For simplicity, let's consider an interval where the value is exactly at one of the endpoints or very close to it, within the tolerance.

Suppose the interval is (1, 2) and the value is 2. The function should return True because 2 is within the interval (considering the tolerance).

But to be precise, let's think about the tolerance. The `rtol` is calculated as `(b - a) * rtol`, where `a` and `b` are the endpoints of the interval. If the interval is (1, 2), then `b - a` is 1. With `rtol=1e-10`, the actual tolerance is `1e-10`.

So, the value 2 is within the interval [1 - 1e-10, 2 + 1e-10], which includes 2 exactly. Hence, the function returns True.

Now, let's construct the input that would lead to this output.

The input should be an interval that contains the value, and the value should be at one of the endpoints or very close to it, within the tolerance.

Let's choose the interval (1, 2) and the value 2. The `rtol` is already set to 1e-10 in the function definition, so we don't need to specify it in the input.

However, the function's input format is not specified, but based on the example, it seems like the input is a JSON object with keys "interval", "val", and possibly "rtol".

But since the output is "np.True_", which is a numpy boolean, it's likely that the inputs are numpy arrays or numbers.

Let's assume the input is a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "interval": [1, 2],
    "val": 2
}

This input should lead to the output "np.True_".
