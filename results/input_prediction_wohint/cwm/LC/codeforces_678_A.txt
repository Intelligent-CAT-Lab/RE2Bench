Let's break down the problem step by step.

The code snippet is:
```
vamshi, z = map(int, input().split())
print((vamshi // z + 1) * z)
```

Given the output is `15`, we need to find the input that would produce this output.

1. The input is split into two integers `vamshi` and `z`.
2. The expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z` is evaluated and the result is printed.

Let's analyze the expression:
- `vamshi // z` performs integer division of `vamshi` by `z`.
- `+ 1` increments the result by 1.
- `* z` multiplies the result by `z`.

We know the output is `15`. Let's try to find `vamshi` and `z` such that `(vamshi // z + 1) * z = 15`.

One possible combination is `vamshi = 7` and `z = 5`:
- `7 // 5 = 1`
- `1 + 1 = 2`
- `2 * 5 = 10` (not 15)

Another possible combination is `vamshi = 10` and `z = 5`:
- `10 // 5 = 2`
- `2 + 1 = 3`
- `3 * 5 = 15` (matches the output)

Another possible combination is `vamshi = 8` and `z = 3`:
- `8 // 3 = 2`
- `2 + 1 = 3`
- `3 * 3 = 9` (not 15)

Another possible combination is `vamshi = 12` and `z = 3`:
- `12 // 3 = 4`
- `4 + 1 = 5`
- `5 * 3 = 15` (matches the output)

There are multiple possible inputs that can produce the output `15`. However, let's choose one possible input:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "10 5"
}
```
[/INPUT]
[/OUTPUT]
