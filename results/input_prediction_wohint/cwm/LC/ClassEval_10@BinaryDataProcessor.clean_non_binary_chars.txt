The function `clean_non_binary_chars` is called on an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor`. This method removes all characters from `self.binary_string` that are not '0' or '1'. 

Given that the output of the function is `null`, we need to consider what input would cause this method to return `null`. However, looking at the code, the method `clean_non_binary_chars` does not have a return statement. It modifies the instance variable `self.binary_string` in place and does not return anything, which in Python results in `None` by default.

Therefore, the output being `null` suggests that the method was called, but since it doesn't return any value, the output is `None`. To predict the input, we need to consider what `self.binary_string` was before calling `clean_non_binary_chars`.

Since the method filters out non-binary characters, the input to this method could be any string containing characters other than '0' and '1'. After filtering, `self.binary_string` will only contain '0's and '1's. However, the exact input cannot be uniquely determined from the output `null` because the method does not return any value related to the input string.

But based on the structure of the problem, we can assume that the input to `clean_non_binary_chars` is an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` with a `binary_string` that contains non-binary characters. The simplest case would be a string with at least one non-binary character.

For example, if the original `binary_string` was "101a01", after calling `clean_non_binary_chars`, it would become "101001". But since the output is `null`, we are only concerned with the fact that the method was called, not the actual transformation of the string.

Therefore, the input to `clean_non_binary_chars` would be an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` where `binary_string` has non-binary characters. The exact input string is not determinable from the output `null`, but we can provide a general form of the input.
