To predict the input of `car_race_collision`, given that the output is 9, let's analyze the function. The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` and returns its square (`n ** 2`). 

Given that the output is 9, we need to find an integer `n` such that `n ** 2 = 9`. The only integer that satisfies this equation is `n = 3` because 3 squared equals 9.

Therefore, the input to the function `car_race_collision` must have been 3.
