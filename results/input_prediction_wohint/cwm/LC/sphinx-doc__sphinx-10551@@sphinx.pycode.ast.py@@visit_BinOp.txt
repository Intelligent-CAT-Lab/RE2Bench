The output of `visit_BinOp` is "int | None". This function is processing a binary operation node in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Given the output, it seems like the binary operation involves types, possibly using the `|` operator to indicate a union type (as seen in Python type hints). The `|` operator here is used to represent the union of two types, `int` and `None`, which is equivalent to `Optional[int]`. Therefore, the input to `visit_BinOp` must be an AST node representing a binary operation between `int` and `None` using the `|` operator.

To achieve this, the node's left child should be an `ast.Name` node with the id "int", the operator should be an `ast.BitOr` node (since `|` is the bit-or operator in Python, which is also used for union types in type hints), and the right child should be an `ast.NameConstant` node with the value `None`.
