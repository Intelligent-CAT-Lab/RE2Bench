We are given the output of the `_generate_unsampled_indices` function, which returns an array of unsampled indices. Our task is to reverse-engineer the input parameters that led to this output.

First, let's understand what the function does:

1. It calls `_generate_sample_indices` to generate `n_samples_bootstrap` random indices (with replacement) from the range `[0, n_samples)`.
2. It counts how many times each index appears using `np.bincount`.
3. It creates a mask for indices that were never sampled (count == 0).
4. It returns the indices that were never sampled.

Given the output array, we can infer the following:

- The output array contains 56 elements, which means there are 56 unsampled indices.
- The maximum value in the output array is 149, which implies that `n_samples` (the total number of possible indices) is at least 150.

Now, let's work backwards to find the input parameters:

1. **`n_samples`**: Since the maximum unsampled index is 149, `n_samples` must be 150.
2. **`n_samples_bootstrap`**: The number of bootstrap samples is equal to the number of elements in the output of `_generate_sample_indices`. However, we don't have direct access to this value. But we can infer it from the fact that the output of `_generate_unsampled_indices` has 56 elements. This means that out of 150 possible indices, 56 were never sampled. Therefore, the number of bootstrap samples (`n_samples_bootstrap`) must be such that 56 indices were not selected in any of the bootstrap samples.

However, without more information about the random state or the specific values of `n_samples_bootstrap`, it's challenging to determine the exact value of `n_samples_bootstrap`. But we can make an educated guess based on typical usage scenarios. In many cases, `n_samples_bootstrap` is equal to `n_samples` (bootstrap sampling with replacement). Let's assume `n_samples_bootstrap` is also 150 for simplicity.

3. **`random_state`**: This is a random number generator or an integer seed. Since the output is specific, the random state must have been set to a particular value to reproduce this output. However, without more information, we can't determine the exact value of `random_state`. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume it's an integer seed, say 42 (a common default seed).

Putting it all together, the input parameters would be:

- `random_state`: 42 (or any specific seed that would reproduce the output)
- `n_samples`: 150
- `n_samples_bootstrap`: 150
