Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the input that led to the given output.

The function in question is `split` from the `RegexUtils` class, which uses `re.split` to split a string based on a given pattern.

Given output:
```
[
    "",
    " abiguygusu ",
    " kjgufwycs ",
    ""
]
```

This is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input text using the given pattern. The first and last elements are empty strings, suggesting that the pattern matches at the start and end of the string, respectively.

The second and third elements contain substrings surrounded by spaces, indicating that the pattern likely splits on certain words or sequences that are not present at the very beginning or end of the original text.

Let's consider possible patterns that could result in this split. Since the split occurs before "abiguygusu" and "kjgufwycs", and these seem like arbitrary strings, it's possible that the pattern is designed to split on specific words or phrases that are not part of the main content.

However, without more context about the specific requirements or the nature of the text being split, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact pattern. But we can make an educated guess based on common practices in text processing.

One possibility is that the pattern is designed to split on certain keywords or markers that indicate the start of a new section or paragraph in the text. For instance, if "abiguygusu" and "kjgufwycs" are placeholders for actual content markers, the pattern might be something like `r'\b marker \b'`, where "marker" represents the actual text to be split on.

Alternatively, the pattern could be a regular expression that matches specific sequences of characters, such as `r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]'`, which would split on any non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace characters.

Given the output, a plausible scenario is that the input text contains the substrings "abiguygusu" and "kjgufwycs" separated by some delimiters that the pattern is designed to split on. The empty strings at the beginning and end suggest that the pattern matches at the start and end of the text, respectively.

Based on this analysis, a possible input could be:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "\\b(abiguygusu|kjgufwycs)\\b",
        "text": " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs "
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

Or, if the pattern is designed to split on non-alphanumeric characters:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]",
        "text": "abiguygusu kjgufwycs"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

However, the exact pattern and text would depend on the specific requirements of the application.

Given the information provided, the most likely input is:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "\\b(abiguygusu|kjgufwycs)\\b",
        "text": " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs "
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "pattern": "\\b(abiguygusu|kjgufwycs)\\b",
        "text": " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs "
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
