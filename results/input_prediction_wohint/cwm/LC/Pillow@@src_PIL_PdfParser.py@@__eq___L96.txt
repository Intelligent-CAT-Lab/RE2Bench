The `__eq__` method of the `IndirectReference` class is being called. The output is `False`, which means the equality check between `self` and `other` did not pass. Let's analyze why this might happen.

The method checks three conditions:
1. `other.__class__` must be the same as `self.__class__`.
2. `other.object_id` must equal `self.object_id`.
3. `other.generation` must equal `self.generation`.

Since the result is `False`, at least one of these conditions failed. Given that the output is `False`, the most likely scenario is that either `other` is not an instance of `IndirectReference`, or the `object_id` or `generation` values do not match.

To predict the input, we need to construct `self` and `other` such that at least one of these conditions is not met. Let's assume that `other` is of a different class but has the same `object_id` and `generation`. This would cause the first condition to fail, resulting in `False`.
