The `make_random_password` function is called with specific arguments to generate a password. The function signature is:

```python
def make_random_password(self, length=10, allowed_chars='abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'):
```

Given the output password is "PNFHWJjwvd" (10 characters long), we can deduce the following:

1. The `length` parameter is 10, as the output password is 10 characters long.
2. The `allowed_chars` parameter must include all the characters present in the output password. Let's check the characters in "PNFHWJjwvd":
   - Uppercase letters: P, N, F, H, W, J
   - Lowercase letters: j, w, v, d
   - No digits are present.

The default `allowed_chars` includes uppercase letters (excluding O, I, 0, 1, l), lowercase letters (excluding l, o, i), and digits. However, the output password only contains uppercase and lowercase letters from the default set, except for the presence of 'j' and 'w' in lowercase, which are included in the default allowed characters.

Therefore, the `allowed_chars` parameter is likely the default value, as it includes all the necessary characters for the generated password.

So, the input to `make_random_password` would be the default values for `length` and `allowed_chars`, but since the output is 10 characters long, we confirm that `length=10` is explicitly or implicitly passed.
