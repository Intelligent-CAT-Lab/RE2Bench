First, let's analyze the given function. The `construct_stop_word_list` method doesn't take any parameters and simply returns a predefined list of stop words: ['a', 'an', 'the'].

Given the output is ['a', 'an', 'the'], which matches the list exactly, we can infer that the input does not affect the output in this case. The function does not depend on any instance variables or parameters passed to it. Therefore, the input is simply an instance of the class NLPDataProcessor without any specific arguments or keyword arguments needed.
