To determine the input of `math_to_image` given the output, we need to trace back the execution of the function. The output is `1.0`, which is returned by `math_to_image` as the `depth` variable.

1. The `math_to_image` function calls `parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)`, which returns `width, height, depth, _, _`. The `depth` returned by this function is `1.0`, implying the parsed math expression has a depth of `1.0` at `dpi=72`.

2. Since `depth` is `1.0`, and it's directly returned by `math_to_image`, the input to `math_to_image` must be such that the parsed math expression results in this depth.

Given this information, let's consider a simple math expression that could result in a depth of `1.0` at `dpi=72`. A possible expression could be a single character or a simple formula that doesn't alter the depth significantly.

However, without more specific information about the math expression or additional context, we can only speculate on the exact input. But we can infer that the input string `s` passed to `math_to_image` should be a valid math expression that, when parsed, results in a depth of `1.0`.

Considering the structure of the `math_to_image` function and the information provided, a plausible input could be a simple math expression like `$a$` or any single character that doesn't change the depth significantly.

Given these considerations, the input to `math_to_image` could look something like this:
