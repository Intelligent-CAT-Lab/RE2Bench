Let's work through the problem step by step. We are given a Python function `add(x: int, y: int)` that returns the sum of its two arguments. The output is `1223`. We need to determine the input values `x` and `y` that would produce this output.

The function simply returns `x + y`. So, we need to find integers `x` and `y` such that their sum is `1223`.

Possible combinations could be:
- `x = 0`, `y = 1223`
- `x = 1`, `y = 1222`
- `x = 2`, `y = 1221`
- ...
- `x = 1222`, `y = 1`
- `x = 1223`, `y = 0`

However, without more constraints or information, there are infinitely many solutions. But since the problem asks for "the input," it's likely expecting a specific pair. A common convention might be to use non-negative integers or to present them in a specific order (e.g., `x <= y`).

One simple solution is `x = 0` and `y = 1223`, or `x = 1223` and `y = 0`. Another could be `x = 611` and `y = 612` (splitting the sum roughly in half).

But since the problem doesn't specify any further constraints, the most straightforward answer would be `x = 0` and `y = 1223`.
