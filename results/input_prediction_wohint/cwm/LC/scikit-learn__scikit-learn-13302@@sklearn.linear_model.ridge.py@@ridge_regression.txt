1. The function `ridge_regression` is a wrapper that calls `_ridge_regression` with additional parameters set to specific defaults (e.g., `X_scale=None`, `X_offset=None`, and `check_input=True`).
2. The output of `ridge_regression` is a list or array of coefficients, which suggests that the input features (`X`) and target (`y`) have been processed to fit a ridge regression model with regularization parameter `alpha`.
3. To reconstruct the input, we need to identify plausible values for `X`, `y`, and `alpha` that would result in the output coefficients when passed through the ridge regression algorithm.
4. Given the output coefficients, we can infer that the input data likely consists of multiple features and samples, with `alpha` being a positive value that controls the strength of regularization.
5. Since the exact values of `X` and `y` are unknown, we can assume hypothetical values that could lead to the given coefficients. For simplicity, let's assume `X` is a 2D array with 5 features and 100 samples, `y` is a 1D array of target values, and `alpha` is a positive scalar (e.g., 0.1).
6. The other parameters (`sample_weight`, `solver`, `max_iter`, `tol`, `verbose`, `random_state`, `return_n_iter`, `return_intercept`) are set to their default values as they do not affect the output coefficients directly.
