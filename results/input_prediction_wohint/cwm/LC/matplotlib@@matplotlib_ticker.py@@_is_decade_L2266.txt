To solve this problem, let's first understand the function `_is_decade`. It checks if a given number `x` is a decade of a given `base` (default is 10) within a relative tolerance `rtol`.

1. **Function Overview**: The function first checks if `x` is finite. If not, it returns `False`. If `x` is 0.0, it returns `True` because log(0) is undefined, but in this context, 0 is considered a decade of any base.

2. **Logarithmic Check**: It then calculates the logarithm of the absolute value of `x` with respect to the given `base`. This is done to understand how many times `base` fits into `x`, essentially checking if `x` is a power of `base`.

3. **Rounding and Comparison**: If `rtol` is not provided (i.e., it's `None`), the function checks if the calculated logarithm is close to its rounded value. This is essentially asking if `x` is a decade of `base` without any specific tolerance. If `rtol` is provided, it checks the closeness within that tolerance.

Given the output `np.True_`, we know the function returned `True`, meaning `x` is indeed a decade of the given `base`.

**Input Prediction**:

For `_is_decade` to return `True`, `x` must be a decade of `base`. Since the default `base` is 10, let's assume `x` is a power of 10 (e.g., 1, 10, 100, etc.) or 0, as these are the most straightforward cases where the function would return `True` without needing to specify `rtol`.

Given that the output is `np.True_`, a plausible input could be:
- `x = 10` (since 10 is a decade of 10)
- `x = 100` (since 100 is also a decade of 10)
- `x = 0.0` (since log(0) is undefined but 0 is treated as a special case)

However, since we need to predict the input based on the output `np.True_` and considering the function's behavior, let's choose a straightforward case where `x` is exactly a decade of the base without needing `rtol`.

Let's choose `x = 10` as our predicted input because it directly fits the condition without needing any additional parameters.

Therefore, the input could be represented as:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "x": 10,
    "base": 10,
    "rtol": null
}
