The code uses `math.ceil(h / a)`, where `h` and `a` are integers. The output is 6. 

To find `h` and `a` that satisfy this, consider the properties of the `ceil` function: it rounds up to the nearest integer. 

If `h / a` equals 5.0 exactly, `ceil(h / a)` would be 5, not 6. 

If `h / a` equals 5.5, `ceil(h / a)` would be 6. 

However, since `h` and `a` are integers, the only way to get `ceil(h / a)` equal to 6 is if `h / a` is strictly between 5 and 6, but not exactly 6. 

One possible combination is `h = 30` and `a = 5`, since `30 / 5 = 6`, but that would give `ceil(30 / 5) = 6`. 

Another possibility is `h = 29` and `a = 5`, since `29 / 5 = 5.8`, and `ceil(5.8) = 6`. 

Therefore, the input could be "29 5".
