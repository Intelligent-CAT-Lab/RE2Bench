What will be the input of `simplify` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": true
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

<think>
The function returns True if the division of the numerators and denominators results in a whole number. Let's analyze the given output and work backward to find the possible input.

Given that the output is True, it means that the division of the numerators and denominators is a whole number. 

Let's denote the input as `x = a/b` and `n = c/d`. The function splits these fractions into their numerators and denominators, multiplies the numerators and denominators separately, and checks if the result is a whole number.

The key equation here is: 
(numerator) / (denominator) = int(numerator / denominator)

This implies that the numerator is a multiple of the denominator.

Let's consider possible values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that would satisfy this condition.

One possible scenario is:
- `a = 2`, `b = 1` (so `x = "2/1"`)
- `c = 3`, `d = 1` (so `n = "3/1"`)

In this case:
- `numerator = 2 * 3 = 6`
- `denominator = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `6 / 1 = 6`, which is an integer, so the function returns True.

Another possible scenario is:
- `a = 4`, `b = 2` (so `x = "4/2"`)
- `c = 3`, `d = 1` (so `n = "3/1"`)

In this case:
- `numerator = 4 * 3 = 12`
- `denominator = 2 * 1 = 2`
- `12 / 2 = 6`, which is an integer, so the function returns True.

There are infinitely many possibilities, but we need to find one that fits the format of the input.

Let's choose the first scenario for simplicity.
