To determine the input of the `_new` method, we need to work backward from the given output. Let's break down each attribute of the output and see how it relates to the input parameters of the `_new` method.

1. **`_shape` Attribute**:
   - The output shows `_shape` as an empty object (`{}`), but in the context of the `_new` method, `_shape` is derived from the `shape` parameter passed to the method. However, since `_shape` is a `Tuple` object, an empty object might indicate an issue or a special case, but it's more likely a placeholder for an empty tuple `()`.
   - This suggests that the `shape` parameter passed to `_new` might be an empty iterable or something that results in an empty tuple after processing.

2. **`_array` Attribute**:
   - The output shows `_array` as `null`, which in Python terms could mean `None`. However, `_array` is initialized as a list of the `flat_list` after it's been flattened. If `_array` is `None`, it implies that `flat_list` was empty or not properly initialized.
   - This could mean that the `iterable` passed to `_new` was empty or resulted in an empty list after flattening.

3. **`_rank` Attribute**:
   - The output shows `_rank` as `2`. The `_rank` attribute is determined by the length of the `shape` tuple. Since `_rank` is `2`, the `shape` tuple must have had two elements.
   - This suggests that the `shape` parameter passed to `_new` was an iterable with two elements, e.g., `(2, 2)` or any other pair of numbers.

4. **`_loop_size` Attribute**:
   - The output shows `_loop_size` as `"4"`. However, `_loop_size` is calculated as the product of all elements in the `shape` tuple. If `_loop_size` is `4`, and considering `_rank` is `2`, the `shape` could have been `(2, 2)` because `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - This supports the idea that the `shape` parameter was `(2, 2)`.

Given these observations, let's reconstruct the possible input to the `_new` method:

- **`iterable`**: Since `_array` is `None` (or empty), the `iterable` might have been empty or resulted in an empty list after processing. However, to satisfy the `_loop_size` of `4`, there should be 4 elements in total when flattened. Let's assume `iterable` was something like `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, which would flatten to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

- **`shape`**: Based on `_rank` and `_loop_size`, the `shape` should be `(2, 2)`.

Putting it all together, the input to the `_new` method would likely be an `iterable` that results in 4 elements when flattened and a `shape` of `(2, 2)`. However, since the exact elements of the iterable aren't specified in the output, we'll focus on the structure.

Therefore, the predicted input for the `_new` method, given the output, would be:
