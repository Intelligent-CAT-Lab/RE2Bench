To determine the input of the `unique` function, let's consider how it works step by step. The function takes a list `l`, converts it into a set (which removes duplicates), then sorts the set and returns it as a list.

Given the output `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, this suggests that after removing duplicates and sorting, these are the remaining elements.

So, the original list could have these numbers in any order, with possible duplicates. For example, the input list could have been `[3, 2, 2, 5, 0, 9, 123]`, which would result in the set `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`. Sorting this set gives the output `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.

Therefore, one possible input is `[3, 2, 2, 5, 0, 9, 123]`.
