To determine the input of the `parse` function given the output, we need to analyze the output and work backwards.

The output is `<Version('1.11.3')>`. This suggests that the `parse` function successfully created a `Version` object from the input string.

The `parse` function attempts to create a `Version` object. If that fails, it falls back to creating a `LegacyVersion` object. However, since the output is a `Version` object, we can infer that the input string was valid according to the `Version` class's parsing rules.

The `Version` class parses a version string into its components (epoch, release, pre, post, dev, local) and stores them in a `_Version` object. It also generates a key for sorting.

Given that the output is `<Version('1.11.3')>`, we can deduce that the input string must be `'1.11.3'`, as this is the string that would be parsed into the `Version` object represented by the output.

Therefore, the input to the `parse` function must be the string `'1.11.3'`.
