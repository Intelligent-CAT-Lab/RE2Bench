The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` checks if a number `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8. Given that the output is `True`, we can deduce the following:

1. The number `n` must be even because the condition `n % 2 == 0` is met.
2. The number `n` must be greater than or equal to 8 because the condition `n >= 8` is met.

Therefore, possible values for `n` include any even number from 8 onwards. The simplest such value is 8 itself.
