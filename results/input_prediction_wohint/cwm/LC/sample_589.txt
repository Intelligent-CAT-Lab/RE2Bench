Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the function:

def f(num):
    num.append(num[-1])
    return num

And the output is:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [
        -70,
        20,
        9,
        1,
        1
    ]
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

The function takes a list 'num', appends its last element to itself, and returns the modified list.

Looking at the output, the list has 5 elements: [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]. The last two elements are the same, which means the last element (1) was appended to the list.

So, before the function executed, the list must have been [-70, 20, 9, 1]. 

Therefore, the input to the function must be this list.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {}, 
    "args": {
        "num": [-70, 20, 9, 1]
    },
    kwargs: {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
