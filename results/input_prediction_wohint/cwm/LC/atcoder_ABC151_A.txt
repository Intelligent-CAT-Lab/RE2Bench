To predict the input of the given code snippet, let's analyze the code step by step.

The code snippet reads an input from the user using the `input()` function, converts it to its ASCII value using `ord()`, adds 1 to this value, and then converts it back to a character using `chr()`. Finally, it prints the resulting character.

Given the output is `b`, we need to find the input that, when processed by this code, results in `b`.

The ASCII value of `b` is 98. Since the code adds 1 to the ASCII value of the input character to get `b`, the ASCII value of the input character must be 98 - 1 = 97.

The character with ASCII value 97 is `a`.

Therefore, the input to the code snippet must be `a`.
