Let's analyze the given Python code step by step to understand how the output is generated from the input.

The code takes four integers as input, representing the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It then calculates the differences `a = x2 - x1` and `b = y2 - y1`. The final output is generated by printing the results of the expressions `x2 - b`, `y2 + a`, `x1 - b`, and `y1 + a`.

Given the output:
```
101 99 101 100
```

Let's denote the output values as:
- `x2 - b = 101`
- `y2 + a = 99`
- `x1 - b = 101`
- `y1 + a = 100`

We need to find the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` that satisfy these equations.

From the equations `x2 - b = 101` and `x1 - b = 101`, we can see that `x2 = x1`, because subtracting the same value `b` from both `x2` and `x1` results in the same value.

Let's assume `x1 = x2 = x`. Then, `a = x2 - x1 = x - x = 0`.

Now, let's substitute `a = 0` into the other equations:
- `y2 + a = 99` becomes `y2 + 0 = 99`, so `y2 = 99`.
- `y1 + a = 100` becomes `y1 + 0 = 100`, so `y1 = 100`.

Now we have `x1 = x2 = x` and `y1 = 100`, `y2 = 99`. We need to find the value of `x`.

From the equation `x2 - b = 101`, we know that `x - b = 101`. Since `b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1`, we can substitute this value into the equation:
`x - (-1) = 101`
`x + 1 = 101`
`x = 100`

So, `x1 = x2 = 100`, `y1 = 100`, and `y2 = 99`.

Therefore, the input to the code must have been:
```
100 100 100 99
```
