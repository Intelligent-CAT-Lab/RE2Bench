To determine the input of `get_encodings_from_content` given the output, let's analyze the function step by step.

1. **Understanding the Function**: The function `get_encodings_from_content` is designed to extract encoding information from HTML content. It uses three regular expressions to find charset declarations in meta tags, content attributes of meta tags, and XML declarations.

2. **Regular Expressions Used**:
   - `charset_re`: Finds charset declarations in meta tags.
   - `pragma_re`: Finds charset declarations in the content attribute of meta tags.
   - `xml_re`: Finds encoding declarations in XML prologues.

3. **Given Output**: The output is a list containing a single string "UTF-8", indicating that the function successfully extracted "UTF-8" as the encoding from the input content.

4. **Reverse Engineering the Input**: To produce the output "UTF-8", the input content must contain a declaration that matches one of the regular expressions used in the function. The simplest and most straightforward way to achieve this is by having an HTML meta tag that explicitly declares the charset as "UTF-8".

5. **Possible Input Content**: A content that could lead to this output could be a string containing a meta tag like `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, or a content attribute like `<meta content=";charset=UTF-8">`, or an XML declaration like `<?xml encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

Given the simplicity of the output and the goal to match it, a likely input that would produce "UTF-8" as the output could be a string that directly matches one of the patterns the function is looking for.

```
{
    "content": "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">"
