To predict the input of the `deposit` method given the output, let's analyze the steps:

1. The output is `300`, which is the updated balance after a deposit.
2. The `deposit` method adds an `amount` to the current `balance` and returns the new balance.
3. Assuming the initial balance is `0` (unless specified otherwise), the deposit amount would be `300` because `0 + 300 = 300`.

However, if there was a previous balance, we need to consider that. Since no previous balance is provided, we'll assume it starts at `0`. Thus, the deposit amount is `300`.

But let's also consider another possibility: if the initial balance was non-zero, the deposit amount would be the difference between the output and the initial balance. Without knowing the initial balance, the most straightforward assumption is that it starts at `0`.

Therefore, the input to the `deposit` method would be an `amount` of `300`.
