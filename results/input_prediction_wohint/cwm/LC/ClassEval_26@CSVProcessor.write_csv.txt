Let's analyze the given output of the `write_csv` function, which returns 1. This means that the function successfully wrote data to a CSV file. 

The `write_csv` function takes two parameters: `data` and `file_name`. The `data` parameter is expected to be a list of lists or a list of tuples, where each inner list or tuple represents a row in the CSV file. The `file_name` parameter is a string representing the name of the file to be created or overwritten.

Since the function returns 1, it implies that the file was opened successfully, and the data was written without any exceptions. 

Now, let's consider possible inputs that could lead to this successful execution. 

1. The `data` could be a valid list of lists or tuples, and the `file_name` could be a valid file path where the program has write permissions. 

For example, if the `data` is `[["Name", "Age"], ["John", 30], ["Alice", 25]]` and the `file_name` is `"example.csv"`, the function would create a file named "example.csv" in the current working directory and write the data into it, resulting in the output 1.

Another example could be an empty list for `data`, which would result in an empty CSV file being created, but the function would still return 1 because it successfully wrote (or rather, didn't write anything to) the file.

However, without more specific information about the file path, permissions, or the exact content of the data, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact input. But based on the function's behavior, any valid `data` and `file_name` combination that allows the function to execute without exceptions would result in an output of 1.
