The output of `delete_from_database` is `null`, which means the function didn't return any value. Looking at the function definition, it doesn't have a return statement, so it returns `None` by default. 

To predict the input, I need to consider the steps the function takes:
1. It connects to a SQLite database.
2. It creates a cursor object.
3. It prepares a DELETE SQL query to delete a record from a specified table where the 'name' column matches a given value.
4. It executes the query with the provided name.
5. It commits the changes and closes the connection.

Since the output is `null`, the function executed successfully without errors, implying that the database connection was successful, and the DELETE query was executed. 

The input to the function would be the `table_name` and `name` parameters. However, without more context about the database schema or the data, I can't determine the exact values. But I can infer that the function was called with valid parameters that allowed it to execute the DELETE query successfully.

Given the structure of the problem, the input should be in JSON format, containing the instance variables and the arguments passed to the method. The `self` object would include the `database_name`, and the `args` would include `table_name` and `name`.

So, the predicted input would be something like:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "database_name": "example.db"
    },
    "args": {
        "table_name": "users",
        "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
