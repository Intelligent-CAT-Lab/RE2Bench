Let's break down the code and the given output to find the input.

The code calculates the total sum of an arithmetic series and checks if it's less than or equal to a given number `n`. If it is, the code prints 0; otherwise, it prints the difference between the sum and `n`.

Given output is 0, which means `sum <= n`.

The formula for the sum of the series is `sum = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w) = k * w * (w + 1) / 2`.

We need to find integers `k`, `n`, and `w` such that `k * w * (w + 1) / 2 <= n`.

Let's consider possible values for `w` and `k` that could result in a sum that's less than or equal to `n`.

For simplicity, let's start with small values of `w` and `k`.

If `w = 1`, then `sum = k * 1 = k`. So, `k <= n`.

If `w = 2`, then `sum = k * (1 + 2) = 3k`. So, `3k <= n`.

If `w = 3`, then `sum = k * (1 + 2 + 3) = 6k`. So, `6k <= n`.

Let's try `w = 1` and `k = 1`. Then `sum = 1`, so `n` must be at least 1.

Let's try `w = 1`, `k = 1`, and `n = 1`. This satisfies the condition `sum <= n`.

Therefore, the input could be `1 1 1`.
