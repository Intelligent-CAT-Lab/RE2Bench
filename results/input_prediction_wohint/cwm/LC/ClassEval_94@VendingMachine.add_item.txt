To solve this, we need to determine the input parameters to the `add_item` method that would result in the given output.

The output is `null`, which implies that the method didn't add a new item or increase the quantity of an existing item. 

The `add_item` method calls `restock_item`, which only restocks an item if it already exists in the inventory. If the item doesn't exist, `restock_item` returns `False`, and `add_item` adds the item to the inventory. 

However, if the `quantity` is 0, `restock_item` would not add the item to the inventory, and `add_item` would not add the item either. 

Therefore, the input to the `add_item` method should be an item name, price, and quantity, where the quantity is 0.

Here is the input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "inventory": {}
    },
    "args": {
        "item_name": "Apple",
        "price": 1,
        "quantity": 0
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
