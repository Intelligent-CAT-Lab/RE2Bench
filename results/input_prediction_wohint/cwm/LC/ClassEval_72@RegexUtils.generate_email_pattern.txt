Okay, I need to determine the input to the `generate_email_pattern` method given its output. Let's look at the code for this method:

```python
def generate_email_pattern(self):
    pattern = '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'
    return pattern
```

Hmm, the method doesn't take any parameters. It simply assigns a specific string to `pattern` and returns it. The output provided is the returned value of this method. 

So, the input to the method would be the instance of the class, because it's an instance method. Since the method doesn't use any arguments, the `args` and `kwargs` should be empty. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of `RegexUtils`, but since the method doesn't modify any instance variables, the specific attributes of `self` don't matter here.

Therefore, the input should be an instance of `RegexUtils` with no arguments passed to the method. However, in the context of predicting the input for this specific call, since the method doesn't require any arguments, the input would just be the method being called on an instance, with no additional parameters.

[INPUT]
{
    "self": {
        "__class__": "RegexUtils"
    },
    "args": [],
    "kwargs": {}
}
