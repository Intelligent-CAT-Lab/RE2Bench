Let's break down the given output and the `__invert__` method.

1. **Understanding the Output:**
   - The output shows an object with `_array_form = null` and `_size = 5`.
   - The `__invert__` method uses `_af_invert(self._array_form)` to invert the permutation.
   - Since `_array_form` is `null`, we need to understand how `_af_invert` handles this.

2. **Analyzing `_af_invert`:**
   - `_af_invert` is not defined in the given code snippet, but based on its usage, it likely inverts a permutation's array form.
   - If `_array_form` is `null`, it might imply that the array form hasn't been explicitly set and needs to be derived from another attribute, possibly `_size`.

3. **Considering the `Permutation` Class:**
   - The `Permutation` class has several attributes like `_array_form`, `_cyclic_form`, `_cycle_structure`, `_size`, and `_rank`.
   - The `_size` attribute is set to 5, indicating the permutation is for a set of size 5.

4. **Inverting a Permutation:**
   - The inverse of a permutation swaps the order of elements back to their original positions.
   - For a permutation of size 5, the inverse can be represented in its array form, which is likely what `_af_invert` returns.

5. **Predicting the Input:**
   - To get the output where `_array_form = null` and `_size = 5`, the input must be a permutation of size 5 where the `_array_form` hasn't been explicitly set or is being ignored.
   - The input to `__invert__` should be a permutation object with `_size = 5` and possibly `_array_form` not set or set to `null`.

Given these considerations, the input to `__invert__` should be a permutation object of size 5. The exact `_array_form` isn't provided, but since the output has `_array_form = null`, it's reasonable to assume the input also has `_array_form = null` or it's not relevant for the inversion in this context.
