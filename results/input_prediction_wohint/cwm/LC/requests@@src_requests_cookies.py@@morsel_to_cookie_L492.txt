Let's analyze the given output and work backward to determine the input.

The output of `morsel_to_cookie` is null. This means that the function did not raise an exception and successfully created a cookie. However, since the output is explicitly stated as null, we can infer that the function might not have executed any meaningful code that would produce a non-null output. This could happen if none of the conditions in the function were met, leading to the `expires` variable remaining `None` and the function returning a cookie object with default values.

Looking at the function `morsel_to_cookie`, the first condition checks if `morsel['max-age']` is truthy. If it is, it calculates the `expires` value. If not, it checks if `morsel['expires']` is truthy and parses it. If neither condition is met, `expires` remains `None`.

Given that the output is null, it's likely that both `morsel['max-age']` and `morsel['expires']` are falsy (e.g., empty strings, zero, or `None`), causing the function to skip both conditional blocks and return a cookie with default values.

Now, let's consider the `create_cookie` function, which is called at the end of `morsel_to_cookie`. This function creates a cookie object with default values unless overridden by the `kwargs` passed to it. Since the output is null, it's possible that the cookie object was created successfully but not used or stored, resulting in a null output.

To predict the input, we need to construct a `morsel` dictionary that would lead to this outcome. The `morsel` should have falsy values for both `'max-age'` and `'expires'`. Additionally, it should contain the necessary keys expected by the `create_cookie` function, such as `'comment'`, `'domain'`, `'httponly'`, `'path'`, `'secure'`, `'version'`, and the `key` and `value` attributes.

Here's a possible input that could result in the given output:
