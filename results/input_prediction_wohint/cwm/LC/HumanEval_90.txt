To determine the input of the `next_smallest` function given the output, we need to reverse-engineer the steps taken by the function.

1. The function first converts the input list into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts this set. This implies that the original list had duplicates and was sorted before the duplicates were removed.
2. The function returns the second smallest element in the sorted list of unique elements. Given the output is `2`, this means `2` is the second smallest unique number in the original list.

Let's consider what the original list could have been:
- Since `2` is the second smallest unique number, the smallest unique number must be `1`.
- The original list must have contained `1` and `2` to ensure these are the first two elements in the sorted set.
- The list could have contained other numbers, but they must have been either duplicates of `1` or `2`, or larger than `2`.

A possible input list that fits this description is `[2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`. When converted to a set, it becomes `{1, 2, 3}`, which when sorted becomes `[1, 2, 3]`. The second element in this sorted list is `2`, matching the given output.

However, to strictly adhere to the given format and provide a single, concise input, we should consider the simplest form that still satisfies the conditions. This would be a list with the smallest two unique numbers and their duplicates, ensuring `2` is the second smallest unique number after removing duplicates and sorting.

The simplest list that fits these conditions is `[1, 2]`.
