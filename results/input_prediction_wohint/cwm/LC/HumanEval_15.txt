Let's analyze the problem step by step.

The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string that consists of the numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

The output is given as:
```
{
    "output": "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
}
```
This output string contains numbers from 0 to 10, which means that the input `n` must be 10.

Therefore, the input to the function `string_sequence` is:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 10
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
<tool: python>
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 10
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
</tool>
