To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

The code takes an input line, splits it into three integers `r`, `D`, and `x`, then iterates 10 times, updating `x` each time using the formula `x = r * x - D` and printing the result.

Given the output:
```
110
120
140
180
260
420
740
1380
2660
5220
```
We need to find the initial values of `r`, `D`, and `x` that would produce this sequence.

Let's start with the first few values to identify a pattern or possible values for `r` and `D`.

1. First iteration: `x = r * x_initial - D = 110`
2. Second iteration: `x = r * 110 - D = 120`
3. Third iteration: `x = r * 120 - D = 140`

From the first two iterations, we can set up equations:
- `r * x_initial - D = 110`
- `r * 110 - D = 120`

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:
`r * (x_initial - 110) = -10`

This implies that `r` must be a factor of 10 (since the right side is -10). Possible values for `r` could be 1, 2, 5, or 10 (and their negatives, but since we're dealing with positive outputs, we'll focus on positive `r`).

Let's test `r = 2` as a simple factor:
- If `r = 2`, then `2 * (x_initial - 110) = -10` => `x_initial - 110 = -5` => `x_initial = 105`

Now, let's check if `r = 2`, `x_initial = 105` satisfies the first equation and gives us a consistent `D`:
- `2 * 105 - D = 110` => `210 - D = 110` => `D = 100`

With `r = 2`, `D = 100`, and `x_initial = 105`, let's verify the sequence:
1. `x = 2 * 105 - 100 = 210 - 100 = 110` (matches the first output)
2. `x = 2 * 110 - 100 = 220 - 100 = 120` (matches the second output)
3. `x = 2 * 120 - 100 = 240 - 100 = 140` (matches the third output)

Continuing this pattern:
4. `x = 2 * 140 - 100 = 280 - 100 = 180` (matches the fourth output)
5. `x = 2 * 180 - 100 = 360 - 100 = 260` (matches the fifth output)
6. `x = 2 * 260 - 100 = 520 - 100 = 420` (matches the sixth output)
7. `x = 2 * 420 - 100 = 840 - 100 = 740` (matches the seventh output)
8. `x = 2 * 740 - 100 = 1480 - 100 = 1380` (matches the eighth output)
9. `x = 2 * 1380 - 100 = 2760 - 100 = 2660` (matches the ninth output)
10. `x = 2 * 2660 - 100 = 5320 - 100 = 5220` (matches the tenth output)

All values match the given output sequence. Therefore, the initial input must have been `r = 2`, `D = 100`, and `x = 105`.
