From the given code snippet and output, we can deduce the input value as follows:

1. The code reads an integer input and assigns it to variable `x`.
2. If `x` equals 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1.
3. The output is 0, indicating that the condition `x == 1` was met.
4. Therefore, the input must have been 1 for the code to execute the print statement that outputs 0.

<think>
Based on the code logic and the provided output, the only input that leads to the output 0 is when x is equal to 1. So, the input must have been 1.
