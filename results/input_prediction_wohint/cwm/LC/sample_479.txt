Let's analyze the function and the given output to deduce the input.

The function `f` takes a list `nums` and two indices `pop1` and `pop2`. It removes the elements at positions `pop1 - 1` and `pop2 - 1` (since list indices in Python are 0-based) and returns the modified list.

The output is `[1, 2, 3]`. This means that after removing two elements from the original list, the remaining elements are 1, 2, and 3.

To figure out the original list and the indices that were removed, let's consider possible scenarios.

1. If the original list had 5 elements, and two were removed, the resulting list would have 3 elements. The output list is `[1, 2, 3]`, so maybe the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the elements removed were 4 and 5. But this would mean `pop1` and `pop2` are 5 and 4 (or vice versa), since we need to remove the last two elements. However, if we remove the 4th and 5th elements (indices 3 and 4), the resulting list would still be `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. Alternatively, the original list could have been `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the elements removed were 2 and 4. This would require `pop1` to be 2 and `pop2` to be 4 (or vice versa). Removing the element at index 1 (which is 2) and then the element at index 3 (which is 4) would leave `[1, 3]`, which doesn't match the output.

3. Another possibility is that the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the elements removed were 2 and 4. This would mean `pop1` is 2 and `pop2` is 4. Removing the element at index 1 (2) and then the element at index 3 (4) would leave `[1, 3, 5]`, which doesn't match the output.

Wait, let's think again. The output is `[1, 2, 3]`. This suggests that the original list must have been longer than 3 elements, and the two elements removed were not among the first three. Let's try a different approach.

Suppose the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. If we remove the 4th element (index 3) first, the list becomes `[1, 2, 3]`. Then, removing any other element would result in a list with 2 elements, which doesn't match the output. So this can't be the case.

Another scenario: the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. If we remove the 5th element (index 4) first, the list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Then, removing the 4th element (index 3) would leave `[1, 2, 3]`. This matches the output. So in this case, `pop1` would be 5 and `pop2` would be 4.

Alternatively, if we remove the 4th element first (index 3), the list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5]`. Then, removing the 5th element (index 4) would leave `[1, 2, 3]`. This also works, with `pop1` being 4 and `pop2` being 5.

So the original list could have been `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the indices removed were 4 and 5 (in any order).

Therefore, the input to the function `f` would be `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `pop1 = 4`, and `pop2 = 5` (or vice versa).
