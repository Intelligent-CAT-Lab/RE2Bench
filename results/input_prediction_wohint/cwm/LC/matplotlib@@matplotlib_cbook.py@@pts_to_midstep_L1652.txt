The function `pts_to_midstep` takes an array `x` and variable number of arguments `args`. The output is a 2D array where the first row consists of midpoints between consecutive elements of `x`, and the subsequent rows are the elements of `args` repeated to match the length of the first row.

The given output is:
```
array([[ 0. ,  0.5,  0.5,  1.5,  1.5,  2.5,  2.5,  3.5,  3.5,  4.5,  4.5,
         5.5,  5.5,  6.5,  6.5,  7.5,  7.5,  8.5,  8.5,  9. ],
       [ 1. ,  1. ,  2. ,  2. ,  3. ,  3. ,  4. ,  4. ,  5. ,  5. ,  6. ,
         6. ,  7. ,  7. ,  8. ,  8. ,  9. ,  9. , 10. , 10. ]])
```

This suggests that the input array `x` has 10 elements (since the first row of the output has 20 elements, which corresponds to the midpoints and endpoints of `x`). The midpoints are calculated as the average of consecutive elements in `x`.

Looking at the first row of the output, the midpoints are:
0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5

These midpoints are the averages of consecutive pairs in `x`. The endpoints are 0 and 9.

Therefore, the input array `x` is likely:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The second row of the output consists of the elements of `args` repeated to match the length of the first row. The elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, repeated twice.

Therefore, the input `args` is likely:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

So, the input to the function `pts_to_midstep` is:
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
args = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
