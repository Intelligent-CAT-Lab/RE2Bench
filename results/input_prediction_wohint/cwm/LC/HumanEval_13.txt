The function `greatest_common_divisor` calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Given the output is 5, we need to determine the input values `a` and `b` such that their GCD is 5.

The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`) until `b` is zero. At that point, `a` is the GCD.

Let's consider possible pairs of integers that have a GCD of 5. Some examples are:
- 5 and 10: GCD(5, 10) = 5
- 15 and 10: GCD(15, 10) = 5
- 10 and 15: GCD(10, 15) = 5

However, the order of `a` and `b` does not matter for the GCD calculation because the algorithm will swap them if necessary. For instance, if we start with `a=10` and `b=15`, the first iteration will swap them to `a=15` and `b=10`.

To verify, let's simulate the algorithm for `a=10` and `b=15`:
1. Initial values: `a=10`, `b=15`
2. First iteration: `a=15`, `b=10 % 15 = 10`
3. Second iteration: `a=10`, `b=15 % 10 = 5`
4. Third iteration: `a=5`, `b=10 % 5 = 0`
5. Since `b` is now 0, the loop ends and `a=5` is returned.

Thus, the input values `a=10` and `b=15` (or vice versa) would result in an output of 5.
