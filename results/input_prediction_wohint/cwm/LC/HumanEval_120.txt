The function `maximum` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k`. If `k` is 0, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and returns the last `k` elements, which are the `k` largest numbers in the array.

Given the output [-4, 4], we need to determine the possible values of `arr` and `k`. Since the output has two elements, `k` must be 2. 

The sorted array must end with [-4, 4]. However, in a sorted array, the last elements should be the largest numbers. The presence of -4 before 4 in the output suggests that the array might not be sorted correctly, or there could be duplicate elements or negative numbers in the array.

Considering the sorted array ends with [-4, 4], possible original arrays could be [-4, 4] or any array where the last two elements after sorting are -4 and 4. For example, if the array is [-5, -4, 4], sorting it would give [-5, -4, 4], and the last two elements are -4 and 4.

However, since the function returns the last `k` elements after sorting, and the output is [-4, 4], it's likely that the original array had these two elements as the last two after sorting. 

Therefore, a possible input could be an array where the last two elements after sorting are -4 and 4, and `k` is 2.
