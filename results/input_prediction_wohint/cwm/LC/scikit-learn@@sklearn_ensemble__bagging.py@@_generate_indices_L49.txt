To predict the input of `_generate_indices`, given the output, let's analyze the function and the provided output step by step.

1. **Understanding the Function**: The `_generate_indices` function generates indices based on whether bootstrapping is enabled or not. If `bootstrap` is `True`, it uses `random_state.randint` to generate indices with replacement. If `bootstrap` is `False`, it uses `sample_without_replacement` to generate unique indices without replacement.

2. **Given Output**: The output is an array containing a single element, `[0]`. This suggests that the function generated a single index, which is `0`.

3. **Analyzing Possible Scenarios**:
    - **Bootstrap Enabled**: If `bootstrap` is `True`, the function uses `random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)`. For the output to be `[0]`, `n_samples` must be `1`, and the random state must have generated `0` as the first (and only) index.
    - **Bootstrap Disabled**: If `bootstrap` is `False`, the function uses `sample_without_replacement(n_population, n_samples, random_state=random_state)`. Similarly, for the output to be `[0]`, `n_samples` must be `1`, and the random state must have selected `0` as the index without replacement.

4. **Determining Input Parameters**:
    - Since the output is `[0]`, `n_samples` must be `1`.
    - The value of `n_population` could be any positive integer because even if `n_population` is greater than `1`, the random state could still select `0` as the index.
    - The `random_state` parameter influences the selection of indices. For simplicity, let's assume `random_state` is set to a value that would produce `0` as the index. A common choice for reproducibility is `42`, but since we're not given any specific seed, we'll keep it as is for now.
    - The `bootstrap` parameter could be either `True` or `False` since both scenarios could produce the output `[0]` under the right conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the output `[0]`, a plausible input could be when `bootstrap` is `False` (to ensure no replacement and thus a unique index), `n_population` is any positive integer (let's choose `1` for simplicity, though it could be any positive integer), `n_samples` is `1`, and `random_state` is set in a way that it selects `0` as the index.

Here's a possible input based on the analysis:
