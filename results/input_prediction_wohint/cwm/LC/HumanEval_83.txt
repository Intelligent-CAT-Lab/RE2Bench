Given the output 18000, we need to determine the value of `n` that was passed to the `starts_one_ends` function.

The function is defined as follows:
```
def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)
```

If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. However, since the output is 18000, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the function executes the second line of code: `return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)`.

Let's denote `18 * 10 ** (n - 2)` as the expression that equals 18000. To find `n`, we can solve this equation for `n`.

First, divide both sides by 18:
`10 ** (n - 2) = 1000`

Now, take the logarithm base 10 of both sides to solve for `n - 2`:
`n - 2 = log10(1000) = 3`

Add 2 to both sides to solve for `n`:
`n = 3 + 2 = 5`

Therefore, the input to the function `starts_one_ends` was `n = 5`.
