Let's break down the function `waist2rayleigh` step by step.

The function takes three inputs: `w`, `wavelen`, and `n` (with a default value of 1). The goal is to find the input values that result in the output `pi*w_0**2/l`.

1. The first step is to simplify the given output expression. The output is `pi*w_0**2/l`. This suggests that the input `wavelen` might be represented as `l` and `w` as `w_0`.

2. The function `waist2rayleigh` calculates the Rayleigh range using the formula: `w^2 * n * pi / wavelen`. Comparing this with the output expression `pi*w_0**2/l`, we can infer that:
   - `w` (input to the function) corresponds to `w_0` in the output.
   - `wavelen` (input to the function) corresponds to `l` in the output.
   - Since `n` is not present in the output expression, it must be 1 (its default value).

3. Therefore, the inputs to the function `waist2rayleigh` should be `w = w_0`, `wavelen = l`, and `n = 1`.

Now, let's construct the input in JSON format based on this analysis.

[INPUT]
{
    "w": "w_0",
    "wavelen": "l",
    "n": 1
