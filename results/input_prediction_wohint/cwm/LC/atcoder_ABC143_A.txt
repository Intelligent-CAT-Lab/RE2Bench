The output is 0, which is assigned to `ans` when the condition `ans < 0` is met. This means `A - 2 * B` must be less than 0. Let's denote `A - 2 * B` as `ans`. So, `ans = A - 2 * B < 0`. This implies `A < 2 * B`. 

To find possible values of A and B that satisfy this inequality, let's consider some examples. If B is 1, then A must be less than 2, so A could be 1 or 0. If B is 2, then A must be less than 4, so A could be 3, 2, 1, or 0. However, since A and B are integers, we need to find a pair (A, B) where A is less than 2 times B.

One possible solution is A = 1 and B = 1, because 1 - 2 * 1 = -1, which is less than 0, so `ans` would be 0. Another possible solution is A = 3 and B = 2, because 3 - 2 * 2 = -1, which is also less than 0, so `ans` would be 0.

Therefore, the input could be "1 1" or "3 2" (or any other pair where A < 2 * B).
