First, the output of `_cmp_name` is `1`. This indicates the comparison `x` is greater than `y`. 

The function `_cmp_name` is designed to compare two types `x` and `y`. If `x` and `y` have the same name, it returns `0`. If `y` is not a subclass of `Basic`, it returns `-1`. The function then compares their positions in `ordering_of_classes`. If both are unknown, it compares the names lexicographically. Otherwise, it compares their indices in the `ordering_of_classes` list.

Given the output is `1`, it implies `x` comes after `y` in the ordering. 

Possible scenarios:
1. `x` and `y` are both in `ordering_of_classes`, with `x` appearing later.
2. One or both are not in `ordering_of_classes`, and their names compare such that `x` is lexicographically greater.
3. `y` is not a subclass of `Basic`, but this would return `-1`, not `1`.

Since the output is `1`, scenario 2 or 1 is more likely. For simplicity, assume both are in `ordering_of_classes` and `x` is ordered after `y`. 

Therefore, `x` must be a type with a name that appears later in `ordering_of_classes` than `y`. For example, if `ordering_of_classes` is `['A', 'B', 'C']`, then `x` could be `C` and `y` could be `B`.
