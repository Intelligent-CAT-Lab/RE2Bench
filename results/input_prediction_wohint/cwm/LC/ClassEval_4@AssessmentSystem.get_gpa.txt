Let's analyze the function `get_gpa` step by step to determine the input that would lead to the output of `75.0`.

1. **Function `get_gpa(name)`**:
   - The function checks if a student with the given `name` exists in the `self.students` dictionary.
   - It also checks if the student has any courses (i.e., if `self.students[name]['courses']` is not empty).
   - If both conditions are met, it calculates the GPA by summing the course values and dividing by the number of courses.
   - If either condition fails (student not found or no courses), it returns `None`.

2. **Output `75.0`**:
   - The output is `75.0`, which means the GPA calculation must have resulted in this value.
   - This implies that the sum of the course values divided by the number of courses equals `75.0`.

3. **Possible Input**:
   - To achieve an average of `75.0`, the sum of the course values must be a multiple of `75.0` times the number of courses.
   - For simplicity, let's consider a scenario with one course:
     - Sum of course values = `75.0`
     - Number of courses = `1`
     - GPA = `75.0 / 1 = 75.0`
   - Another scenario could be two courses:
     - Sum of course values = `150.0`
     - Number of courses = `2`
     - GPA = `150.0 / 2 = 75.0`

4. **Student Data**:
   - The `self.students` dictionary must contain the student's name as a key.
   - The value associated with the student's name should be another dictionary with a `'courses'` key.
   - The `'courses'` value should be a dictionary where the keys are course names and the values are course scores.

5. **Example Input**:
   - Let's assume the student's name is `"John"` and they have one course with a score of `75.0`.
   - The `self.students` dictionary would look like this:
     ```python
     self.students = {
         "John": {
             "courses": {"Math": 75.0}
         }
     }
     ```
   - The input to the `get_gpa` function would be:
     ```json
     {
         "name": "John"
     }
     ```

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The input to the `get_gpa` function that would result in an output of `75.0` is the student's name `"John"` (or any other name that matches the student data in `self.students`).

Here is the predicted input:

```
{
    "name": "John"
}
