The function `check_in` is designed to handle room check-in operations for a hotel. Let's break down the logic step by step based on the provided code and the output that the function returns `null`.

1. **Initialization and Input Parameters**: 
   - The function `check_in` takes three parameters: `room_type`, `room_number`, and `name`.
   - The hotel's internal state is managed through the `booked_rooms` dictionary, which organizes bookings by room type and tracks how many rooms of each type are booked per guest.

2. **First Condition**: 
   - The first line checks if `room_type` is not in the keys of `self.booked_rooms`. If it's not present, the function immediately returns `False`. 
   - However, since the output is `null`, this condition must not have been met, implying that `room_type` exists in `self.booked_rooms`.

3. **Second Condition**:
   - The next check determines if `name` is already in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`. 
   - If `name` is not present, the function does not proceed further, but since the output is `null`, it suggests that `name` is indeed in the `booked_rooms` for the specified `room_type`.

4. **Room Number Comparison**:
   - The function then compares `room_number` with the value stored for `name` in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`.
   - If `room_number` is greater than the stored value, the function returns `False`. Since the output is `null`, this condition is not met.
   - If `room_number` equals the stored value, the function removes `name` from `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`. This could potentially result in `null` if the removal operation is successful and there's no explicit return value specified.
   - If `room_number` is less than the stored value, the function subtracts `room_number` from the stored value. Again, this might not return anything explicitly, leading to a `null` output.

Given these steps and the fact that the output is `null`, the most plausible scenario is that the function either removed a booking or adjusted the count without explicitly returning a value. 

To achieve a `null` output, the function likely executed the `elif` branch where `room_number == self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`, leading to the removal of the name from the dictionary. Since there's no explicit return statement in this branch, the function returns `null` by default.

Therefore, the input must have triggered this specific condition. Let's construct the input that would lead to this scenario:

- `room_type` must be a key in `self.booked_rooms`.
- `name` must be present in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`.
- `room_number` must equal the value stored for `name` in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`.

Assuming an initial state where `self.booked_rooms` is populated with some data, a plausible input could be:
