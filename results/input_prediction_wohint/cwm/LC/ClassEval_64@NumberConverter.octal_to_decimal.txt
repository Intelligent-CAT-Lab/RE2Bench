Let's work through this step by step. The function `octal_to_decimal` takes an octal number (base 8) and converts it to a decimal number (base 10). 

The output given is 21271 in decimal. To find the original octal input, I need to convert 21271 from decimal back to octal.

First, let's understand how to convert a decimal number to octal:
1. Divide the decimal number by 8.
2. Record the remainder.
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 8 until the quotient is 0.
4. The remainders, read in reverse order, form the octal number.

Let's apply this to 21271:

21271 ÷ 8 = 2658 with remainder 7
2658 ÷ 8 = 332 with remainder 2
332 ÷ 8 = 41 with remainder 4
41 ÷ 8 = 5 with remainder 1
5 ÷ 8 = 0 with remainder 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us 51427.

So, the original octal number must be 51427. Now, let's construct the input based on this.

The function `octal_to_decimal` is a static method, so it doesn't have an instance (`self`). It takes one argument, `octal_num`, which is the octal number as a string.

Therefore, the input should be a dictionary representing the arguments passed to `octal_to_decimal`, with the key `"args"` containing the `"octal_num"` as "51427".
