The output of `__eq__` is `true`, indicating that the two instances being compared are considered equal. To achieve this, we need to ensure that both instances are of the same concrete model type and have the same primary key value.

1. Both instances must be of the same concrete model type. This is checked by comparing `self._meta.concrete_model` with `other._meta.concrete_model`. To make this condition true, both instances should belong to the same model class.

2. The primary key (pk) values of both instances must be equal. This is checked by comparing `my_pk` (the pk of the current instance) with `other.pk` (the pk of the other instance). To make this condition true, both instances should have the same pk value.

Let's assume we have a model `MyModel` with a primary key field `id`. We create two instances of `MyModel` with the same `id` value. For example:

Instance 1: `my_instance1 = MyModel(id=1)`
Instance 2: `my_instance2 = MyModel(id=1)`

When we compare these two instances using `__eq__`, the method will return `True` because they are of the same concrete model type and have the same primary key value.
