Let's analyze the function `f` and the given output to determine the possible input.

The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `to_remove`. It converts `text` into a list called `new_text`. If `to_remove` is in `new_text`, it finds the index of `to_remove`, removes it, inserts a '?' at that index, and then removes the '?'.

Given the output is "sjbrfqmw", let's see how this could happen.

1. If `to_remove` is not in `text`, then `new_text` remains the same as `text`, and the function returns `text` as is. Therefore, if the output is "sjbrfqmw", one possible input is `text = "sjbrfqmw"` and `to_remove` is any character not in "sjbrfqmw".

2. If `to_remove` is in `text`, then the function replaces `to_remove` with '?' and then removes the '?', effectively removing `to_remove` from `text`. However, this would result in a string that is one character shorter than the original `text`. But the output "sjbrfqmw" has 8 characters, so if this were the case, the original `text` would have 9 characters, and `to_remove` would be one of those 9 characters. However, the output does not indicate any character is missing, so this scenario is less likely unless the removed character was a duplicate.

Considering the simplest scenario where `to_remove` is not in `text`, the most straightforward input would be `text = "sjbrfqmw"` and `to_remove` being any character not present in "sjbrfqmw".
