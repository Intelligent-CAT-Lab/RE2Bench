We are given the function `f` which takes an input array. Let's step through the function to see what input would produce an empty output list.

The function `f` maps each element in the input array to a string of 'n' characters of the same length. Then, it appends each of these strings to `final_output`.

Given that the output is an empty list, it implies that the `final_output` list was never appended to. This can only happen if the input array was empty. 

When the input array is empty, the `map` function will produce an empty iterator, and thus the loop over `just_ns` will not execute, leaving `final_output` as an empty list.
