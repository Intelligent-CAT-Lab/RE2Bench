Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We are given a function `__format_line_feed` in the class `HtmlUtil`. This function takes a string `text` as input and returns a string where one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`) are replaced with a single newline character.

The output of this function is given as:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Since the output doesn't contain any newline characters, it's likely that the input to the function also didn't contain any newline characters. Therefore, the input would be the same as the output.

Here's the input in the required format:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "text": "Some sentence here."
}
```
[/INPUT]
