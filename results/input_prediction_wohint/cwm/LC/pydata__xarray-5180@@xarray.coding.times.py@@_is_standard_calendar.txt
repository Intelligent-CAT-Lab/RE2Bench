To determine the input of the `_is_standard_calendar` function given the output, we need to understand what the function does. The function checks if a given calendar is a standard calendar by comparing it to a set of known standard calendars: 'standard', 'gregorian', and 'proleptic_gregorian'. It does this by converting the input calendar to lowercase and checking if it exists in the `_STANDARD_CALENDARS` set.

Given the output is `true`, it means the input calendar must be one of the standard calendars. Therefore, the input could be any of 'standard', 'gregorian', or 'proleptic_gregorian' (case-insensitive).

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "calendar": "proleptic_gregorian"
}
```
