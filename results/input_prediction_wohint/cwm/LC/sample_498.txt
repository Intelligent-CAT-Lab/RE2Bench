Let's analyze the given function and the output to predict the input.

The function `f(nums, idx, added)` does the following:
1. Inserts the value `added` at the position `idx` in the list `nums`. This is done using slice assignment: `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)`.
2. Returns the modified list `nums`.

The output is:
```
{
    "output": [
        2,
        2,
        3,
        2,
        3,
        3
    ]
}
```

From the output, we can see that the final list has 6 elements. The value `2` appears three times and the value `3` appears three times.

Let's think about how this could have happened:
- If `added` is `3`, then we must have inserted `3` at some position in a list that already contained `2` and `3`.
- If `added` is `2`, then we must have inserted `2` at some position in a list that already contained `2` and `3`.

Let's consider the case where `added` is `3`. For the output to be `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, the original list `nums` must have been `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]` and `idx` must have been `3`. Inserting `3` at index `3` would result in the list `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, which does not match the output. However, if `idx` is `2`, then inserting `3` at index `2` in `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]` would result in `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, which matches the output.

Therefore, the input must have been:
- `nums = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `idx = 2`
- `added = 3`

So, the input to the function `f` would be:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "nums": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3],
    "idx": 2,
    "added": 3
}
```
[/INPUT]

[INPUT]
```
{
    "nums": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3],
    "idx": 2,
    "added": 3
}
```
[/INPUT]
