To predict the input of `rescale_to_unit` given the output, I need to understand what the function does. The function takes a list of numbers, finds the minimum and maximum values, and then rescales each number in the list so that the minimum becomes 0.0 and the maximum becomes 1.0. This is done using the formula: (x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number).

Given the output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`, I can deduce the original list of numbers. Since the output is evenly spaced between 0.0 and 1.0, it suggests that the original list had five numbers that were evenly spaced. Let's assume the original numbers were 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. When rescaled, these would map directly to 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 respectively.

Let me verify this assumption. If the original list was `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, then:
- min_number = 0
- max_number = 4
- (0 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 0.0
- (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 0.25
- (2 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 0.5
- (3 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 0.75
- (4 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1.0

This matches the given output. Therefore, the input to the function `rescale_to_unit` must have been the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
