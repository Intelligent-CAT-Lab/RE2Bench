To predict the input of the `sum_squares` function given the output of 1086, let's analyze how the function works.

The function iterates over each element in the input list `lst`. For each element `i`, it calculates the square of the ceiling of `i` and adds this value to a running total `squared`.

Given that the final output is 1086, we need to find a combination of numbers whose ceiling squared sums up to 1086.

Let's break down 1086 into possible squares:

1. The largest square less than 1086 is 33^2 = 1089, which is too large.
2. The next largest square is 32^2 = 1024. If we use 32^2, we need to find a sum that equals 1086 - 1024 = 62 using squares of ceilings of numbers.

Looking for the next largest square that could contribute to 62:
- 8^2 = 64 is slightly larger than 62, so it's not suitable.
- 7^2 = 49. If we use 7^2, we need 62 - 49 = 13 more.
- For 13, the closest square is 4^2 = 16, which is too large. The next smaller square is 3^2 = 9. If we use 3^2, we need 13 - 9 = 4 more.
- 2^2 = 4 fits perfectly.

So, one possible combination could be the ceiling of numbers that give us 32, 7, 3, and 2 when squared. This could be achieved with numbers like 31.1 (ceiling is 32), 6.1 (ceiling is 7), 2.1 (ceiling is 3), and 1.1 (ceiling is 2).

Let's verify:
- math.ceil(31.1)^2 = 32^2 = 1024
- math.ceil(6.1)^2 = 7^2 = 49
- math.ceil(2.1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
- math.ceil(1.1)^2 = 2^2 = 4

Adding these up: 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4 = 1086

Therefore, an input list that could produce the output of 1086 is `[31.1, 6.1, 2.1, 1.1]`.
