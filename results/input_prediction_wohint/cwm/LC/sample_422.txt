Let's break down the execution step by step to determine the input that would result in the given output.

1. The function `f` takes an input `array`.
2. It creates a copy of `array` called `new_array`.
3. It reverses `new_array` using the `reversed()` function.
4. It returns a list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the reversed `new_array`.

Given the output is `[1, 4, 1]`, let's work backwards:

- The output elements are the squares of the elements in the reversed array. Therefore, the elements in the reversed array must be `1`, `2`, and `1` because:
  - $1^2 = 1$
  - $2^2 = 4$
  - $1^2 = 1$

- Since the array was reversed, the original array must have been `[1, 2, 1]`.

Therefore, the input to the function `f` would be an array containing the elements `1`, `2`, and `1`.
