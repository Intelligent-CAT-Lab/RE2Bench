The __len__ method returns the length of the _data dictionary. Since the output is 0, the _data dictionary must be empty. This can only happen if no items have been added to the CamelCaseMap instance. Therefore, the input to the __len__ method is an instance of CamelCaseMap that has just been initialized and has no data.
