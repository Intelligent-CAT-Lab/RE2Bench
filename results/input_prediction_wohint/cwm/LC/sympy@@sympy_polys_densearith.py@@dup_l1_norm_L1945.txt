1. The function `dup_l1_norm` computes the L1 norm of a polynomial's coefficients. The output is 3, so the sum of absolute values of coefficients is 3.
2. Since `dup_l1_norm` calls `K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))`, the coefficients must add up to 3.
3. Common polynomials with L1 norm 3 include coefficients like [3], [-3], [1, 2], [-1, 2], etc. We'll assume the simplest case: coefficients [3] or [-3].
4. The `dup_abs` function converts all coefficients to their absolute values, so negative coefficients become positive. Thus, if the original coefficients were [-3], `dup_abs` would return [3], and the sum would still be 3.
5. The domain `K` must support the `abs` and `sum` operations. A typical domain for this is the integers (ZZ) or rational numbers (QQ).
6. Based on the output, the polynomial could be a constant term, like 3 or -3, or a linear polynomial with coefficients summing to 3 in absolute value.

Possible input polynomials:
- f = [3], K = ZZ (integers)
- f = [-3], K = ZZ
- f = [1, 2], K = ZZ
- f = [-1, 2], K = ZZ

We'll choose the simplest case: f = [3], K = ZZ.
