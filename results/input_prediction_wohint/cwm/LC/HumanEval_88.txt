To determine the input of the `sort_array` function given the output, let's analyze the provided output and the function's behavior step by step.

1. **Understanding the Function**: The `sort_array` function takes an array as input. It checks if the array is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty list. If the array is not empty, it sorts the array in either ascending or descending order based on the condition `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0`. This condition checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.

2. **Analyzing the Output**: The output provided is `[5]`. This means the array after being processed by the `sort_array` function results in a list containing only the element `5`.

3. **Inferring the Input**:
    - Since the output is `[5]`, the input array must have contained `5` because the output is a sorted version of the input array.
    - The sorting order (ascending or descending) is determined by the condition `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0`. For a single-element array like `[5]`, `array[0]` and `array[-1]` both refer to `5`. So, `(5 + 5) % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True` because `10 % 2 == 0`. This means the array is sorted in reverse order, but since there's only one element, the order doesn't change the output.
    - Therefore, the input array must have been `[5]` to produce the output `[5]` after the sorting operation.
