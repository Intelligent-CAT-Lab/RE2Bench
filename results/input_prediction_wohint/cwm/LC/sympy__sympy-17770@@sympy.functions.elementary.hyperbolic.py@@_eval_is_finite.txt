To determine the input of `_eval_is_finite`, let's analyze the function and the given output.

The function `_eval_is_finite` checks if the argument `arg` is finite. The output indicates that this function returns `True`, meaning the argument must be finite.

In SymPy, the `is_finite` attribute is `True` for real numbers and finite expressions. Since the function returns `True`, the input argument `arg` must be a finite value.

Considering possible finite inputs, a common example is a real number like `0`, `1`, or `-1`. However, since the function is part of a hyperbolic function class, it's reasonable to assume the argument could be a symbolic expression involving hyperbolic functions or other finite values.

Given the simplicity of the function and the output, the most straightforward input would be a finite real number or a symbolic expression that evaluates to a finite value. Let's choose a simple finite number for the argument.
