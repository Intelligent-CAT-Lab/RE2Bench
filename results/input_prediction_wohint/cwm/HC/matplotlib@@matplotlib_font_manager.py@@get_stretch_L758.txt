To predict the input of `get_stretch`, we need to consider how the `FontProperties` class is initialized and how its methods set various font properties. Given the output `"normal"` from `get_stretch`, this implies that the font's stretch property is set to `"normal"`. 

The `get_stretch` method simply returns the `_stretch` attribute of the `FontProperties` instance. Therefore, for `get_stretch` to return `"normal"`, the `_stretch` attribute must be set to `"normal"`.

Looking at the `set_stretch` method, it checks if the provided `stretch` value is valid. If `stretch` is a string and exists in `stretch_dict`, it sets `self._stretch` to that value. If `stretch` is not in `stretch_dict`, it attempts to convert `stretch` to an integer and checks if it's within the valid range (0 to 1000). If it's a valid integer, it sets `self._stretch` to that integer value. However, since the output is `"normal"`, which is a string, it's likely that `"normal"` is a valid entry in `stretch_dict`.

Given this, the input to `get_stretch` would involve creating a `FontProperties` instance where the `stretch` parameter is set to `"normal"`. This could be directly in the constructor or through the `set_stretch` method.

Here's how the input might look based on this reasoning:
