To determine the input of `_convert_other`, we need to analyze the output "[2 4]".

The `_convert_other` function is a part of the `FITS_rec` class and is responsible for converting data from one format to another. The output "[2 4]" suggests that this function has successfully converted an array of integers.

Let's break down the steps to predict the input:

1. The output is an array of integers [2 4], indicating that the input was likely an array that was converted into this format.

2. The `_convert_other` function handles various data types and formats, including integers, strings, and boolean values.

3. Since the output is a simple array of integers, we can infer that the input was likely a similar array that underwent some form of scaling or transformation.

4. Looking at the code, we see that the `_convert_other` function can apply scaling factors (BSCALE and BZERO) to the input data. If the input data was scaled, we would expect the output to be the scaled version of the input.

5. To arrive at the input, we need to reverse the scaling process. If the output is [2 4] and assuming no scaling was applied (BSCALE=1 and BZERO=0), the input would be the same as the output.

However, without specific information about the scaling factors used during the conversion, we can't accurately determine the exact input. But based on the output and the function's behavior, we can make an educated guess.

Given the information provided and the nature of the `_convert_other` function, a plausible input could be an array that, when processed by this function, results in the output [2 4]. 

Since we cannot directly reverse-engineer the exact input without more details about the scaling factors or the original data type, the most straightforward assumption is that the input was already in a form that, when processed, yields the output [2 4].

Thus, a possible input could be:
