1. The function `_eval_real_imag` is evaluating whether the multiplication of its arguments results in a real or imaginary number.
2. Since the output is `True`, it implies the result is real.
3. The function checks if any of the arguments are complex, infinite, or imaginary. If any argument is imaginary, it toggles the `real` flag.
4. For extended real numbers (like infinity or negative numbers), it checks if they are zero. If any non-zero extended real number is found and all others are finite, it returns `True` (real).
5. Given the output is `True`, it's likely that all arguments are extended real numbers and none are zero or imaginary, or there's a combination that results in a real number.
6. To achieve this output, the arguments should be such that their product is real. For simplicity, let's assume all arguments are real numbers (not imaginary or complex) and at least one is non-zero if others are zero.
7. Let's assume the arguments are real numbers like `2` and `3`, which multiply to a real number `6`.
