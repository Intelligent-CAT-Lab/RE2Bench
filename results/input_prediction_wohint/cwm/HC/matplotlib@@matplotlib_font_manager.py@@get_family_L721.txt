I need to predict the input to the `get_family` method based on the output {"output": ["Helvetica"]}. 

First, let's look at the `get_family` method. It simply returns `self._family`. So, the output of `get_family` is the value of `self._family`.

The `set_family` method is responsible for setting the `_family` attribute. It takes a `family` argument, which can be a string or a list of strings. If `family` is a string, it converts it into a list containing that string. Then, it assigns this list to `self._family`.

Given that the output of `get_family` is ["Helvetica"], it means that `self._family` must be ["Helvetica"]. 

To achieve this, the input to the `FontProperties` constructor (or the `set_family` method) must have been "Helvetica" as the `family` argument. 

Therefore, the input should be a dictionary where the `family` key has the value "Helvetica".

[INPUT]
```
{
    "family": "Helvetica"
}
```
