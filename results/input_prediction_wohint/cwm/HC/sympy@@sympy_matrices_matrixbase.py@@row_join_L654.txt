1. The input to the `row_join` method produces an output matrix of shape 2x4, with values `[[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]`. This means we're joining two matrices, each with 2 rows, along their columns.

2. The `row_join` method calls `_eval_row_join`, which handles the actual concatenation. Since the first matrix has 2 columns (given that the result is 4 columns after joining), the second matrix must also have 2 columns.

3. Let's assume the first matrix is a 2x2 matrix with values `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` (identity matrix), and the second matrix is also a 2x2 matrix with values `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. When joined, this would produce the given output.

4. The `row_join` function checks if the number of rows in both matrices is the same. Here, both matrices have 2 rows, so the check passes.

5. Therefore, the input to `row_join` would be two 2x2 identity matrices.
