To determine the input of `_eval_evalf`, given the output "-0.e-1", we need to understand how `_eval_evalf` works. This function is part of the `sympy` library and is used to evaluate expressions with a certain precision.

Given that the output is "-0.e-1", which is a floating-point number, we can infer that the input to `_eval_evalf` must be an expression that, when evaluated with a specific precision, results in this value.

The expression that would evaluate to "-0.e-1" could be a simple one like `-1/(10**1)`, which is `-0.1` or in scientific notation, `-1.e-1`. This suggests that the input expression is likely related to a division or a power operation that results in this value.

However, without more specific information about the input expression, the best we can do is make an educated guess based on the output. The input could be an expression like `S.NegativeOne / 10` (where `S.NegativeOne` represents `-1` in SymPy), or it could involve more complex SymPy operations that simplify to this result.

Given the provided information and the goal to find an input that results in "-0.e-1", a plausible input could involve a simple arithmetic expression that evaluates to `-0.1`.
