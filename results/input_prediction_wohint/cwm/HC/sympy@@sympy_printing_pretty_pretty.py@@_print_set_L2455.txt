To determine the input of `_print_set`, we need to analyze the given output. The output is a `prettyForm` object that represents a set containing `Q.integer` and `Q.positive`. 

The `_print_set` method is responsible for printing sets in a pretty format. It first checks if the set is empty. If not, it sorts the items using the `default_sort_key` function and then uses the `_print_seq` method to print the items as a sequence, wrapping the result in curly braces to represent a set.

Given that the output is `prettyForm('{Q.integer, Q.positive}',0,0)`, it indicates that the input set contains two elements: `Q.integer` and `Q.positive`. These elements are likely instances of some SymPy classes that represent integers and positive integers, respectively.

The `default_sort_key` function is used to sort the items in the set. This function returns a key that can be used for sorting based on the class and value of the items. Since the output shows `Q.integer` and `Q.positive` in a specific order, we can infer that the sorting is done based on their class and value.

Therefore, the input to `_print_set` should be a set containing `Q.integer` and `Q.positive`, sorted in the order that produces the given output.
