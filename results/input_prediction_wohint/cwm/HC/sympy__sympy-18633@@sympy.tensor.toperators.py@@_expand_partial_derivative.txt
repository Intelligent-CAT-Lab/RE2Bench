To predict the input of `_expand_partial_derivative`, given the provided output `{ "_indices": null, "_free": null, "_dum": null }`, we need to reverse-engineer the execution flow of the `_expand_partial_derivative` method. 

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `_expand_partial_derivative` method is a part of the `PartialDerivative` class, which is designed to compute partial derivatives in the context of tensor expressions. This method is expected to process the expression and its variables, handling contractions and expansions as necessary.

2. **Output Analysis**: The given output suggests that after processing, the result of `_expand_partial_derivative` does not have any indices (`_indices`), free indices (`_free`), or dummy indices (`_dum`). This typically implies that the processed expression either simplifies to a scalar or has been fully contracted.

3. **Identifying Input Requirements**: For `_expand_partial_derivative` to result in an expression with no indices, the input must be such that all indices in the original expression are properly contracted. This could involve a combination of tensor multiplications and partial derivatives that ultimately cancel out all free indices.

4. **Possible Input Scenario**: Given the nature of the `PartialDerivative` class, a plausible input could involve a tensor expression where the partial derivative operation leads to a fully contracted result. For example, if we take the derivative of a tensor with respect to a variable that appears in both the tensor and its inverse or adjoint, the result could simplify to a scalar, eliminating all indices.

5. **Constructing the Input**: Since the exact tensor structure isn't specified, we can hypothesize a generic input where `self.expr` is a tensor expression that, when differentiated with respect to `self.variables`, results in a scalar. This could involve a tensor `A` with indices `i, j` differentiated with respect to another tensor or symbol that effectively contracts the `i, j` indices.

Given these considerations, a potential input could involve a simple tensor expression and its derivative, leading to a fully contracted result. However, without explicit tensor definitions, the exact input remains hypothetical.

**Predicted Input (Hypothetical Example)**:

```json
{
    "self": {
        "expr": "Tensor expression that simplifies to a scalar upon differentiation",
        "variables": "Symbols or tensors involved in the differentiation"
    }
}
```

This prediction is based on the assumption that the input expression, when differentiated, results in a fully contracted tensor or scalar, aligning with the output provided.
