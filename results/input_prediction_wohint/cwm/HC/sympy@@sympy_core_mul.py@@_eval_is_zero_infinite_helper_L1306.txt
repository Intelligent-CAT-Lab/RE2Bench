To determine the input of `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`, given the output `[false, false]`, we need to understand what this method does. The `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` method checks if any of the arguments in `self.args` are zero or infinite, returning a tuple indicating whether zero or infinite values were found.

Given the output `[false, false]`, it means that neither zero nor infinite values were found among the arguments.

Let's analyze the possible inputs:

1. **If all arguments are finite and non-zero**: The method will return `(False, False)`, which matches the given output.
2. **If there's a mix of zero and infinite values**: The method would return `(None, None)` due to the conflicting properties, which doesn't match the output.
3. **If there's a mix of finite and zero or infinite values**: Similarly, it would return `(None, None)` if there's ambiguity, which again doesn't match.

Therefore, the input must consist of arguments that are all finite and non-zero.

To simulate the execution and determine a suitable input, let's consider an example where `self` is an instance of `Mul` (a class representing multiplication operations in SymPy), and its arguments are simple, non-zero, finite numbers or expressions.

For instance, if `self` is `Mul(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are symbols or expressions that are not zero and not infinite, then calling `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` on this instance should return `(False, False)`.

Thus, a plausible input for `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` could be an instance of `Mul` with arguments that are guaranteed to be non-zero and finite.
