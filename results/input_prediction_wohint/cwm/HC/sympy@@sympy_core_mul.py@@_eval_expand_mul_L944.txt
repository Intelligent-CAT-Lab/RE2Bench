First, let's analyze the given output: "-sin(phi)**2". This suggests that the expression we're dealing with involves a trigonometric function (sin) raised to the power of 2, and there's a negative sign involved.

The method `_eval_expand_mul` is part of the `Mul` class in SymPy, which is used for multiplication operations. The purpose of this method is to expand the multiplication, especially when it involves sums or other complex expressions.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output "-sin(phi)**2" indicates that the final result involves squaring the sine of phi and applying a negative sign. This could come from multiplying two terms, one of which is -sin(phi) and the other is sin(phi), or it could be the result of simplifying a more complex expression.

2. **Analyzing `_eval_expand_mul`**: This method starts by converting the expression into a fraction (numerator and denominator) using the `fraction` function from SymPy's `radsimp` module. It then checks if the denominator is a multiplication operation (`is_Mul`), and if so, it recursively applies `_eval_expand_mul` to both the numerator and the denominator.

3. **Identifying the Input**: To produce "-sin(phi)**2", the input to `_eval_expand_mul` must be an expression that, when expanded, results in this output. Given the nature of the output, a likely candidate for the input is an expression involving the multiplication of -sin(phi) by itself.

4. **Considering the Role of `hints`**: The `hints` parameter in `_eval_expand_mul` can affect how the expansion is performed. For example, setting `exact=True` might prevent certain simplifications. However, without more specific information about the `hints` used, we'll assume a default or minimal set of hints.

5. **Predicting the Input**: Based on the output "-sin(phi)**2", a plausible input could be an expression like `-sin(phi) * sin(phi)`. When this is passed to `_eval_expand_mul`, it should expand to `-sin(phi)**2`.

6. **Constructing the Input JSON**: The input to `_eval_expand_mul` would be an instance of the `Mul` class (since it's a multiplication operation) with the arguments `-sin(phi)` and `sin(phi)`. The `hints` dictionary might be empty or contain default values.

Therefore, the input to `_eval_expand_mul` that would result in the output "-sin(phi)**2" is likely an expression representing the multiplication of -sin(phi) by sin(phi).
