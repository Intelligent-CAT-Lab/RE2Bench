To solve this problem, let's analyze the given function and its output.

The function `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative` is a method of the `Expr` class in SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics. This method is used to determine if an expression is extended positive or negative.

Given the output of the function is `false`, we need to find the input that would result in this output.

After analyzing the function, we can see that it checks if the expression is a number and if it's not, it tries to evaluate it using `evalf` method. If the evaluation fails, it returns `False`.

Based on this analysis, we can predict the input of the function.
