To find the input to the `hpack` method given the output is `None`, I need to deduce what the method does and what conditions would result in no output.

The `hpack` method appears to be responsible for packing elements horizontally. It calculates the width, height, depth, and glue properties of a container (Hlist). The method's signature is `hpack(self, w: float=0.0, m: T.Literal['additional', 'exactly']='additional') -> None`, meaning it doesn't return a value (`-> None`), which aligns with the output being `None`.

Now, let's look at how `hpack` is used in the provided code. The `Hlist` class's `__init__` method calls `hpack` after optionally calling `kern`. The `hpack` method calculates the dimensions of the list based on its children and the parameters `w` and `m`.

Given the output is `None`, I need to determine what inputs would result in no return value (which is always the case for `hpack` since it returns `None`). The actual task is to predict the input parameters to `hpack`.

Looking at the `Hlist` class's `__init__` method:
- It initializes `Hlist` with `elements`, `w`, `m`, and `do_kern`.
- If `do_kern` is `True`, it calls `kern`.
- It then calls `hpack` with `w` and `m`.

Therefore, to find the input to `hpack`, we need to look at how `Hlist` is instantiated and what parameters are passed to its constructor.

Assuming the output `None` is from an `Hlist` instantiation that triggers `hpack`, we need to deduce the parameters passed to `Hlist`'s constructor.

However, since the actual task is to predict the input to `hpack` directly, and considering `hpack` is called with `w` and `m` parameters from the `Hlist` constructor, we can infer that the inputs to `hpack` are the `w` and `m` values passed to the `Hlist` constructor.

Given that the output is `None`, which is the return value of `hpack`, we need to consider the possible inputs that would lead to this method being called. Since `hpack` always returns `None`, any valid input to `hpack` would result in `None` being returned.

Therefore, the input to `hpack` would be the `w` and `m` parameters passed to it when it's called. Without specific information about the `Hlist` instance being created, we can't determine the exact values of `w` and `m`, but we know they are passed from the `Hlist` constructor.

However, since we need to provide a specific input that results in the given output (`None`), and considering the method signature and usage, a plausible input could be the default values for `w` and `m` if they are not explicitly provided.

But to strictly follow the instructions and provide an answer based on the given information, we should focus on the fact that `hpack` is called without any parameters (using defaults) in the context where `Hlist` is initialized with default parameters for `w` and `m`.

Thus, the input to `hpack` would be the default values for `w` and `m`, which are `0.0` and `'additional'`, respectively.
