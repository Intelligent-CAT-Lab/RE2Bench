Let's analyze the given output to figure out the input for the `_find_reasonable_pivot` function.

The output is a tuple `(0, "-9", False, [])`. According to the function's logic, this indicates:
1. The index of the pivot element is `0`.
2. The pivot element itself is `-9`.
3. `False` suggests that the element at the pivot index is not undetermined or undefined (i.e., the function didn't need to resort to further simplification or checks).
4. The empty list `[]` means no additional elements were determined as zeros during the process.

Given this, the input column `col` must contain `-9` as the first element. Since the function checks if all elements in the column are instances of `Float` or `Integer` and if any are `Float`, we can infer that the column is composed entirely of numeric values (likely integers or floats), with `-9` being the first one. 

The function `_iszero` checks if an element is zero. Since the pivot element is `-9`, which is not zero, the check in the function's first block (if all elements are numeric and any are float) should have passed, leading directly to the return of `(0, -9, False, [])`.

Therefore, the input to `_find_reasonable_pivot` would be a list containing at least `-9` as the first element, possibly followed by other numeric values. For simplicity, we'll assume the list is just `[-9]`.
