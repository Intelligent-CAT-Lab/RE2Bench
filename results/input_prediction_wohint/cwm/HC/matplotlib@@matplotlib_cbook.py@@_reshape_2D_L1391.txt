To predict the input of `_reshape_2D`, I need to analyze the output and work backwards. The output shows an array of three numpy arrays, each containing five elements. This suggests that the input to `_reshape_2D` was a 2D array (or a list of lists) with three rows and five columns.

1. The function `_reshape_2D` transposes the input array `X` if it's a numpy array. This means that if the original input was a 2D numpy array with shape (3, 5), after transposing, it becomes (5, 3). However, the output lists three arrays, each with five elements, which aligns with the transposed shape.

2. The function then checks the dimensions of `X`. Since the transposed array has two dimensions (5, 3), it proceeds to reshape each row into a 1D array. This results in three 1D arrays, each with five elements, which matches the output.

3. Therefore, the input to `_reshape_2D` must have been a 2D array (or a list of lists) with three rows and five columns. Given that the output arrays contain floating-point numbers, it's likely that the input was a numpy array of floats.

4. To confirm, I'll consider the possibility that the input was a list of lists or a pandas DataFrame, but since the output is numpy arrays, it's more likely that the input was a numpy array.

5. Based on this analysis, the input to `_reshape_2D` was a numpy array with shape (3, 5) containing floating-point numbers.
