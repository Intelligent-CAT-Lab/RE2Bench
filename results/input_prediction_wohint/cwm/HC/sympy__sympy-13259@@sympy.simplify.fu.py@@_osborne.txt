I need to find the input to the `_osborne` function that would produce the given output. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the `_osborne` function**:
   - The function `_osborne(e, d)` takes an expression `e` and a factor `d`, and it converts hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `coth`, `sech`, `csch`) into trigonometric functions multiplied by `I` (the imaginary unit) or divided by `I`, depending on the specific hyperbolic function.
   - It uses the `bottom_up` function to apply a transformation to each node in the expression tree.

2. **Analyzing the output**:
   - The output is `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x) + I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)`.
   - This suggests that the original expression contained hyperbolic functions that were converted using the `_osborne` function.
   - Specifically, the terms involve `sin` and `cos` multiplied by `I`, which implies that the original hyperbolic functions could have been `sinh` or `cosh`.

3. **Identifying possible hyperbolic functions in the input**:
   - Looking at the output terms:
     - `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x)` could have come from `-sinh(_Dummy_196*x)` because `_osborne` converts `sinh(a)` to `I*sin(a)`.
     - `I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)` could have come from `I*cosh(_Dummy_196*x)*tanh(_Dummy_196*x)`, but `tanh(a)` converts to `I*tan(a)`, so this might not fit directly. Alternatively, it could involve a combination of `cosh` and another function.

4. **Considering the transformation rules**:
   - `sinh(a)` → `I*sin(a)`
   - `cosh(a)` → `cos(a)`
   - `tanh(a)` → `I*tan(a)`
   - `coth(a)` → `cot(a)/I`
   - `sech(a)` → `sec(a)`
   - `csch(a)` → `csc(a)/I`

5. **Reversing the transformation**:
   - To get `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x)`, the original term might have been `-sinh(_Dummy_196*x)` because `_osborne` would convert `sinh` to `I*sin`.
   - For `I*cos(_Dummy_196*x)*tan(_Dummy_196*x)`, since `cos` comes from `cosh`, and `tan` comes from `tanh`, but the `I` factor suggests a combination. However, `I*cos(a)*tan(a)` doesn't directly map to a single hyperbolic function transformation. It's possible that this term is a product of two transformed hyperbolic functions, or there might be a different combination.

6. **Considering the factor `d`**:
   - The factor `d` is used to multiply the argument of the hyperbolic functions. If the output involves `_Dummy_196*x`, then the input might have involved a symbol or expression that, when multiplied by `d`, results in `_Dummy_196*x`. However, without knowing the value of `d`, it's challenging to determine the exact input. But since the output uses `_Dummy_196*x`, it's possible that `d` is 1, or the input expression already included the `_Dummy_196` symbol.

7. **Constructing the input**:
   - Given the output, a possible input could be an expression involving `sinh` and `cosh` (or other hyperbolic functions) that, when transformed by `_osborne`, results in the given output.
   - For example, if the input was `-sinh(_Dummy_196*x) + cosh(_Dummy_196*x)*tanh(_Dummy_196*x)`, applying `_osborne` with `d=1` would convert `sinh` to `I*sin`, `cosh` to `cos`, and `tanh` to `I*tan`, resulting in `-I*sin(_Dummy_196*x) + cos(_Dummy_196*x)*I*tan(_Dummy_196*x)`, which matches the output.

8. **Finalizing the input**:
   - Based on the analysis, the input to `_osborne` could be an expression like `-sinh(_Dummy_196*x) + cosh(_Dummy_196*x)*tanh(_Dummy_196*x)`, and the factor `d` would be 1.
