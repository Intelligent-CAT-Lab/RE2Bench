Let's analyze the problem step by step. We are given a function `switch_backend` and its output, which is `null`. We need to determine what the input to `switch_backend` could be.

1. **Understanding the function `switch_backend`**: This function changes the backend used by Matplotlib. The backend determines how Matplotlib interacts with the system, whether it's rendering plots in a window, saving them to files, or other operations.

2. **Given output**: The output is `null`, which suggests that the function executed successfully without returning any value (since Python functions return `None` by default if no explicit return statement is encountered).

3. **Possible inputs**: The function `switch_backend` takes a single argument, `newbackend`, which is a string representing the name of the backend to switch to. Common backends include 'agg', 'pdf', 'svg', 'TkAgg', 'Qt5Agg', etc.

4. **Determining the input**: Since the output is `null` (or `None` in Python), it indicates that the function completed its execution without errors. This could happen if the specified backend exists and was successfully loaded.

5. **Conclusion**: Without more specific information about the environment or the exact backend being used, the most likely input is a valid backend name that Matplotlib can load. A common and safe default backend is 'agg', which is a non-interactive backend that can generate plots and save them to files without displaying them in a window.

Therefore, the input to `switch_backend` is likely `'agg'`.
