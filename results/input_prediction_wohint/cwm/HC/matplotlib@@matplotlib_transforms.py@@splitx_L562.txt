To solve this problem, we need to analyze the provided output and deduce the input that would lead to it.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is a list of three `Bbox` objects, representing bounding boxes. Each `Bbox` object is defined by two points, which can be interpreted as opposite corners of a rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the `Bbox` Objects**:
   - The first `Bbox` is `Bbox([[0.125, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]])`. This suggests a rectangle with lower-left corner at `(0.125, 0.09999999999999998)` and upper-right corner at `(0.78375, 0.9)`.
   - The second `Bbox` is `Bbox([[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.78375, 0.9]])`, representing a vertical line segment at `x=0.78375` from `y=0.09999999999999998` to `y=0.9`.
   - The third `Bbox` is `Bbox([[0.78375, 0.09999999999999998], [0.9, 0.9]])`, suggesting a rectangle with lower-left corner at `(0.78375, 0.09999999999999998)` and upper-right corner at `(0.9, 0.9)`.

3. **Inferring the Input**: 
   - The function `splitx` takes in a variable number of arguments (`*args`) and splits the bounding box into smaller bounding boxes based on the `x` coordinate. 
   - Given the output, it seems the original bounding box was split into three parts: one from the left edge to `x=0.78375`, another exactly at `x=0.78375`, and the last from `x=0.78375` to the right edge.
   - The arguments passed to `splitx` likely include the `x` coordinate `0.78375`, as this is where the splits occur.

4. **Determining the Original Bounding Box**:
   - The original bounding box's extents (from the first `Bbox` object) are approximately `(0.125, 0.09999999999999998, 0.78375, 0.9)`. However, since the split occurs at `x=0.78375`, and considering the third `Bbox` extends to `x=0.9`, the original bounding box likely extended to `x=0.9`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The input to `splitx` likely includes the original bounding box and the `x` coordinate(s) at which to split. Given the provided output, one of the split points is `0.78375`.

Therefore, the input to `splitx` can be inferred as follows:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "extents": [0.125, 0.09999999999999998, 0.9, 0.9]
    },
    "args": [0.78375]
}
```
