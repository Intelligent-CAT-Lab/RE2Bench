1. The given output is the `func` object passed to the `dec` function. We need to determine what `func` would have looked like before being wrapped by `dec`.
2. The `dec` function is a decorator created by `simple_tag`. It modifies the original function `func` by adding attributes and wrapping it in another function `compile_func`.
3. Looking at the output, `func` has been wrapped by `dec` (as seen from the `__wrapped__` attribute). The original `func` would not have this attribute.
4. The original `func` should be similar to the one in the output but without the attributes added by `dec`. Specifically, it should not have the `__wrapped__` attribute.
5. Therefore, the input to `dec` would be a function object similar to the output but without the `__wrapped__` attribute and possibly other attributes that `dec` adds.

Here's the predicted input:
