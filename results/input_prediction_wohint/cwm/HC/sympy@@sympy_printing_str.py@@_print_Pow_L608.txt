Okay, I need to figure out what input would result in the output "sqrt(2)" for the `_print_Pow` method. Let's start by looking at the code for `_print_Pow`. 

The method checks if the exponent is S.Half (which represents 1/2 or a square root) and if it's not a rational expression. If so, it returns 'sqrt(base)'. 

So, for the output to be 'sqrt(2)', the base of the power expression must be 2, and the exponent must be S.Half. 

Let me check the properties of `Pow` objects. The `base` property returns the base (args[0]) and `exp` returns the exponent (args[1]). 

Therefore, the input to `_print_Pow` should be a `Pow` object where `expr.base` is 2 and `expr.exp` is S.Half. 

Now, I need to construct such an input. The `Pow` class is from `sympy.core.power`, so the input should be an instance of `Pow` with the correct base and exponent.
