We are given the output of the `_hstack` method, which is a 2D NumPy array `array([[-1., -1.,  2.], [ 1.,  1.,  5.]])`. To determine the input to `_hstack`, we need to work backward through the code.

1. **Understanding `_hstack`:** The `_hstack` method takes a list of 2D arrays (`Xs`) and stacks them horizontally. If `self.sparse_output_` is `True`, it converts all elements to sparse arrays and uses `sparse.hstack`. Otherwise, it converts sparse arrays to dense using `toarray()` and then uses `np.hstack`.

2. **Given Output:** The output is a dense array, so we know `self.sparse_output_` must be `False`. The output has 2 rows and 3 columns, implying that the input list `Xs` contains three 2D arrays, each with 2 rows and 1 column.

3. **Possible Input:** Let's denote the input arrays as `A`, `B`, and `C`, where each is a 2x1 array. For example:
   - `A = array([[-1.], [1.]])`
   - `B = array([[-1.], [1.]])`
   - `C = array([[2.], [5.]])`

   When stacked horizontally, these would produce the given output.

4. **Verification:** To confirm, we check if `_hstack` would produce the given output when given these inputs. Since `self.sparse_output_` is `False`, it converts any sparse arrays to dense and uses `np.hstack`. Assuming `A`, `B`, and `C` are dense, `np.hstack([A, B, C])` would indeed produce the output array.

5. **Conclusion:** The input to `_hstack` is a list of three 2D arrays, each with 2 rows and 1 column, which when stacked horizontally produce the given output.
