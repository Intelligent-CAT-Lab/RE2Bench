I need to find the input to the `extract` method given the output. Let's break down the problem.

First, let's understand what the `extract` method does. The method takes `rows` and `cols` as input and returns a new `SDM` object with the specified rows and columns extracted from the original matrix.

The output provided is:
```
{
    "0": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "1": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "2": {
        "0": 1
    }
}
```

This is a sparse matrix where each row has a single non-zero element at column 0 with the value 1. The matrix has 3 rows and 1 column.

Let's think about the possible inputs that could produce this output.

1. The original matrix must have at least 3 rows and 1 column.
2. The `rows` argument must be such that it extracts the first 3 rows of the original matrix.
3. The `cols` argument must be such that it extracts the first column of the original matrix.

Now, let's think about the `extract` method's logic. It creates a new sparse matrix by iterating over the specified rows and columns. If the original matrix has a non-zero element at the specified row and column, it is included in the new matrix.

Given the output, it seems that the original matrix had non-zero elements at positions (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0) with the value 1. 

So, the input to the `extract` method could be:

- `rows`: [0, 1, 2]
- `cols`: [0]

But we need to find the original matrix and the `rows` and `cols` arguments that would produce this output.

Let's assume the original matrix is:
```
{
    "0": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "1": {
        "0": 1
    },
    "2": {
        "0": 1
    }
}
```

And the `rows` and `cols` arguments are [0, 1, 2] and [0], respectively.

However, we need to consider the possibility that the original matrix had more rows or columns, but the `extract` method only extracted the first 3 rows and the first column.

Another possibility is that the original matrix had the same structure as the output, and the `rows` and `cols` arguments were [0, 1, 2] and [0], respectively.

Let's try to find the input by considering the `extract` method's code.

The `extract` method first checks if the input matrix is empty or if the `rows` or `cols` arguments are empty. If so, it returns a new empty matrix.

Then, it checks if the `rows` and `cols` arguments are within the valid range of the original matrix's dimensions.

After that, it creates two dictionaries, `rowmap` and `colmap`, to map the original row and column indices to the new indices.

It then iterates over the original matrix's non-zero elements and includes them in the new matrix if they are within the specified `rows` and `cols`.

Given the output, it seems that the original matrix had non-zero elements at positions (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0) with the value 1.

So, the input to the `extract` method could be:

- `self`: The original matrix with non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0) with the value 1.
- `rows`: [0, 1, 2]
- `cols`: [0]

But we need to find the exact input that would produce the given output.

Let's consider the possibility that the original matrix had more rows or columns, but the `extract` method only extracted the first 3 rows and the first column.

For example, the original matrix could be:
```
{
    "0": {
        "0": 1,
        "1": 0
    },
    "1": {
        "0": 1,
        "1": 0
    },
    "2": {
        "0": 1,
        "1": 0
    },
    "3": {
        "0": 0,
        "1": 0
    }
}
```

And the `rows` and `cols` arguments are [0, 1, 2] and [0], respectively.

In this case, the `extract` method would return the given output.

However, we need to find the exact input that would produce the given output.
