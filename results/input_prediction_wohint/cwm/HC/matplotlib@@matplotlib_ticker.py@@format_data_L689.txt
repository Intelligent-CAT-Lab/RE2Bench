To determine the input value of `format_data` that would produce the output "1.1e-1", we need to reverse-engineer the function's logic.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output "1.1e-1" suggests that the function has formatted a number into a string using scientific notation. The significand is 1.1, and the exponent is -1.

2. **Significand Calculation**: The significand is calculated by dividing the input value by 10 raised to the power of the exponent. Since the significand is 1.1, we can infer that the input value divided by 10^(-1) equals 1.1. Therefore, the input value is 1.1 * 10^(-1) = 0.11.

3. **Exponent Calculation**: The exponent is determined by taking the floor of the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the input. For the input value 0.11, the base-10 logarithm is approximately -0.958, and the floor of this value is -1. This aligns with the exponent in the output.

4. **Formatting Options**: The function's formatting options, such as using offset, MathText, or locale, do not affect the core calculation of the significand and exponent. However, since the output uses "e" for the exponent, it indicates that MathText or TeX formatting is not enabled.

Given these considerations, the input value to `format_data` that would produce the output "1.1e-1" is 0.11.
