Let's analyze the problem step by step to determine the input to the `make_blobs` function that results in the given output.

1. **Understanding the Output:**
   - The output is a tuple containing two arrays: `X` and `y`.
   - `X` is a 2D numpy array where each row represents a sample with `n_features` dimensions.
   - `y` is a 1D numpy array representing the labels of the samples.

2. **Analyzing the Data:**
   - The `X` array has 50 samples (rows) and 2 features (columns).
   - The `y` array has 50 labels, indicating that there are 3 clusters (since the labels are 0, 1, and 2).

3. **Default Parameters of `make_blobs`:**
   - `n_samples`: The total number of points equally divided among clusters. Default is 100.
   - `n_features`: The number of features for each sample. Default is 2.
   - `centers`: The number of centers to generate, or the fixed center locations. Default is 3.
   - `cluster_std`: The standard deviation of the clusters. Default is 1.0.
   - `center_box`: The bounding box for the centers. Default is (-10.0, 10.0).
   - `shuffle`: Whether to shuffle the samples. Default is True.
   - `random_state`: The seed of the random number generator. Default is None.

4. **Matching the Output to the Parameters:**
   - Since `X` has 50 samples and `y` has 3 unique labels, we can infer that `n_samples` is likely 50 and `centers` (or `n_centers`) is 3.
   - The `n_features` is 2, which matches the default, so it might not be explicitly set.
   - The values in `X` suggest that the clusters are centered around different points, but without knowing the exact centers, we can't determine `center_box` or `centers` precisely. However, since the default `center_box` is (-10.0, 10.0) and the values in `X` fall within this range, it's reasonable to assume the default `center_box` was used.
   - The `cluster_std` might be the default 1.0, but since the spread of the data points varies, it's possible that `cluster_std` was set to a specific value. However, without more information, we'll assume the default.
   - `shuffle` is True by default, which would shuffle the samples, but since the output is already shuffled, we can't be sure if it was explicitly set or not.
   - `random_state` is crucial for reproducibility. The output suggests a specific random seed was used to generate the data.

5. **Determining the Random State:**
   - To reproduce the exact output, we need to know the `random_state` used. Since the problem doesn't provide it directly, we'll have to infer it based on the output.
   - One approach is to run `make_blobs` with different `random_state` values until we get a match. However, this is not practical here.
   - Another approach is to look for patterns in the data that could indicate the seed. For example, the first few samples might give a clue, but without more context, it's challenging.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the information, the most likely input parameters are `n_samples=50`, `centers=3`, and a specific `random_state`. The other parameters are likely at their defaults.
   - The exact `random_state` is crucial but not provided in the problem statement. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume a `random_state` that could produce the given output.

Therefore, the input to `make_blobs` would be something like:
