The output of `as_content_primitive` is `(1, sqrt(2))`. This suggests that the input to `as_content_primitive` is an expression where the content (the rational factor) is 1, and the primitive part is `sqrt(2)`.

Looking at the code for `as_content_primitive` in the `Pow` class, we see that it calls `self.as_base_exp()` to get the base and exponent, and then processes them to extract the content and primitive parts.

Given the output `(1, sqrt(2))`, it's likely that the input to `as_content_primitive` is `sqrt(2)`, which is an instance of the `Pow` class. When `as_content_primitive` is called on `sqrt(2)`, it returns `(1, sqrt(2))` because `sqrt(2)` is already in its simplest form with no rational content to extract.

Therefore, the input to `as_content_primitive` is likely an instance of `Pow` with base `2` and exponent `1/2`, representing `sqrt(2)`.
