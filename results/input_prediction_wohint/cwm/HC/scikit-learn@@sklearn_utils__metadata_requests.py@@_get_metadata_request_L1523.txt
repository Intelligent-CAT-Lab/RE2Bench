Let's analyze the given output and function code to determine the input for `_get_metadata_request`.

The output is:
```
{
    "output": "{'fit': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'transform': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'inverse_transform': {'sample_weight': None, 'metadata': None}}"
}
```

This suggests that the `_get_metadata_request` method is generating a metadata request object that contains specific settings for methods like `fit`, `transform`, and `inverse_transform`. The settings include whether `sample_weight` and `metadata` are requested.

Looking at the code for `_get_metadata_request`:

1. If the instance has a `_metadata_request` attribute, it uses `get_routing_for_object` to get the requests.
2. If not, it creates a new `MetadataRequest` object and sets attributes for each method in `SIMPLE_METHODS` using `_get_class_level_metadata_request_values`.

The `_get_class_level_metadata_request_values` method checks the method's signature and class-level metadata request attributes to determine which parameters to request.

Given the output, it seems that the class has specific metadata request settings for `fit`, `transform`, and possibly other methods. For example, `fit` and `transform` request `sample_weight` and `metadata`, while `inverse_transform` does not request these explicitly (hence `None`).

To produce this output, the input to `_get_metadata_request` must be an instance of a class that has these specific metadata request settings defined at the class level. The instance itself might not have a `_metadata_request` attribute, so the method proceeds to create a new `MetadataRequest` object based on the class-level settings.

Therefore, the input to `_get_metadata_request` is likely an instance of a class that defines these metadata request settings. The exact class name isn't provided, but based on the output, we can infer that it's a class used in a machine learning context, possibly from scikit-learn, given the method names like `fit`, `transform`, and `inverse_transform`.

The input would be an instance of such a class, and the method `_get_metadata_request` is called on this instance to generate the metadata request object as shown in the output.
