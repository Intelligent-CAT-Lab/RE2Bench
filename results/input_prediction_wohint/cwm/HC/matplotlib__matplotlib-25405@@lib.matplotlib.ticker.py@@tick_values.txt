Okay, let's figure out the inputs for the `tick_values` method. The output given is [1.e-02 1.e-01 1.e+00 1.e+01 1.e+02 1.e+03]. This looks like a logarithmic scale with base 10. 

First, I need to determine the `vmin` and `vmax` values. The smallest value here is 1.e-02 (0.01) and the largest is 1.e+03 (1000). So likely `vmin=0.01` and `vmax=1000`.

Next, the locator is a `LogLocator`. Let's recall how `LogLocator` works. It uses a base (default 10 for log10) and determines the ticks based on that. The output suggests the base is 10. 

The `numticks` parameter determines how many ticks to generate. The output has 6 ticks, so `numticks` might be set to 6, or if it's 'auto', the axis's tick space would determine it. But since the output is exactly 6, maybe `numticks=6` or the axis's tick space is 6.

Another important parameter is `_subs`. This determines the subdivisions within each decade. The output includes 1.e-02 (0.01), 1.e-01 (0.1), 1.e+00 (1), etc. These are the major ticks at each order of magnitude. The `_subs` could be 'auto', which would generate these major ticks. Alternatively, if `_subs` is an array like [1.0], it would still generate the same result. But if `_subs` had more elements, like [1, 2, 5], it would create more ticks. Since the output only has the major ticks, `_subs` is likely 'auto' or [1.0].

Now, let's think about the `LogLocator` instance. The `axis` parameter might be None, so `numticks` defaults to 9 unless specified. But in this case, the output has 6 ticks, so maybe `numticks` is explicitly set to 6.

Putting this all together, the inputs to `tick_values` would be `vmin=0.01`, `vmax=1000`, and the `LogLocator` instance has `numticks=6`, `base=10`, and `_subs='auto'` or `[1.0]`.

But wait, the `LogLocator` class's `tick_values` method also considers the axis's tick space if `numticks` is 'auto'. However, since the output has exactly 6 ticks, maybe `numticks` is set to 6 explicitly.

Another thing to check: the `raise_if_exceeds` method is called at the end, which ensures that the ticks don't exceed `vmin` and `vmax`. The output ticks are within the range, so that's fine.

So, the final inputs would be `vmin=0.01`, `vmax=1000`, and the `LogLocator` instance configured with `numticks=6`, `base=10`, and `_subs='auto'` or `[1.0]`.
