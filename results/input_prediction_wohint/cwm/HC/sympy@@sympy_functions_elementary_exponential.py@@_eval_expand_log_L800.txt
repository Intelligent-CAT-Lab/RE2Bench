To predict the input of `_eval_expand_log`, let's analyze the given function and the provided output.

The `_eval_expand_log` function is a method of the `log` class in SymPy. It's used to expand logarithmic expressions. The output given is `log(5)`, which suggests that the input to the `_eval_expand_log` method should be an expression that, when expanded, results in `log(5)`.

Let's consider the possible inputs:

1. If the input is already `log(5)`, then the function would simply return `log(5)` as it is.
2. If the input is `exp(log(5))`, then the function would simplify it to `5`.
3. If the input is `log(exp(5))`, then the function would simplify it to `5`.

However, in all these cases, the output is not `log(5)`. We need to find an input that, when expanded, results in `log(5)`.

One possible input is `log(5)`, but as mentioned earlier, the function would simply return `log(5)` in this case.

Another possible input is `exp(log(5))`, but the output would be `5`, not `log(5)`.

After analyzing the function and the provided output, we can conclude that the input must be `log(5)`.
