To predict the input of `_osbornei` given the output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)`, let's work backward.

The function `_osbornei(e, d)` applies a transformation to a given expression `e` with a specific variable `d`. It replaces trigonometric functions with their hyperbolic counterparts in the form of `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, etc., under certain transformations involving `I` (the imaginary unit).

Given the output `-I*tanh(x + I*z)`, we can deduce the following:

1. The original expression likely involves `tan` or `cot` since `tanh` and `coth` are their hyperbolic counterparts.
2. The argument of `tanh` is `x + I*z`, suggesting that `x` and `z` are involved in the original trigonometric function's argument.
3. The presence of `-I` outside `tanh` indicates that the original function might have been `cot` or another trigonometric function that, when transformed, introduces a factor of `-I`.

Considering these points, a plausible original expression could be `cot(x, z)`, where `z` is the variable `d` in the `_osbornei` function. This is because `cot` transforms into `coth` (which involves a factor of `I` in its transformation), and the argument `x + I*z` fits the transformation pattern observed.

Thus, the input to `_osbornei` could be an expression involving `cot` with arguments `x` and `z`, where `z` is the variable `d` that gets replaced during the transformation.
