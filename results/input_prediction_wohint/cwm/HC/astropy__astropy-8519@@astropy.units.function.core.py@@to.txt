We need to find the input of the `to` method given that the output is 100.0. The `to` method is part of a class `FunctionUnitBase` that seems to handle unit conversions. 

First, let's understand how the `to` method works. It appears to convert a value from one unit to another. The method checks if the target unit is equivalent to the current unit. If they are equivalent, it converts the value directly. If not, it tries to convert through physical units, and if that fails, it may raise an exception or provide additional error messages.

Given that the output is 100.0, we can infer that the input value was converted to this output value using the `to` method. Since we don't have information about the units involved, we'll have to make some assumptions.

Let's consider a simple scenario where the input value is 100.0 in a unit that can be directly converted to another unit, resulting in the same numerical value but with a different unit. For example, if the input is 100.0 in a unit that is equivalent to the output unit, the conversion would result in 100.0.

However, without specific details about the units, we can't pinpoint the exact input. But we can make an educated guess based on common unit conversions.

One possibility is that the input value was 100.0 in a unit that, when converted to the target unit, results in 100.0. For instance, converting 100.0 meters to kilometers would result in 0.1 kilometers, but if we're converting within the same unit family (e.g., meters to centimeters), the numerical value would change.

Given the lack of specific unit information, let's assume a scenario where the input value is 100.0 in a unit that directly converts to the output unit without changing the numerical value. This could be a unitless conversion or a conversion within the same unit system.

Therefore, the input of the `to` method could be a `FunctionQuantity` object with a value of 100.0 and a unit that can be directly converted to the target unit.
