1. The output is a masked array with data [1., 2.] and no mask. This suggests the function returned a numpy.ma.array object.
2. Looking at the code, if `n_components > 1` and `len(data) == n_components`, the function reconstructs a structured array. However, in this case, the output doesn't have a structured dtype, so this path is unlikely.
3. Another path is when the input data is a complex numpy array. Since the output has a simple dtype (float), this path is also unlikely unless the original data was complex and got converted.
4. The most likely scenario is that `n_components == 1`. In this case, the function simply returns the input data as is.
5. Given the output is a masked array with data [1., 2.], the input data must have been this array, and `n_components` must be 1.
