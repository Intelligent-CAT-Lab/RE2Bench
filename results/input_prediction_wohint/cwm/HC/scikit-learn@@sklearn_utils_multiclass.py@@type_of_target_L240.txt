Step 1: Understand the goal - Predict the input `y` that would result in the `type_of_target` function returning `"binary"`.

Step 2: Recall the function's logic - The function classifies the target type based on its structure and values. For "binary", it expects a single class with two distinct values (usually 0 and 1), or a binary array.

Step 3: Identify key conditions for "binary":
- The target `y` must have only one unique value if it's a 1D array, or two unique values if it's a 2D array with one feature.
- The values must be integers or booleans.
- If floating-point, they must be integral (e.g., 0.0 and 1.0).

Step 4: Construct a sample input `y` that meets these criteria. A simple binary classification case would be an array with two classes, 0 and 1.

Step 5: Ensure the input is valid for the function - It should be array-like (e.g., a list or numpy array) and not a string or other unsupported type.

Step 6: Formulate the input in JSON format as required.
