To solve this problem, I need to understand how the `world_to_pixel_values` function works and what inputs it expects. The function takes in world coordinates and converts them to pixel coordinates based on a WCS (World Coordinate System) projection.

1. **Understanding the Output**: The provided output is `["-2.9416469260468148e-12", "-7.123190925995004e-13"]`, which are very small negative values. This suggests that the world coordinates being converted are very close to the origin of the pixel coordinates, or perhaps there is some distortion in the WCS that leads to these small negative values.

2. **WCS Functionality**: The `world_to_pixel_values` function relies on the WCS projection to perform the conversion. It uses the `all_world2pix` method of the WCS object, which handles the conversion from world to pixel coordinates. This method might involve some distortion corrections if the WCS has distortion parameters defined.

3. **Input Requirements**: The `world_to_pixel_values` function expects world coordinates as input. These coordinates are typically in a format that the WCS understands, such as celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination) or other coordinate systems depending on the WCS setup.

4. **Hypothesizing the Input**: Given the small negative values in the output, a plausible hypothesis is that the input world coordinates are very close to the origin of the pixel coordinate system. For example, if the WCS is set up such that the origin of the world coordinates corresponds to a specific pixel, then world coordinates near this origin could result in pixel coordinates close to zero.

5. **Predicting the Input**: Let's assume a simple case where the input world coordinates are near the origin. For instance, if the WCS is a simple celestial WCS with no distortion, the input might be something like `["0", "0"]` (assuming the first two dimensions are right ascension and declination). However, given the negative values in the output, it's possible that the input coordinates are slightly negative, causing the pixel coordinates to be negative as well due to the WCS transformation.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided output and understanding of WCS conversions, a reasonable prediction for the input to `world_to_pixel_values` could be world coordinates that are very close to the origin, potentially with slight negative values. This would result in the small negative pixel coordinates observed in the output.
