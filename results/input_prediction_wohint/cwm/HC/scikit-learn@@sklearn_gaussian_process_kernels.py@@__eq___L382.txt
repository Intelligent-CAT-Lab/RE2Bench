To solve this problem, let's analyze the `__eq__` method in the `Kernel` class. The `__eq__` method checks if two kernel objects are equal by comparing their parameters. Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. The `__eq__` method first checks if the types of the two objects are the same. If not, it immediately returns `False`.
2. If the types are the same, it calls the `get_params` method on both objects to get their parameters.
3. It then compares the parameters of the two objects. If any parameter is different, it returns `False`.
4. If all parameters are the same, it returns `True`.

Given that the output of the `__eq__` method is `True`, we can infer that the two kernel objects being compared have the same type and parameters.

Now, let's consider the possible inputs to the `__eq__` method. Since the output is `True`, the inputs must be two kernel objects of the same type with the same parameters.

Here's a possible input:
