1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is a 2x2 confusion matrix `[[9 0], [0 11]]`, indicating that there are 9 true positives, 0 false positives, 0 false negatives, and 11 true negatives.
   
2. **Classifying the Problem**: Since the confusion matrix is a square matrix with each element representing the count of predictions, this suggests a binary classification problem. The `y_true` and `y_pred` are the actual and predicted labels, respectively.

3. **Determining `y_true` and `y_pred`**: For a binary classification problem, the actual labels (`y_true`) and predicted labels (`y_pred`) must have the same number of elements, and their values should be the same two categories. Let's assume the categories are 0 and 1. 

   - The total number of samples is 20 (9 + 0 + 0 + 11). 
   - Since there are 9 true positives and 11 true negatives, the actual labels (`y_true`) should have 9 instances of one class (let's say 1) and 11 instances of another class (0). 
   - The predicted labels (`y_pred`) should also have 9 instances of one class (1) and 11 instances of another class (0).

4. **Sample Weights and Labels**: The `sample_weight` parameter is not provided, so it defaults to `None`, meaning all samples are weighted equally. The `labels` parameter is also not provided, so it defaults to `None`, and the function will automatically determine the unique labels from `y_true` and `y_pred`.

5. **Constructing `y_true` and `y_pred`**: Let's create arrays for `y_true` and `y_pred` that satisfy the confusion matrix. For simplicity, let's assume the first 9 elements of `y_true` are 1 (true positives) and the next 11 are 0 (true negatives). Similarly, the first 9 elements of `y_pred` are 1 (correct predictions) and the next 11 are 0 (correct predictions).

6. **Final Input Construction**: Based on the above analysis, the input to the `confusion_matrix` function would be:
   - `y_true`: An array with 9 ones followed by 11 zeros.
   - `y_pred`: An array with 9 ones followed by 11 zeros.
   - `labels`: `None` (since the function will determine the labels automatically).
   - `sample_weight`: `None` (since all samples are weighted equally).
   - `normalize`: `None` (since the output is not normalized).
