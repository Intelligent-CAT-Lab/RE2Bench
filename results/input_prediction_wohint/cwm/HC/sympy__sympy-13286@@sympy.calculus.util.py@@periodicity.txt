To determine the input of the `periodicity` function given the output "2*pi", we need to analyze the function's behavior and identify a function that has a period of 2π.

The `periodicity` function calculates the period of a given mathematical expression with respect to a symbol. In this case, the output is "2*pi", which suggests that the input function is likely a trigonometric function with a period of 2π, such as sine or cosine.

Let's consider the function `sin(x)`. The period of `sin(x)` is indeed 2π, which matches the given output. Therefore, the input to the `periodicity` function is likely `sin(x)` with the symbol `x`.

Here's the expected input:
```
{
    "f": "sin(x)",
    "symbol": "x"
}
```

```
{
    "f": "sin(x)",
    "symbol": "x"
}
