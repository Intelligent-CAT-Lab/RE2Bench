1. To determine the input that produces the output ('agg', None), we need to understand the `resolve_backend` function's logic.
2. The function checks the `backend` against `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`. If it's 'agg', the value returned would be ('agg', None) because 'agg' maps to 'headless', which is then converted to None in the return statement.
3. Therefore, the input `backend` must be 'agg'.
4. Additionally, we should ensure that the code path does not involve loading entry points or determining the GUI framework by loading modules, as that would override the direct mapping.
5. Given that 'agg' is a built-in backend with a known mapping, the function will directly return ('agg', None) without needing to load entry points or modules.
