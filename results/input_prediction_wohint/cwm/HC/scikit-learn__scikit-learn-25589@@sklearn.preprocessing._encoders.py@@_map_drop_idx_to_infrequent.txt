I need to predict the input to the function `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` given the output is 0. 

The function signature of `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` is:
```python
def _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx):
```

First, I need to understand how `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` works. From the code, if `self._infrequent_enabled` is False, it simply returns `drop_idx`. However, if `self._infrequent_enabled` is True, then it checks if the `drop_idx` is part of infrequent indices and if so, maps it to another index.

Given that the output is 0, and considering that the function could return `drop_idx` directly if `self._infrequent_enabled` is False, or map it to another index if `self._infrequent_enabled` is True, I need to explore possible scenarios.

Let's consider the case where `self._infrequent_enabled` is False. In this case, the function simply returns `drop_idx`. So if the output is 0, then the input `drop_idx` must be 0.

Alternatively, if `self._infrequent_enabled` is True, and `drop_idx` is mapped to another index, but in this case, the output is 0. It could be that `drop_idx` is mapped to 0. However, without knowing the exact mapping, it's hard to say. But given the simplicity of the problem, it's more likely that the function is returning `drop_idx` directly, implying that `self._infrequent_enabled` is False.

So, the most straightforward prediction is that `feature_idx` can be any value (since it's not used in the return statement when `self._infrequent_enabled` is False), and `drop_idx` is 0.
