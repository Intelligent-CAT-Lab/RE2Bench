Let's break down the problem step by step.

The `__int__` method is called, and the output is `null`. We need to find the input that would lead to this output.

1. First, we look at the `__int__` method in the provided code. It checks if the object is a number and if it can be converted to an integer. If the object is not a number, it raises a `TypeError`. If the object is a number, it checks if it's a complex number and if it can be converted to an integer.

2. Since the output is `null`, it means that the input must have caused a `TypeError` to be raised. This is because the `__int__` method returns `null` when it encounters an error.

3. Looking at the code, we can see that the `__int__` method checks if the object is a number using the `is_number` property. If the object is not a number, it raises a `TypeError`.

4. We need to find an input that would cause the `is_number` property to return `False`. This would happen if the input is a symbolic expression that cannot be evaluated to a number.

5. Based on the provided code, we can see that the `is_number` property is defined in the `Expr` class. It checks if all the arguments of the expression are numbers.

6. Therefore, the input that would lead to the `__int__` method returning `null` is a symbolic expression that cannot be evaluated to a number.

Here is the input that would lead to the `__int__` method returning `null`:
[INPUT]
{
    "self": {
        "is_number": false
    }
}

    }
