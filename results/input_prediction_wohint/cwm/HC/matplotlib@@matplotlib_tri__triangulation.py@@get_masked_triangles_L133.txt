The output of `get_masked_triangles` is an array of triangles. The function checks if a mask is set and, if so, returns the triangles where the mask is False. If no mask is set, it returns all triangles.

Given the output, it appears that the mask is not set (or is all False), because the output includes all triangles. To confirm, we need to check the `mask` attribute of the `Triangulation` object.

Since the output includes all triangles, the mask must be None or an array of False values. Therefore, the input to `get_masked_triangles` should have a mask that is either None or an array of False values with the same length as the number of triangles.
