To determine the input of `_read` given the output `{"output": false}`, we need to analyze the `_read` method and understand under what conditions it would return `False`.

The `_read` method reads bytes from a file and processes them using a dispatch table (`_dtable`). It continues processing bytes until it encounters a specific byte value (`140`) or until the state reaches `_dvistate.post_post`. If the state is `_dvistate.post_post`, it closes the file and returns `False`.

Given that the output is `False`, it suggests that the method reached the `_dvistate.post_post` state and closed the file. Therefore, the input to `_read` must be such that the processing of bytes leads to this state.

However, without specific details about the file contents or the initial state, we can only infer that the method was called on an instance of the `Dvi` class where the file processing eventually led to the `_dvistate.post_post` state.

Since the question asks for the input of `_read` and not the entire `Dvi` instance, and given that `_read` does not take any arguments (it operates on the instance's state and file), the input can be considered as the instance itself being in a state where processing will lead to `_dvistate.post_post`.

But to adhere to the required format and provide a meaningful answer within the constraints, we'll focus on the fact that `_read` is a method of the `Dvi` class and its execution leads to the specified output. Thus, the input can be represented as the instance of `Dvi` that, when `_read` is called, results in the file being closed and `False` being returned.
