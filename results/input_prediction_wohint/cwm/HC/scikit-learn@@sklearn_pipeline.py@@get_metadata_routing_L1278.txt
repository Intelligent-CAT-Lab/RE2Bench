To determine the input of `get_metadata_routing`, we need to understand what the method does and how it's supposed to return the given output.

1. **Understanding `get_metadata_routing`:**
   - This method generates a metadata routing structure for the `Pipeline` object.
   - It initializes a `MetadataRouter` object.
   - Then, for each transformer in the pipeline (excluding the final estimator if `with_final=False`), it adds method mappings to the router based on the transformer's capabilities.
   - Finally, it adds the method mapping for the final estimator in the pipeline.

2. **Analyzing the Output:**
   - The output is a dictionary representing the metadata routing configuration.
   - It includes a mapping for the "fit" method and other methods like "predict", "fit_predict", etc., to their respective "callee" methods.
   - The "router" part of the output includes metadata for "fit" and "predict" methods, indicating that these methods consume metadata.

3. **Determining the Input:**
   - Given the output, we can infer that the pipeline has a final estimator (not a transformer) because the output includes mappings for "fit" and "predict" methods without any transformer-specific mappings.
   - The final estimator likely has "fit" and "predict" methods that consume metadata.

4. **Constructing the Input:**
   - The input should be a `Pipeline` object with a final estimator that has "fit" and "predict" methods.
   - The steps in the pipeline should be such that the final estimator is not a transformer but an estimator that can fit and predict.

Based on this analysis, the input to `get_metadata_routing` would be a `Pipeline` object with a structure that leads to the given output. However, without specific details about the estimators or transformers used, we can only speculate on the exact structure. The key point is that the pipeline's final estimator should have "fit" and "predict" methods that consume metadata.

Given the provided output and the function's behavior, here's a possible input structure:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "Pipeline": {
            "steps": [
                ["step1", "some_transformer"],
                ["step2", "some_estimator"]
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

This input assumes a pipeline with a transformer ("some_transformer") followed by an estimator ("some_estimator") that can fit and predict, aligning with the metadata routing output provided.
