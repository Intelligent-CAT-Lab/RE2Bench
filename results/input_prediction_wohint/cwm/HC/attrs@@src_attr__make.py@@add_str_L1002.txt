To solve this problem, we need to determine the input of the `add_str` method given the output of `__repr__`. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is `<_ClassBuilder(cls=Error)>`, which is the string representation of an instance of `_ClassBuilder`. This suggests that the `_ClassBuilder` instance was created with a class named `Error`.

2. **_ClassBuilder Initialization**: The `__init__` method of `_ClassBuilder` takes several parameters, but the most relevant one for our purpose is `cls`, which is the class being processed. Given the output, we can infer that `cls` is `Error`.

3. **Determining the Input of `add_str`**: The `add_str` method does not take any parameters other than `self`, which is a reference to the instance of `_ClassBuilder`. Therefore, the input to `add_str` is simply an instance of `_ClassBuilder` that was initialized with `cls=Error`.

Given this analysis, the input to `add_str` can be represented as an instance of `_ClassBuilder` where `cls` is `Error`.
