Let's analyze this step by step.

The output given is "Noto Sans CJK SC:style=normal:variant=normal:weight=normal:stretch=normal:size=12.0". This is a fontconfig pattern generated by the `get_fontconfig_pattern` method.

First, I need to figure out what the `FontProperties` object must have had in terms of attributes for this to happen. The fontconfig pattern is built by taking the family, style, variant, weight, stretch, file, and size from the FontProperties object.

Breaking down the output:

1. "Noto Sans CJK SC" is the family.
2. style=normal
3. variant=normal
4. weight=normal
5. stretch=normal
6. size=12.0

So, the FontProperties object must have these values set. 

Looking at the `__init__` method of FontProperties, it calls several set methods if the corresponding parameters are provided. However, in this case, since the output is a fontconfig pattern, it's likely that the family was passed as a string, and style, variant, weight, stretch, and size were not explicitly provided (or were set to their defaults).

Wait, but the `__init__` method has a special case: if family is a string and style, variant, weight, stretch, size, and fname are all None, then it calls `set_fontconfig_pattern(family)`. But in this case, the family is "Noto Sans CJK SC", and the other attributes are set to their defaults (normal for style, variant, weight, stretch, and 12.0 for size). 

So, the FontProperties object was likely initialized with family="Noto Sans CJK SC", and the other parameters (style, variant, weight, stretch, size) were not provided, allowing them to take their default values.

Therefore, the input to `get_fontconfig_pattern` would be a FontProperties instance with the following attributes:
- family: ["Noto Sans CJK SC"]
- style: "normal"
- variant: "normal"
- weight: "normal"
- stretch: "normal"
- size: 12.0
- file: None (since it's not mentioned in the output)
- math_fontfamily: whatever the default is, but it's not relevant here

Now, let's construct the input JSON for this FontProperties instance.
