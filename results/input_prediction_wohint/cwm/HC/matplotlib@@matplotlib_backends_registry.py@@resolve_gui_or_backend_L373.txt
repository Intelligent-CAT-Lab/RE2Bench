1. We have the output of `resolve_gui_or_backend` as `null`, meaning it returned `None` or an exception was raised. Since `resolve_gui_or_backend` calls `resolve_backend` which might raise an exception if the backend isn't recognized, let's consider that scenario.

2. The function `resolve_gui_or_backend` first checks if the input is not starting with "module://" and converts it to lowercase. Then, it tries to find a backend using `backend_for_gui_framework`. If that fails, it calls `resolve_backend`.

3. Given that the output is `null`, it suggests that `resolve_backend` raised an exception. This would happen if the input backend is not recognized.

4. To replicate this, we need an input that is not a recognized GUI framework or backend. Let's assume the input is "unknown_backend".

5. The function will call `backend_for_gui_framework("unknown_backend")`, which returns `None` because "unknown_backend" is not in `_GUI_FRAMEWORK_TO_BACKEND`.

6. Then, it calls `resolve_backend("unknown_backend")`. Since "unknown_backend" is not a built-in backend, it will check if entry points are loaded. If not, it loads them, but "unknown_backend" is still not recognized, leading to a `RuntimeError`.

7. However, the output is `null`, which could mean the exception was caught and `null` was returned, or the input was `None`. Let's consider the input being `None`.

8. If the input is `None`, `resolve_gui_or_backend` will call `get_backend()` from `matplotlib`, which returns the default backend. Assuming the default backend is recognized, it would return a valid backend and GUI framework, not `null`.

9. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the input is an unrecognized backend, leading to an exception being raised and `null` being returned.

10. Let's test with an unrecognized backend, e.g., "invalid_backend".
