To determine the input of the `radsimp` function given the output "1/(a - b)", let's analyze the function's behavior step by step.

1. **Function Overview**: The `radsimp` function is designed to simplify radical expressions. It handles the denominator by denesting radicals where possible and returns the simplified form.

2. **Input Output Relationship**: Given the output is "1/(a - b)", it suggests the input expression, when simplified, results in this form. Since the output is a simple fraction without any radicals in the denominator, the input likely does not contain any radicals that need denesting.

3. **Simplification Process**: The function first separates the input expression into a coefficient and the rest of the expression. It then normalizes the expression and applies a series of simplifications, including handling radicals in the denominator.

4. **Denominator Handling**: The critical part of the function for this problem is how it handles the denominator. If the denominator contains radicals, it attempts to denest them. However, in this case, the output suggests that the denominator does not contain any radicals after simplification, indicating the input might have been a simple fraction or an expression that simplifies to a fraction without radicals in the denominator.

5. **Input Deduction**: Given the output "1/(a - b)", a likely input could be an expression that directly simplifies to this, possibly involving symbolic variables a and b without any radical terms. The input could be a simple fraction or an expression that, when simplified by `radsimp`, results in "1/(a - b)".

Given the analysis, a plausible input to `radsimp` that results in the output "1/(a - b)" could be the expression itself, assuming no radical denesting is required.
