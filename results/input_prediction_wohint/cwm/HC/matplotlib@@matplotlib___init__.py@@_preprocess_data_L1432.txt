Let's analyze the problem step by step. The task is to predict the input of the `_preprocess_data` function given its output, which is another function.

1. **Understanding the `_preprocess_data` Function**: This function is a decorator that preprocesses data for matplotlib functions. It allows parameters to be replaced by values from a `data` dictionary. The function takes another function `func` and optional arguments `replace_names` and `label_namer`.

2. **Analyzing the Output**: The output provided is a function object (`<function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs at 0x71b989c0c720>`). This suggests that `_preprocess_data` was used as a decorator on this function.

3. **Inferring the Input**:
   - The `func` parameter must be the function that was decorated, which is `test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs`.
   - Since the output function is a result of applying `_preprocess_data` to `func_kwargs`, and there are no specific `replace_names` or `label_namer` mentioned in the output, it's likely that these parameters were not explicitly provided. Therefore, they would default to `None`.

4. **Conclusion**: The input to `_preprocess_data` would be the function `func_kwargs` without any additional parameters for `replace_names` and `label_namer`.

{
    "func": "<function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs at 0x71b989c0c720>",
    "replace_names": null,
    "label_namer": null
