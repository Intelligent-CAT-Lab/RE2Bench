We are given the `add` method of a `Dispatcher` class and an output that shows no exception was raised. Let's walk through what happens in the `add` method.

1. The `add` method is called with a signature, a function, and an optional `on_ambiguity` callback. 

2. The first step is to check if the signature is empty. If it is, the method tries to extract type annotations from the function using `get_func_annotations`. In our case, the output does not show any errors related to annotations, so this step must not have been triggered, meaning the signature was provided.

3. Next, the method checks if any of the types in the signature are tuples. If they are, it expands these tuples using `expand_tuples` and recursively calls `add` for each expanded tuple. Since there's no output indicating this expansion happened, we can assume the signature did not contain any tuples.

4. The method then iterates over each type in the signature to ensure they are all valid types (i.e., instances of `type`). If any type is not valid, it raises a `TypeError`. The output does not show any error message related to this check, so all types in the signature must be valid.

5. After validating the signature, the method adds the function to the dispatcher's `funcs` dictionary under the given signature.

6. The `reorder` method is called to update the ordering of the functions based on the new addition. This step might trigger an ambiguity check, but since there's no output indicating an ambiguity warning, we can assume no ambiguities were found.

7. Finally, the cache is cleared to ensure that any previously computed results are not used with the updated dispatcher.

Given that no exceptions were raised and the output is `null`, we can infer that the input to the `add` method must have been valid. The most straightforward input that would result in this output is adding a function with a valid signature that does not introduce any ambiguities.
