1. The function `_common_new` returns `(function, limits, orientation)`.
2. The output `(1, [(x,)], 1)` implies:
   - `function` is `1` (likely due to sympification of a numeric input).
   - `limits` is `[(x,)]`, indicating the integral is indefinite with symbol `x`.
   - `orientation` is `1`, typical for indefinite integrals.
3. Thus, the input likely involves creating an indefinite integral where the integrand evaluates to `1` and the variable is `x`.
4. The function `Integral` is probably called with `1` as the function and `x` as the symbol.
5. However, since `_common_new` processes the integral, the direct input to `Integral` would be `1` and `x`.
6. But considering the structure of `_common_new`, the input should be such that when processed, it results in an indefinite integral of `1` with respect to `x`.
7. Therefore, the input to `_common_new` would be `cls=Integral`, `function=1`, `*symbols=(x,)`, `discrete=False`, and `**assumptions={}`.
