Okay, I need to figure out the input to `update_from_data_xy` that results in `output: null`. Let's look at the function's code.

First, the function `update_from_data_xy` checks if `len(xy) == 0`. If that's true, it returns immediately without doing anything, which would result in `output: null`. So, the input `xy` must be an empty array or an empty list.

Let me verify this. If `xy` is empty, then `path = Path(xy)` creates a path with no vertices. Then `self.update_from_path(path, ...)` is called. But in `update_from_path`, it checks if `path.vertices.size == 0` and returns early, doing nothing. So indeed, the output would be null.

Therefore, the input `xy` should be an empty array. Let's think about the possible JSON representations. Since `xy` is passed to `Path(xy)`, and `Path` expects an array-like of coordinates, an empty list `[]` would work. But in JSON, it's usually represented as an empty array `[]`.

Wait, but the input is presented in a JSON format. The function `update_from_data_xy` is called with `xy` as an argument. So the input should have `"xy": []` in the JSON object.

Also, the other parameters `ignore`, `updatex`, and `updatey` have default values. Since the output is null, it's likely that these parameters are not changed from their defaults. So `ignore` is `None`, `updatex` is `True`, and `updatey` is `True`.

Putting this all together, the input JSON should have `"xy": []` and the other parameters at their default values.
