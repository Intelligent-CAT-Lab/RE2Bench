To predict the input for the function `split_super_sub` that results in the output `("Fvec", null, null)`, we need to understand the behavior of the function.

1. The function takes a string `text` and splits it into three parts: a base name, superscripts, and subscripts.
2. It looks for underscores (`_`) and carets (`^`) to separate the parts. Double underscores (`__`) and double carets (`^^`) have different meanings.
3. If the text is empty, it returns an empty string and two empty lists.
4. The function also uses a regular expression to match names that end with digits, separating the name from the digits.



Therefore, the input to the function `split_super_sub` is "Fvelpha^+_1".
