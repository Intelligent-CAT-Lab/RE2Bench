To determine the input of `axis_aligned_extrema`, let's first analyze the output. The output is `array([], dtype=float64)` for both dimensions and roots. This implies that there are no extrema in the range [0, 1] for the curve, which can happen if the degree of the curve is less than or equal to 1.

Looking at the `axis_aligned_extrema` method, it checks if the degree `n` is less than or equal to 1 and returns empty arrays in that case. Therefore, the input curve must have a degree of 1 or less.

A Bezier curve with degree 1 has two control points. Let's assume the control points are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, which defines a straight line. This line has no extrema within the range [0, 1], so the output would be empty arrays.

Now, let's construct the input for the `BezierSegment` class. The control points are `[(0, 0), (1, 1)]`. 

The `BezierSegment` class takes these control points in its constructor. Therefore, the input to `axis_aligned_extrema` would be an instance of `BezierSegment` with control points `[(0, 0), (1, 1)]`.
