Let's break down the input and output step by step to deduce the original input that would generate this output when passed through the `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens` function.

1. **Understanding the Output**:
   - The output is a tuple containing two elements:
     - The first element is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a polynomial in terms of monomials (tuple keys) with their corresponding coefficients.
     - The second element is a tuple of generators (variables) that are used in the polynomials.

2. **First Element of Output**:
   - `[{(1,): '1'}]`: This suggests that there is one polynomial, which is a constant polynomial "1" (since the monomial `(1,)` represents the constant term, and the coefficient is "1").
   - This implies that one of the input expressions is a constant, likely `1` or `S.One` (SymPy's representation of 1).

3. **Second Element of Output**:
   - `['cos(phi)']`: This indicates that the generator (variable) used in the polynomial is `cos(phi)`. This suggests that one of the input expressions involves `cos(phi)`.

4. **Input Expressions**:
   - Since the first polynomial is a constant, one of the input expressions must be a constant (e.g., `1`).
   - The second expression must involve `cos(phi)` in a way that it becomes a generator in the polynomial representation. This could be an expression like `cos(phi)` itself or part of a more complex expression.

5. **Deducing the Input**:
   - Given the output, a plausible input could be two expressions: one constant and one involving `cos(phi)`.
   - For example, if the input expressions are `[1, cos(phi)]`, the function would process them and generate the observed output.

6. **Considering the Function's Behavior**:
   - The function `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens` processes each expression, decomposes it into terms, and then into coefficients and elements (bases with exponents).
   - For the constant `1`, it would be treated as a coefficient with no bases, resulting in the monomial `(1,)` and coefficient `1`.
   - For `cos(phi)`, since it's not a number and not a coefficient (assuming the default `_is_coeff` which checks for numbers), it would be treated as a base with exponent `1`, making it a generator.

7. **Final Input Deduction**:
   - Based on the output, the most straightforward input would be two expressions: a constant and `cos(phi)`.

Therefore, the input to the function `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens` that would produce the given output is likely two expressions: `[1, cos(phi)]`.
