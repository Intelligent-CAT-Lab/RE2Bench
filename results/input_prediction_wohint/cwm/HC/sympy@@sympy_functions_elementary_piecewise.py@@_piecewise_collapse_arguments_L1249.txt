First, I need to understand what the function `_piecewise_collapse_arguments` does. It seems to process a list of expression-condition pairs, simplifying and combining them based on certain rules. 

Given the output, which is a list of two pairs: `(1, x < 0)` and `(3, True)`, I need to figure out what the input `_args` could have been to result in this output.

Let's consider each pair:

1. `(1, x < 0)`: This means the expression `1` is associated with the condition `x < 0`.
2. `(3, True)`: This means the expression `3` is associated with the condition `True`.

Since `True` is a condition that is always true, it likely comes from a condition that was simplified or combined. The `x < 0` condition might have been part of a larger condition that was broken down.

Possible scenarios for the input:
- The original input might have had conditions that were combined or simplified. For example, if there was an `And` condition that included `x < 0` and another condition that was always true, it might have been simplified to just `x < 0`.
- The `True` condition could have come from a condition that was negated or combined in a way that resulted in a tautology.

However, without more context about the original conditions and expressions, it's challenging to determine the exact input. But based on the output, we can infer that the input likely contained at least two expression-condition pairs, one of which had a condition that simplified to `x < 0` and another that simplified to `True`.

Given the nature of the function, which seems to handle piecewise functions and their conditions, the input might have looked something like this:

    "input": [
        {
            "expr": 1,
            "cond": "x < 0"
        },
        {
            "expr": 3,
            "cond": true
        }
    ]
}
