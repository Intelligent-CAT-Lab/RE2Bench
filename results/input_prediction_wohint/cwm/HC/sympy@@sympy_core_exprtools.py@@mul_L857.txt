1. We are given the output of the `mul` function, which returns a `Term` object with coefficient 1, and both numerator and denominator as empty `Factors` objects.
2. The `mul` function multiplies two `Term` objects, combining their coefficients, numerators, and denominators.
3. To get the output where the numerator and denominator are empty, both `Term` objects must have the same factors in their numerators and denominators. This cancels them out, leaving an empty `Factors` object.
4. Let's assume the first `Term` object has coefficient 2, numerator `{x: 1}`, and denominator `{y: 1}`. The second `Term` object must have coefficient 1/2, numerator `{y: 1}`, and denominator `{x: 1}` to cancel out the factors.
5. When we multiply these two `Term` objects, the coefficients multiply to 1 (2 * 1/2), the numerators multiply to `{x: 1, y: 1}` and the denominators multiply to `{x: 1, y: 1}`. The `normal` function then cancels out the common factors, resulting in empty numerators and denominators.
