To predict the input of `_compute_n_features_outs`, given the output `[2]`, we need to consider the logic inside this method. The output is generated by computing the length of each category list in `self.categories_`. If there is any drop or infrequent category handling, it adjusts the output accordingly.

1. The output is `[2]`, meaning there is one feature, and it has 2 categories.
2. Since there is no drop or infrequent category handling mentioned in the output, we assume `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` and `self._infrequent_indices` are not affecting the output.
3. Therefore, `self.categories_` must be a list containing one list with 2 elements, representing the 2 categories for the single feature.

Given this, the input to `_compute_n_features_outs` would involve setting up `self.categories_` to match this scenario. The exact input would depend on how `self.categories_` is populated, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. However, based on the output, we can infer the necessary state of `self.categories_`.
