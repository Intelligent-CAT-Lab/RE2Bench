To predict the input of the `sympify` function given the output "2500/pi", I'll need to work backwards from the output to the input.

First, I know that the `sympify` function is used to convert an expression into a SymPy expression. The output "2500/pi" suggests that the input was a string that could be parsed into a SymPy expression.

Let me consider the possible inputs that could lead to the output "2500/pi". One possibility is that the input was the string "2500/pi". This string can be parsed by SymPy into the expression 2500 divided by pi, which matches the output.

Another possibility is that the input was a Python expression that evaluates to the same result, such as "2500 / sympy.pi" or "2500 / Symbol('pi')". However, since the output is a string, it's more likely that the input was a string that was parsed by SymPy.

Based on this analysis, I believe the input to the `sympify` function was the string "2500/pi".
