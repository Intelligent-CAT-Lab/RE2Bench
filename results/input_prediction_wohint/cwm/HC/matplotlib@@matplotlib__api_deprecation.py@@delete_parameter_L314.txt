1. The function `delete_parameter` is a decorator factory that returns a decorator function `wrapper` to deprecate a specific parameter in a given function.
2. When called with `func=None`, it returns a decorator that will be applied to the actual function later.
3. The output shows that the result of `delete_parameter` is a function object (`<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2 at 0x71b974693560>`). This suggests that `delete_parameter` was called with `func=None`, returning the decorator.
4. To match this output, the input to `delete_parameter` must have `func=None`, indicating that it's being used as a decorator factory, not as a decorator being applied to a function.

Therefore, the input should be the parameters passed to `delete_parameter` when it's used to create a decorator, not when it's applied to a function.
