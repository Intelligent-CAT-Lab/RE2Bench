<think>
1. The output "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>" suggests that the `add_repr` method was called on a `_ClassBuilder` instance associated with a class named `Concrete`.
2. Since `add_repr` is a method of `_ClassBuilder`, the input should be the instance of `_ClassBuilder` that has `cls` set to `Concrete`.
3. The `ns` argument passed to `add_repr` likely determines the namespace prefix in the generated `__repr__` method. If `ns` is `None`, it defaults to using the class name without a prefix. However, since the output doesn't specify a custom namespace, I'll assume `ns` is `None`.
