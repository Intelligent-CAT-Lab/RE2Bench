To solve this, I need to figure out what the input `h` and `m` values could be for the `vpack` function such that the output is `null`. Since the output is `null`, I'll assume that the function returns `None` because there was no need to adjust the glue settings.

The function `vpack` calculates the dimensions of a vertical list (`Vlist`) based on its children. The key part is how it handles the glue settings when the total height `h` is adjusted based on the mode `m`. 

Let's break down the conditions under which the output could be `null`:

1. **No Glue Adjustment Needed**: If the calculated height `x` (which is the difference between the desired height `h` and the calculated height `x = h - x`) is zero, the function sets all glue-related attributes to zero and returns early. This would result in no further glue adjustment and possibly a `null` output if the function doesn't return anything explicitly in this case.

2. **Glue Adjustment But No Change**: If the glue adjustment is calculated but doesn't result in any change to the glue settings (e.g., the glue ratio is zero), the function might return `None`.

Given these possibilities, the simplest scenario is when `x == 0`, leading to an early return without any glue adjustment. This would happen if the initial height `h` is exactly equal to the sum of the heights of the children plus any additional spacing from glue elements.

Therefore, to achieve an output of `null`, the input `h` should be such that when added to the sum of the children's heights (and any glue widths), it results in `x == 0`. Additionally, the mode `m` should be `'additional'` to ensure that `h` is added to the sum of the children's heights.

Assuming the sum of the children's heights and glue widths is `10.0`, setting `h` to `10.0` would make `x == 0`, leading to an early return and potentially a `null` output.

So, the input `h` would be `10.0`, and `m` would be `'additional'`.
