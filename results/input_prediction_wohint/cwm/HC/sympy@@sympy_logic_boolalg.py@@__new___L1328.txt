Let's break down the problem step by step.

We need to find the input to the `__new__` method of the `Equivalent` class that results in the output `Equivalent(Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z))`.

1. **Understanding the Equivalent Class**: The `Equivalent` class is a subclass of `BooleanFunction`. It's designed to handle logical equivalences between expressions. The `__new__` method is responsible for creating a new instance of the class.

2. **Analyzing the Output**: The output is an instance of `Equivalent` with two arguments: `Q.even(X*Z)` and `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`. This suggests that the input to the `__new__` method should be these two expressions.

3. **Considering the evaluate Parameter**: The `__new__` method has an `evaluate` parameter that defaults to `global_parameters.evaluate`. However, since the output is an `Equivalent` instance, it's likely that `evaluate` is `True`, and the method is processing the input expressions.

4. **Input to the __new__ Method**: Based on the output, the input to the `__new__` method should be the two expressions `Q.even(X*Z)` and `Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)`.

Now, let's construct the input in the required JSON format.

        "Q.even(X*Z)",
        "Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)"
