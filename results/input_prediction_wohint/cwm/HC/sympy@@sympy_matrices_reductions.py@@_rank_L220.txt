1. We are given the output of `_rank` as 1. This means the function determines the matrix rank to be 1.

2. The function `_rank` checks if the matrix has zero rows or columns and returns 0. Since the output is 1, the matrix must have at least one row and one column.

3. Next, it checks if the matrix has one row or one column. If so, it checks if all elements are zero using `iszerofunc`. If any element is non-zero, it returns 1. This suggests the matrix could be a single row or column with at least one non-zero element.

4. For a 2x2 matrix, it calculates the determinant. If the determinant is non-zero, it returns 2. If the determinant is zero but there's at least one non-zero element, it returns 1. Since the output is 1, this case might not apply here, or the determinant is zero.

5. The function then permutes columns to simplify the matrix and performs row reduction to find the number of pivot columns, which is the rank. However, since the output is 1, the row reduction likely resulted in one pivot.

6. Considering the output is 1, the matrix likely has one linearly independent row or column. A possible input could be a matrix with one non-zero element in a single row or column.

Given these steps, a possible input matrix `M` could be a 1x1 matrix with a non-zero element, or a matrix with one non-zero element in a single row or column.
