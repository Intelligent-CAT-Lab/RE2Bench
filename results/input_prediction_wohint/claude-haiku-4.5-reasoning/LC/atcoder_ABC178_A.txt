[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. `x = int(input())` - This reads the input and converts it to an integer
2. `if x == 1:` - This checks if x equals 1
3. If the condition is true, `print(0)` executes
4. Otherwise, `print(1)` executes

Given that the output is `0`, the condition `if x == 1:` must have been True.

Therefore, `x` must equal `1`.

Since `x = int(input())`, the input must have been the string `"1"` so that `int("1")` evaluates to `1`.

Let me verify:
- input: "1"
- x = int("1") = 1
- x == 1? Yes, True
- print(0) executes
- output: 0 ✓
