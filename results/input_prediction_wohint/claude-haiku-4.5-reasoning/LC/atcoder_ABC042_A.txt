[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given output "YES".

For the output to be "YES", we need to examine the control flow:
1. The first condition `ABC.count(5) == 2` must be True (otherwise the else block executes and prints "NO")
2. The nested condition `sum(ABC) == 17` must also be True (otherwise it prints "NO")

So we need:
- ABC must contain exactly 2 occurrences of the number 5
- The sum of all elements in ABC must equal 17

If ABC has exactly 2 fives and sum is 17:
5 + 5 + (remaining elements) = 17
10 + (remaining elements) = 17
remaining elements must sum to 7

The simplest solution would be to have three elements total: two 5s and one 7.
This gives us ABC = (5, 5, 7) in some order.

Let me verify:
- input: "5 5 7"
- ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split())) = (5, 5, 7)
- ABC.count(5) = 2 ✓
- First condition is True
- sum(ABC) = 5 + 5 + 7 = 17 ✓
- Nested condition is True
- Prints "YES" ✓
