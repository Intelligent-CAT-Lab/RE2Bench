[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what inputs would produce a `null` (None) output.

The `check_in` method can return:
1. `False` if `room_type` is not in `self.booked_rooms.keys()`
2. `False` if `room_number > self.booked_rooms[room_type][name]`
3. `None` (implicitly, no explicit return) in all other cases

The three ways to get `None` output are:
- `room_type` exists in `booked_rooms`, but `name` is NOT in `booked_rooms[room_type]` (falls through the second if block)
- `room_type` exists and `name` exists, and `room_number == booked_rooms[room_type][name]` (pops entry, no return)
- `room_type` exists and `name` exists, and `room_number < booked_rooms[room_type][name]` (subtracts rooms, no return)

The simplest case is when the guest name isn't in the bookings for that room type. Let me trace:
1. `"double" not in {"double": {...}}` → False, continue
2. `"Jane" in {"John": 2}` → False, skip the entire if block
3. Function falls through without explicit return → returns None

This produces the `null` output.
