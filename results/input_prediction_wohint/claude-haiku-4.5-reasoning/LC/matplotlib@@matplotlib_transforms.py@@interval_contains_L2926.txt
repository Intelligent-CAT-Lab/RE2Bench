[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `interval_contains`:

```python
def interval_contains(interval, val):
    a, b = interval
    if a > b:
        a, b = (b, a)
    return a <= val <= b
```

The function:
1. Unpacks the interval into a and b
2. Swaps them if a > b (to ensure a is the minimum)
3. Returns whether val is within the range [a, b] inclusive

The output is `"np.True_"`, which is a numpy boolean True value. This means the condition `a <= val <= b` evaluated to True.

For this to be True, the value must be between the interval bounds (after potential swapping).

Let me construct a simple input:
- `interval = [0, 10]` (or [10, 0], which would get swapped)
- `val = 5` (a value within the range)

Execution:
1. a = 0, b = 10
2. Check: 0 > 10? No
3. Return: 0 <= 5 <= 10 = True ✓

This produces the expected output.
