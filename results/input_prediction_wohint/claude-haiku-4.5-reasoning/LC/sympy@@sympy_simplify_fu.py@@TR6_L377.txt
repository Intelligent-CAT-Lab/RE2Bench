Let me trace through the execution of `TR6` with the output `"cos(phi)"`.

The function `TR6` is defined as:
```python
def TR6(rv, max=4, pow=False):
    return _TR56(rv, cos, sin, lambda x: 1 - x, max=max, pow=pow)
```

So it delegates to `_TR56` with:
- `f` = `cos`
- `g` = `sin`  
- `h` = `lambda x: 1 - x`

The `_TR56` function applies a bottom-up transformation that looks for power expressions of the form `f**exp` (where `f` is `cos` in this case) and applies specific transformations based on the exponent value.

However, `_TR56` has early return conditions:
1. If the input is NOT a Power expression with base being `cos`, it returns unchanged
2. If the exponent is 1, it returns unchanged
3. If the exponent is greater than max, it returns unchanged
4. If the exponent is negative, it returns unchanged

The output is simply `cos(phi)`, which is NOT a power expression (or is `cos(phi)**1`).

For this to be returned unchanged:
- The input `rv` must be `cos(phi)` (a simple cosine expression, not a higher power)
- Since `cos(phi)` doesn't match the pattern `rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == cos` (with exponent > 1), or matches the `rv.exp == 1` condition, it's returned as-is

Therefore, the input to `TR6` must be the expression `cos(phi)` with the default parameters (or any parameters since they won't affect an expression that doesn't match the transformation pattern).
