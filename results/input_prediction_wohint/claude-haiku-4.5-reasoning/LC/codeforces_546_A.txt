[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to find what input produces an output of 0.

The code reads three integers k, n, w from input.
Then it calculates sum = k*1 + k*2 + ... + k*w = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w)
Finally, it checks:
- If sum <= n, print 0
- Else, print (sum - n)

Since the output is 0, the condition `sum <= n` must be True.

Let me work with a simple case:
- If k=1, n=1, w=1:
  - sum = 0 (initially)
  - Loop runs for i in range(1, 2), which only includes i=1
  - sum += 1 * 1 = 1
  - Check: is 1 <= 1? Yes
  - Print 0 ✓

This satisfies the output of 0.

Let me verify:
- Input: "1 1 1"
- Parse: k=1, n=1, w=1
- sum = 1*1 = 1
- 1 <= 1 is True
- Output: 0 ✓
