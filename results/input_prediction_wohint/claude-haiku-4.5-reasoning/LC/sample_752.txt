[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the inputs.

The function is: `return (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s`

The output is: `"zzzzzabc"`

Breaking down the output string:
- It consists of 5 'z' characters followed by "abc"
- Total length: 8 characters

From the structure `(amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s`:
- The part after the 'z's must be `s`
- The 'z's come from `(amount - len(s)) * 'z'`

So:
- `s = "abc"` (the non-'z' suffix)
- `len(s) = 3`
- Number of 'z's = 5

From `(amount - len(s)) * 'z' = 5 * 'z'`:
- `amount - 3 = 5`
- `amount = 8`

Verification:
- `(8 - 3) * 'z' + "abc"` = `5 * 'z' + "abc"` = `"zzzzz" + "abc"` = `"zzzzzabc"` ✓
