Let me trace through the function step by step to work backwards from the output.

The function `solve(N)`:
1. Takes N and converts it to string: `str(N)`
2. Converts each digit character to int and sums them: `sum((int(i) for i in str(N)))`
3. Converts that sum to binary: `bin(...)`
4. Removes the '0b' prefix: `[2:]`

If the output is `"1100"`, then:
- `bin(sum_of_digits)[2:] = "1100"`
- This means `bin(sum_of_digits) = "0b1100"`
- Therefore `sum_of_digits = 12` (since binary 1100 = 8+4 = 12 in decimal)

So I need to find an N where the sum of its digits equals 12.

Some possibilities:
- N = 39: digits are 3 and 9, sum = 3 + 9 = 12 ✓
- N = 48: digits are 4 and 8, sum = 4 + 8 = 12 ✓
- N = 57: digits are 5 and 7, sum = 5 + 7 = 12 ✓
- N = 66: digits are 6 and 6, sum = 6 + 6 = 12 ✓

Let me verify with N = 39:
- str(39) = "39"
- sum of digits = 3 + 9 = 12
- bin(12) = "0b1100"
- "0b1100"[2:] = "1100" ✓

Any of these would work. I'll use N = 39.
