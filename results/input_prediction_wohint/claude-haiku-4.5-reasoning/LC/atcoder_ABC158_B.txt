[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to find what input produces an output of 0.

The code does:
```
ans = N // (A + B) * A
rem = N % (A + B)
ans += min(rem, A)
print(ans)  # Result should be 0
```

For the final `ans` to be 0:
`N // (A + B) * A + min(N % (A + B), A) = 0`

Let me consider the case where N = 0:
- `ans = 0 // (A + B) * A = 0 * A = 0`
- `rem = 0 % (A + B) = 0`
- `ans += min(0, A) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Output: 0 ✓

This works! And it works for any positive values of A and B.

Let me verify with concrete numbers N = 0, A = 1, B = 1:
- `ans = 0 // 2 * 1 = 0 * 1 = 0`
- `rem = 0 % 2 = 0`
- `ans += min(0, 1) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Print: 0 ✓

This solution is correct. The simplest input satisfying the output is when N = 0 (the total quantity is 0), which naturally results in an answer of 0 regardless of the values of A and B, as long as they're positive.
