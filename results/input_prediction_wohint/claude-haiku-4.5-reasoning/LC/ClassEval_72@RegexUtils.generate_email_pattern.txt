[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `generate_email_pattern` method:

1. It's an instance method that only takes `self` as a parameter
2. The method doesn't take any additional positional arguments
3. The method doesn't take any keyword arguments
4. The method doesn't reference any instance variables (no `__init__` method is defined in the class, so there are no instance attributes)
5. The method simply returns a hardcoded regex pattern string

The output matches exactly what the function returns - the regex pattern string for validating email addresses.

Since:
- `self` is an instance of `RegexUtils` with no instance variables defined
- There are no additional arguments passed to the method
- There are no keyword arguments

The input structure would be:
- `self`: An empty object (no instance variables)
- `args`: Empty object (no additional positional arguments)
- `kwargs`: Empty object (no keyword arguments)
