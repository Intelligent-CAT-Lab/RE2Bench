[THOUGHT]
To determine the input that produces the output `true`, I need to trace through the function execution:

1. The function `template_changed` returns `True` only in one place - inside the for loop when the condition `template_dir in file_path.parents` is satisfied.

2. For execution to reach that return statement:
   - `file_path.suffix` must NOT equal `'.py'` (otherwise it returns early without any value)
   - At least one `template_dir` returned by `get_template_directories()` must be in `file_path.parents`

3. `get_template_directories()` returns a set of Path objects representing configured template directories (from Django settings, app templates, etc.). These are typically relative paths joined with the current working directory.

4. For `template_dir in file_path.parents` to be true, `file_path` must be located within a subdirectory of a template directory.

5. A realistic scenario:
   - Current working directory: `/project`
   - Configured template directory: `/project/templates`
   - File changed: `/project/templates/app/index.html`
   - `file_path.suffix = '.html'` ✓ (not `.py`)
   - `file_path.parents` includes `Path('/project/templates')` ✓
   - The loop finds the match, calls `reset_loaders()`, and returns `True` ✓
