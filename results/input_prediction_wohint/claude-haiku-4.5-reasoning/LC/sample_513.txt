[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find possible inputs.

The function returns an empty array `[]`. This means all elements must have been removed by the three while loops.

Let me trace through the logic:
1. First while loop: `while -1 in array: array.pop(-3)` - removes element at index -3 while -1 exists
2. Second while loop: `while 0 in array: array.pop()` - removes the last element while 0 exists
3. Third while loop: `while 1 in array: array.pop(0)` - removes the first element while 1 exists

For the output to be an empty array, the simplest case is if the input is already an empty array `[]`:
- First loop: -1 is not in [], so skip
- Second loop: 0 is not in [], so skip
- Third loop: 1 is not in [], so skip
- Return []

This works! 

Note: Other inputs would also produce `[]`, such as `[-1, 0, 1]` (which would remove -1 via pop(-3), then remove both 0 and 1 via pop() and pop(0)), or any combination of only values -1, 0, and 1. However, the simplest valid input is an empty array.
