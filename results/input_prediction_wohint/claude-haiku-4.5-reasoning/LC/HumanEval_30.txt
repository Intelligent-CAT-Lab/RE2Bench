[THOUGHT]
The function `get_positive(l: list)` returns a list comprehension that filters elements from the input list `l`, keeping only those elements where `e > 0` (greater than 0).

Given the output is `[4, 5, 6]`, I need to work backwards:
- The elements 4, 5, and 6 all satisfy the condition `e > 0` (they are all greater than 0)
- These elements appear in the output in the same order they appear in the input
- Any elements that are ≤ 0 would be filtered out

The simplest input that would produce exactly `[4, 5, 6]` is a list containing just those three positive numbers: `[4, 5, 6]`.

However, the input could also contain additional non-positive elements (0 or negative numbers) that would be filtered out, such as `[4, 0, 5, -1, 6]` or `[0, 4, 5, 6, -2]`, etc. But the most straightforward answer is `[4, 5, 6]`.
