[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function step by step:

```python
def f(nums):
    for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
        nums.reverse()
    return nums
```

The function reverses the list `len(nums) - 1` times.

Key insight: Reversing a list twice returns it to the original state. Therefore:
- Even number of reversals → original list is returned
- Odd number of reversals → reversed list is returned

From the output `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`, I can see it has 7 elements.

With 7 elements:
- `len(nums) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6` iterations
- 6 is even, so we should get back the original list

Let me verify this works with the output:
- Iteration 1: reverse → `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- Iteration 2: reverse → `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- Iteration 3: reverse → `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- Iteration 4: reverse → `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)
- Iteration 5: reverse → `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`
- Iteration 6: reverse → `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Since we reverse an even number of times (6), we end up with the original. Therefore, the input must be the same as the output.
