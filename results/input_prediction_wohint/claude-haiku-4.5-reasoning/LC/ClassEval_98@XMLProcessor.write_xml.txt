[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `write_xml` function:

1. The function attempts to create an ElementTree from `self.root` and write it to a file
2. If any exception occurs in the try block, it catches it and returns `False`
3. The output shows `False`, meaning an exception was raised

Possible causes for the exception:
- `self.root` is `None` (the default initialized value) - attempting to create an ElementTree from None or write None would fail
- The file path is invalid or lacks write permissions
- Some other XML operation error

The most straightforward scenario is that `self.root` was never properly initialized (remains `None`), which would cause the `tree.write(file_name)` operation to fail with an exception.

When the XMLProcessor is initialized, `self.root` is set to `None` by default. If `write_xml` is called without ever setting `self.root` to a valid XML element, the ElementTree creation or write operation would fail and trigger the exception handler.
