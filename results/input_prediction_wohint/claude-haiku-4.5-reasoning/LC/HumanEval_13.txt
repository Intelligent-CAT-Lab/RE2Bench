[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `greatest_common_divisor` function, it implements the Euclidean algorithm:
1. While b is not 0, it repeatedly replaces (a, b) with (b, a % b)
2. When b becomes 0, it returns a

Since the output is 5, I need to find values of a and b where gcd(a, b) = 5.

Let me trace through with a = 10, b = 5:
- Iteration 1: a, b = (5, 10 % 5) = (5, 0)
- b is now 0, so the while loop exits
- return a = 5 ✓

This works! Other valid inputs could be:
- a = 5, b = 0 (trivial case, no loop iterations)
- a = 15, b = 10 (would take 3 iterations)
- a = 25, b = 15 (would take multiple iterations)

However, a simple non-trivial example would be a = 10, b = 5.
