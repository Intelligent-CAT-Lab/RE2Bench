[THOUGHT]
The `subtract` method is a static method that:
1. Takes two complex numbers c1 and c2
2. Subtracts their real parts: c1.real - c2.real
3. Subtracts their imaginary parts: c1.imag - c2.imag  
4. Returns a new complex number with these results

The output is `(2-2j)`, meaning:
- real part: 2
- imaginary part: -2

So I need to find c1 and c2 such that:
- c1.real - c2.real = 2
- c1.imag - c2.imag = -2

Let me try c1 = 3-1j and c2 = 1+1j:
- c1.real = 3, c1.imag = -1
- c2.real = 1, c2.imag = 1
- real result: 3 - 1 = 2 ✓
- imaginary result: -1 - 1 = -2 ✓
- complex(2, -2) = (2-2j) ✓

This works!
