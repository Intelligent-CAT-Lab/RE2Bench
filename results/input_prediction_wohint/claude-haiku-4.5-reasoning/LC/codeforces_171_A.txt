[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step:

```python
a, b = input().split()
b = int(b[::-1])
print(int(a) + b)
```

Given output: 1165701527

Working backwards:
- The final output is `int(a) + b = 1165701527`
- `b` is obtained by reversing the string and converting to int: `b = int(b[::-1])`
- `a` and `b` are initially strings obtained by splitting the input

So I need: `int(a) + int(b[::-1]) = 1165701527`

Let me find valid values. The simplest solution would be to put the entire sum in `a` and have `b` contribute nothing:
- If `a = "1165701527"` and `b = "0"`:
  - `b[::-1] = "0"` 
  - `int(b[::-1]) = 0`
  - `int(a) + int(b[::-1]) = 1165701527 + 0 = 1165701527` ✓

Let me verify this is correct by checking another possibility to be thorough:
- If we wanted a non-trivial reversal, say `a = "1000000000"`:
  - We'd need `int(b[::-1]) = 165701527`
  - So `b[::-1] = "165701527"` (as a string)
  - Therefore `b = "725107561"` (reverse of "165701527")
  - Checking: "725107561" reversed:
    - Original positions: 7-2-5-1-0-7-5-6-1
    - Reversed: 1-6-5-7-0-1-5-2-7 = "165107527" ✗
    - This gives 1000000000 + 165107527 = 1165107527, which is NOT equal to 1165701527

So the simplest valid solution is `a = "1165701527"` and `b = "0"`, giving input: "1165701527  0"
