1. The `parse` function takes a `version: str` parameter and attempts to create a `Version` object from it.

2. The output shows `<Version('1.11.3')>`, which is the string representation (likely `__repr__`) of a successfully instantiated `Version` object.

3. This means:
   - The `Version` class constructor succeeded (no `InvalidVersion` exception was raised)
   - The version string was successfully parsed by the regex in `Version.__init__`
   - The parsed version has the format/components shown: "1.11.3"

4. For the version "1.11.3", the regex would match and parse it as:
   - epoch: 0 (no epoch prefix, so default)
   - release: (1, 11, 3)
   - pre: None (no pre-release suffix like "a", "b", "rc")
   - post: None (no post-release suffix)
   - dev: None (no dev suffix)
   - local: None (no local version label)

5. Therefore, the input version string must be "1.11.3" (or a string that normalizes to exactly this version).
