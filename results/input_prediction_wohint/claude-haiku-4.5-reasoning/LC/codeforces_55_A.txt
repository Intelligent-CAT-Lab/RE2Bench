[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what produces "NO":

```python
n = int(input())
while n % 2 == 0:
    n /= 2
if n == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

Since the output is "NO", we know that after the while loop completes, `n != 1`.

The while loop divides `n` by 2 repeatedly as long as `n` is even. This effectively removes all factors of 2 from the number.

For the output to be "NO", after removing all factors of 2, the result must not equal 1. This means the input number must have odd prime factors (i.e., it's not a power of 2).

Let me test with a few values:
- If input is 3: 3 % 2 = 1 (odd), so while loop doesn't execute. n = 3, and 3 ≠ 1, so prints "NO" ✓
- If input is 6: 6 % 2 = 0, so n = 6/2 = 3. Then 3 % 2 = 1, so loop exits. n = 3 ≠ 1, so prints "NO" ✓
- If input is 4: 4 % 2 = 0 → n = 2. Then 2 % 2 = 0 → n = 1. Then 1 % 2 = 1, loop exits. n = 1, so prints "YES" ✗

So the program checks if the input is a power of 2. The output "NO" means the input is NOT a power of 2.

A simple example would be 3 (or any odd number > 1, or any non-power-of-2 even number like 6).
