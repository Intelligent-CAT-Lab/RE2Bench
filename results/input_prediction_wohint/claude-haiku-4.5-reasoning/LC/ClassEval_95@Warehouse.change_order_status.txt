[THOUGHT]
The `change_order_status` method has two possible outcomes:
1. If `order_id in self.orders` is True: it updates the status and returns None implicitly
2. If `order_id in self.orders` is False: it returns False

Since the output is `null` (which is Python's `None`), the first condition must have been satisfied. The method must have found the order_id in the orders dictionary, updated its status, and then implicitly returned None.

To get this output:
- The warehouse instance's `orders` dictionary must contain the order_id key
- When the order is found, the status is updated and None is returned (null in JSON)

For example, if we have an order "123" with initial status "pending", and we call `change_order_status("123", "completed")`, it will:
1. Check if "123" in self.orders → True
2. Set self.orders["123"]['status'] = "completed"
3. Return None implicitly
