[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `deposit` method:

```python
def deposit(self, amount):
    if amount < 0:
        raise ValueError('Invalid amount')
    self.balance += amount
    return self.balance
```

The method:
1. Checks if amount is negative (it's not, since no error was raised)
2. Adds the amount to the current balance
3. Returns the new balance

The output is `300`, which is the value returned by `self.balance` after the deposit.

So: `initial_balance + amount = 300`

Without additional constraints, there are multiple valid combinations:
- balance=0, amount=300 → result=300
- balance=100, amount=200 → result=300  
- balance=200, amount=100 → result=300
- etc.

The most straightforward assumption is to use the default balance of 0 and deposit an amount of 300:
- Initial balance: 0 (default from `__init__`)
- Deposit amount: 300
- Calculation: 0 + 300 = 300 ✓
