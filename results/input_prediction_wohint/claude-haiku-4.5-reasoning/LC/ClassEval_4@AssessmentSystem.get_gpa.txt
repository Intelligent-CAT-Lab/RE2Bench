[THOUGHT]
The `get_gpa` method calculates the average of course grades:
1. It checks if the name exists in self.students AND if the student has courses
2. If true, it returns: sum(courses values) / length(courses)
3. If false, it returns None

Since the output is 75.0 (not None), the student must exist in the system and have courses.

For the result to be 75.0, we need:
sum(course_grades) / count(courses) = 75.0

The simplest case is one course with a grade of 75.0:
- sum([75.0]) = 75.0
- len([75.0]) = 1
- 75.0 / 1 = 75.0 ✓

So we need:
- A student name (any string)
- That student in the students dictionary
- That student has a 'courses' dictionary with grades that average to 75.0
