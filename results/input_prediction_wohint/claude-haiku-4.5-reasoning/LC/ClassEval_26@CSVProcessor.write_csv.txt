[THOUGHT]
The `write_csv` method:
1. Opens a file with the given `file_name`
2. Creates a CSV writer
3. Writes rows of data using `writer.writerows(data)`
4. Returns 1 on success, 0 on exception

The output is 1, indicating the function executed successfully without raising any exception.

This means:
- The `file_name` was a valid path that could be opened for writing
- The `data` parameter was an iterable of iterables (compatible with `writerows()`)
- No exception occurred during file operations

Since only the return value (1) is given, any valid inputs that don't cause exceptions would work. A reasonable example would be simple CSV data with a valid filename.
