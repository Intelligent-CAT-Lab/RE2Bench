[THOUGHT]
Let me work through this function backwards from the output.

The function `f(num)`:
1. Takes a list `num`
2. Executes `num.append(num[-1])` - this appends the last element of the current list to itself
3. Returns the modified list

From the output `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`, I can see:
- The list has 5 elements
- After the append operation, we have an extra element at the end
- The last two elements are both `1`

Since `num.append(num[-1])` appends the last element that exists before the append:
- Before the append, the list had 4 elements
- The last element before append was `1` (which is why `1` got appended)
- So the input list must have been `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`

Verification:
- Input: `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`
- `num[-1]` = `1`
- After `num.append(1)`: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` ✓
- This matches the output
