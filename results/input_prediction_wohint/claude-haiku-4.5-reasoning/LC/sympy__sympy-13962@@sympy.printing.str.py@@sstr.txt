[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine what input was needed.

The output is: `"Permutation([1, 0], size=6)"`

This output string comes from the `sstr(expr, **settings)` function, which:
1. Creates a `StrPrinter` with settings
2. Calls `doprint(expr)` which calls `_print(expr)`
3. The `_print` method dispatches to `_print_Permutation` since expr is a Permutation

Looking at the `_print_Permutation` code:
```python
else:  # print_cyclic is False
    s = expr.support()
    if not s:
        ...
    trim = str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) + ', size=%s' % expr.size
    use = full = str(expr.array_form)
    if len(trim) < len(full):
        use = trim
    return 'Permutation(%s)' % use
```

The output `"Permutation([1, 0], size=6)"` indicates:
- `use == trim` (since the output includes size)
- This means `len(trim) < len(full)` 
- So `str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) == "[1, 0]"`
- And `expr.size == 6`

For `array_form[:s[-1] + 1]` to equal `[1, 0]`, we need `s[-1] = 1` (slice to position 2).

The `support()` returns indices where the permutation isn't the identity:
- If `array_form = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
  - Index 0: value is 1 (not 0) → in support
  - Index 1: value is 0 (not 1) → in support  
  - Index 2-5: values equal indices → not in support
- So `support() = [0, 1]` with `s[-1] = 1` ✓

This gives us:
- `_array_form = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `_size = 6`

The `sstr` function takes `expr` as the main argument and optional `settings` as kwargs. Since no settings are specified in the output analysis, `kwargs` should be empty.

Following the format from the example (showing object attributes), the Permutation object should be represented by its internal state attributes.
