[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code backwards from the output:

1. The output is `1`, which comes from `print(ans)`, so `ans = 1`

2. `ans = T // A * B`, which means `T // A * B = 1`
   - Here `//` is integer division, so we need: (T divided by A, then floored) multiplied by B equals 1

3. `A, B, T = map(int, input().split())` - the input consists of three space-separated integers

For `T // A * B = 1`, let me consider what values work:
- Since both `T // A` and `B` are integers, and their product is 1, there are limited possibilities
- The only way to get 1 from multiplying two integers is if both are 1: `1 * 1 = 1`
- So we need: `T // A = 1` and `B = 1`
- `T // A = 1` means `A ≤ T < 2*A`

The simplest solution that satisfies this:
- A = 1, B = 1, T = 1
- Verification: `1 // 1 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1` ✓

So the input should be three space-separated integers: "1 1 1"
