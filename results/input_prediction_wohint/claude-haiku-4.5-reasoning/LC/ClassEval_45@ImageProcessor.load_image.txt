[THOUGHT]
The `load_image` method:
1. Takes `image_path` as a parameter
2. Calls `Image.open(image_path)` to load an image from the file path
3. Assigns the opened image to `self.image`
4. Returns nothing (implicitly returns `None`)

Since the output is `null` (which is Python's `None`), this is the expected return value for a method that doesn't explicitly return anything. The `null` output is consistent with successful execution of this function.

The function would succeed and return `None` for any valid image file path that exists and can be opened by PIL. Without additional context, any valid image path would work. A typical example would be a common image filename.

The `self` object before calling this method would have `image = None` (from `__init__`).
