[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The code does: `print(input().replace(',', ' '))`

This means:
1. It reads an input string
2. It replaces all commas ',' with spaces ' '
3. It prints the result

Given the output: `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`

I need to find what input, after replacing commas with spaces, produces this output.

The output has three words separated by spaces: "avrnc", "fwujpcm", "ggjmc"

Working backwards:
- The three words in the output are: "avrnc", "fwujpcm", "ggjmc"
- The spaces between them in the output could have come from either spaces or commas in the original input
- The simplest and most logical inference is that where we see spaces in the output, there were commas in the input (since the code specifically replaces commas with spaces)

So the input should have been: `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"`

Verification:
- Input: "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
- After .replace(',', ' '): "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" ✓
- This matches the output!
