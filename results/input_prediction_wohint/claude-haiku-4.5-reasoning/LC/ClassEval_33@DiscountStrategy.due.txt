Looking at the `due()` method:
```python
def due(self):
    if self.promotion is None:
        discount = 0
    else:
        discount = self.promotion(self)
    return self.__total - discount
```

The output is 139.5, which means: `self.__total - discount = 139.5`

The simplest case is when `promotion is None`:
- `discount = 0`
- `return self.__total - 0 = self.__total = 139.5`

This requires `self.__total = 139.5`. This value is set in `__init__` by calling `self.total()` (though the `total()` method is not shown in the provided code).

For `due()` to return 139.5 with no promotion:
- `self.promotion = None` (no discount applied)
- `self._DiscountStrategy__total = 139.5` (the private attribute after initialization)
- `customer` and `cart` values don't affect the output of `due()`

Executing: `139.5 - 0 = 139.5` ✓
