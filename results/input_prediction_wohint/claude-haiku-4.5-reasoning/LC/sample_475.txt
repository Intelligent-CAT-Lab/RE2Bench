The function `f` takes an array and an index, and returns the element at that index. It also handles negative indices by converting them to positive indices.

Given that the output is `1`, this means `array[index]` must equal `1`.

Let me trace through the function:
1. If `index >= 0`, the condition `if index < 0` is false, so index stays the same
2. The function returns `array[index]`

So we need `array[index] = 1`.

The simplest input would be:
- `array = [1]` and `index = 0`
  - Check: `0 < 0`? No, so index stays 0
  - Return: `array[0] = 1` ✓

Alternatively, it could be:
- `array = [1]` and `index = -1` (negative indexing)
  - Check: `-1 < 0`? Yes, so `index = 1 + (-1) = 0`
  - Return: `array[0] = 1` ✓

Or any array with 1 at a particular position accessed by the appropriate index.

I'll go with the most straightforward case: a single-element array containing 1, accessed at index 0.
