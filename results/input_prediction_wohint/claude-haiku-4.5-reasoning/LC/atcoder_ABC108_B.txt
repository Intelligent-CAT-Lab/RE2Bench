Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The code reads: x1, y1, x2, y2
Then calculates:
- a = x2 - x1
- b = y2 - y1

And prints: x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a

The output is: "101 99 101 100"

So I have the system of equations:
1. x2 - b = 101
2. y2 + a = 99
3. x1 - b = 101
4. y1 + a = 100

Substituting a and b:
1. x2 - (y2 - y1) = 101  →  x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
2. y2 + (x2 - x1) = 99   →  y2 + x2 - x1 = 99
3. x1 - (y2 - y1) = 101  →  x1 - y2 + y1 = 101
4. y1 + (x2 - x1) = 100  →  y1 + x2 - x1 = 100

From equations 1 and 3:
- x2 - y2 + y1 = 101
- x1 - y2 + y1 = 101

Subtracting: x2 - x1 = 0, so x2 = x1 and therefore a = 0

From equation 4 with a = 0:
y1 + 0 = 100  →  y1 = 100

From equation 2 with a = 0:
y2 + 0 = 99  →  y2 = 99

From equation 3 with b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1:
x1 - (-1) = 101  →  x1 = 100

Since x2 = x1: x2 = 100

Verification:
- a = 100 - 100 = 0
- b = 99 - 100 = -1
- x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99 ✓
- x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101 ✓
- y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100 ✓
