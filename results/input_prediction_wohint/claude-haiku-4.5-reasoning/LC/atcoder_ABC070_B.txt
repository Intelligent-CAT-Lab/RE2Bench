Let me work through this code step by step.

The code reads 4 integers: `a, b, c, d`

Then it prints: `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))`

Given that the output is `0`, I need:
`max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)) = 0`

For `max(0, x) = 0`, the inner expression must be `≤ 0`:
`min(b, d) - max(a, c) ≤ 0`

This means:
`min(b, d) ≤ max(a, c)`

This is typically the case when two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] don't overlap or just touch at a boundary point.

Let me consider a simple case where the intervals don't overlap:
- If a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (two separate intervals [0,1] and [2,3])
- max(a, c) = max(0, 2) = 2
- min(b, d) = min(1, 3) = 1
- min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 1 - 2 = -1
- max(0, -1) = 0 ✓

This satisfies the output!
