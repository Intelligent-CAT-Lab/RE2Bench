[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to find the input.

The function performs min-max normalization using the formula: `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`

Given output: `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`

Key observations:
1. The output has 5 elements, so the input list must have 5 elements
2. The minimum output value is 0.0, which occurs when x = min_number
3. The maximum output value is 1.0, which occurs when x = max_number
4. The output values are: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0

These output values are evenly spaced from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.25 (or 1/4).

For a normalized output to have these evenly spaced values, the input must also be evenly spaced. If the input values are equally spaced, say [a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d], then:
- min_number = a
- max_number = a+4d
- The denominator (max_number - min_number) = 4d

For each element:
- (a - a) / (4d) = 0.0 ✓
- (a+d - a) / (4d) = d/(4d) = 0.25 ✓
- (a+2d - a) / (4d) = 2d/(4d) = 0.5 ✓
- (a+3d - a) / (4d) = 3d/(4d) = 0.75 ✓
- (a+4d - a) / (4d) = 4d/(4d) = 1.0 ✓

The simplest example would be a=0 and d=1, giving: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

Let me verify: min=0, max=4, then:
- (0-0)/(4-0) = 0.0 ✓
- (1-0)/(4-0) = 0.25 ✓
- (2-0)/(4-0) = 0.5 ✓
- (3-0)/(4-0) = 0.75 ✓
- (4-0)/(4-0) = 1.0 ✓

Perfect!
