[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution:

1. The function `make_random_password` has the signature:
   ```python
   def make_random_password(self, length=10, allowed_chars='abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'):
   ```

2. Looking at the output: `"PNFHWJjwvd"`
   - Length: 10 characters
   - Characters used: P, N, F, H, W, J (uppercase), j, w, v, d (lowercase)
   - All these characters exist in the default `allowed_chars`
   - No special characters or digits (2-9) are present

3. The function:
   - Issues a deprecation warning (doesn't affect the return value)
   - Returns `get_random_string(length, allowed_chars)`

4. Given that:
   - The output is exactly 10 characters (matches the default `length=10` parameter)
   - All characters are from the default `allowed_chars` set
   - No additional parameters appear to have been overridden

5. The most parsimonious conclusion is that the function was called with **default parameters** - i.e., no arguments passed beyond `self`.

6. Based on the example format:
   - `args`: contains positional parameters that were passed
   - `kwargs`: contains keyword parameters that were passed
   - `self`: represents the instance (can be empty if no relevant state affects output)

Since no parameters were passed and all defaults were used:
- `args` would be `{}`
- `kwargs` would be `{}`
- `self` would be an empty instance of BaseUserManager
