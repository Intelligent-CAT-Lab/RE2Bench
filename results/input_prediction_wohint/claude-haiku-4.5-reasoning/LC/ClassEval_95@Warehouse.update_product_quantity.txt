[THOUGHT]
The function `update_product_quantity` has no explicit return statement, so it always returns `None` (which appears as `null` in JSON output).

The function logic:
1. Checks if `product_id` exists in `self.inventory`
2. If yes, adds the `quantity` value to the existing quantity
3. If no, does nothing
4. Returns None (implicitly)

Since the output is `null` (None), this is the guaranteed return value regardless of the input parameters. However, a realistic scenario would be:
- The warehouse has at least one product in inventory with a 'quantity' field
- We call the method with a product_id that exists
- The quantity gets updated by adding the provided value
- The method returns None

For example, if we have:
- `self.inventory = {"ITEM001": {"quantity": 50}}`
- `product_id = "ITEM001"` (exists in inventory)
- `quantity = 20` (amount to add)

Then: the if condition is True, quantity updates from 50 to 70, and function returns None.
