[THOUGHT]
The `extract_all` method returns `False` when an exception occurs during the extraction process.

Possible reasons for an exception:
1. The zip file doesn't exist
2. The file is not a valid zip file
3. The output path is invalid or inaccessible
4. Permission denied when reading/writing

Since the output is `false`, we know an exception was caught in the try-except block. The most common scenarios would be:
- `self.file_name` points to a non-existent file → `FileNotFoundError`
- `self.file_name` points to an invalid/corrupted zip file → `BadZipFile` exception
- `output_path` is invalid or lacks permissions → `OSError`/`PermissionError`

Any of these would cause the function to return `False`. A straightforward scenario would be attempting to extract from a file that doesn't exist or is not a valid zip file.
