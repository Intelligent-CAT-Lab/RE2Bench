The function `dup_l1_norm` computes the L1 norm of a polynomial, which is the sum of absolute values of its coefficients.

Given output: 3

Let me trace the execution:

1. The function first checks if `f` is empty (falsy). If it is, it returns `K.zero` (which would be 0 for an integer domain). Since the output is 3 (not 0), `f` must be non-empty.

2. If `f` is non-empty, the function executes:
   ```python
   return K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))
   ```

3. `dup_abs(f, K)` returns a list with absolute values of each coefficient: `[K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]`

4. `K.sum(...)` sums these absolute values: `sum(absolute_values, start=K.zero)`

For the output to be 3, we need the sum of absolute coefficient values to equal 3.

Possible inputs:
- f = [3]: |3| = 3 ✓
- f = [1, 2]: |1| + |2| = 1 + 2 = 3 ✓  
- f = [-1, 2]: |-1| + |2| = 1 + 2 = 3 ✓
- f = [1, 1, 1]: |1| + |1| + |1| = 3 ✓

I'll use f = [1, 2] as it demonstrates the function handling multiple coefficients.

For K, since the output is the integer 3, the domain should be ZZ (integers).

Verification:
1. f = [1, 2] is truthy, proceed to else branch
2. dup_abs([1, 2], ZZ) → [1, 2]
3. ZZ.sum([1, 2]) → sum([1, 2], start=0) → 0 + 1 + 2 → 3
4. Return 3 ✓
