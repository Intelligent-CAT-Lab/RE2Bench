[THOUGHT]
The function `construct_stop_word_list` is an instance method of the `NLPDataProcessor` class.

Analyzing the code:
1. The method takes only `self` as a parameter (no additional arguments)
2. It creates a list `['a', 'an', 'the']`
3. It returns that list directly

The output `["a", "an", "the"]` matches exactly what the function creates and returns.

Since this method has no parameters beyond `self` and no conditional logic that affects the output, the function will always return the same list regardless of the state of `self`. Therefore:
- `self` is just an instance of `NLPDataProcessor` (its state doesn't affect output)
- No positional arguments (`args`) are passed
- No keyword arguments (`kwargs`) are passed
