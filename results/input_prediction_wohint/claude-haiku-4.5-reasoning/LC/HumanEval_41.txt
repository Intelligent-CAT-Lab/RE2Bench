[THOUGHT]
Looking at the function:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n ** 2
```

The function takes an integer `n` and returns `n` squared.

Given the output is `9`, I need to find the value of `n` such that `n ** 2 = 9`.

Solving: `n ** 2 = 9` means `n = 3` or `n = -3`

Since both are mathematically valid, but the function name suggests a "car race collision" context where a positive integer makes more sense, `n = 3` is the most reasonable answer.

Verification: `3 ** 2 = 9` ✓
