[THOUGHT]
The `add_event` function takes an `event` parameter and appends it to the `self.events` list. The function doesn't explicitly return anything, so it returns `None` (which is `null` in JSON).

Since the output is `null` regardless of what event is passed, the output itself doesn't constrain what the input could be. However, based on the class structure (a CalendarUtil designed to manage events), a reasonable event would be some kind of data structure representing a calendar event.

The input should include:
1. `self` with its initial state: `events` list (empty before adding)
2. `args` with the `event` parameter - a reasonable calendar event
3. `kwargs` as empty since no keyword arguments are used

A reasonable event for a calendar application could be a dictionary with event details, or even a simple string. I'll provide a typical event structure.
