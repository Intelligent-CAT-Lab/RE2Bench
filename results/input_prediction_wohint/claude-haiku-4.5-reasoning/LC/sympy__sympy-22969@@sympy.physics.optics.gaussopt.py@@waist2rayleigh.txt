[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the inputs.

The function is:
```python
def waist2rayleigh(w, wavelen, n=1):
    w, wavelen = map(sympify, (w, wavelen))
    return w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen
```

The output is: `"pi*w_0**2/l"`

Working backwards:
1. The function returns: `w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen`
2. This equals: `w_0 ** 2 * n * pi / l`

So:
- After `sympify(w)`, we need to get the symbol `w_0`, which means the input `w` should be `"w_0"`
- After `sympify(wavelen)`, we need to get the symbol `l`, which means the input `wavelen` should be `"l"`
- With `n = 1` (the default value):
  - `w_0 ** 2 * 1 * pi / l = pi * w_0 ** 2 / l`

This matches the expected output format when SymPy expressions are stringified.

Since `n` is not being changed from its default value of 1, we can omit it from the kwargs.
