[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code backwards from the output:

1. The output is "Yes", which comes from `print(result)`
2. So `result = 'Yes'`
3. From `result = 'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'`:
   - For result to equal 'Yes', the condition `'A' in s and 'B' in s` must evaluate to True
   - This means both the condition `'A' in s` AND `'B' in s` must both be True
   - Therefore, the string `s` must contain both the character 'A' and the character 'B'
4. Since `s = stdin`, and `stdin = input()`, the input string must contain both 'A' and 'B'

The simplest input that satisfies this requirement would be any string containing both characters 'A' and 'B', such as "AB".

Let me verify with "AB":
- stdin = "AB"
- s = "AB"
- 'A' in "AB" → True
- 'B' in "AB" → True
- True and True → True
- result = 'Yes'
- print("Yes") ✓
