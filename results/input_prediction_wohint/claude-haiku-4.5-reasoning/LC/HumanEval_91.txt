[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `is_bored` function to understand what input would produce an output of 0.

The function:
1. Splits the input string `S` using the regex pattern `[.?!]\\s*` (which matches `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by optional whitespace)
2. For each sentence, checks if the first 2 characters equal `'I '` (capital I followed by a space)
3. Returns the sum of True values, which counts how many sentences start with `'I '`

For the output to be 0, the sum must be 0. This means no sentence should start with `'I '` (capital I followed by space).

Let me verify with a simple example like `S = "Hello"`:
- `re.split('[.?!]\\s*', "Hello")` returns `['Hello']` (no delimiters found)
- `sentences = ['Hello']`
- Generator expression checks: `'Hello'[0:2] == 'I '`
  - `'He' == 'I '` → False (first two characters are 'H' and 'e', not 'I' and space)
- `sum([False])` → 0 ✓

Other inputs that would also work:
- Empty string: `""` → `['']` → `''[0:2]` ≠ `'I '` → 0
- Any sentence not starting with "I ": `"How are you?"` → no "I " sentences → 0
- `"What? Why!"` → sentences start with 'W' not 'I ' → 0

The simplest non-edge-case would be a basic greeting like `"Hello"`.
