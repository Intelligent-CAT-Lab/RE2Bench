[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code execution step by step.

The code reads an integer `n`, then initializes:
- `i = 1`
- `j = n * n`

The loop `while i < j:` prints the pair `(i, j)`, increments `i` by 1, and decrements `j` by 1, until `i >= j`.

From the output, I can observe:
- The first line printed is "1 64", so i starts at 1 and j starts at 64
- The last line printed is "32 33", so the loop exits when i becomes 33 and j becomes 32

If j = 64 initially, and j = n * n, then:
- n * n = 64
- n = 8

Let me verify:
- n = 8, so n*n = 64
- Initialize: i = 1, j = 64
- First iteration: i < j? (1 < 64) ✓, print "1 64", then i = 2, j = 63
- Continue until: i < j? (32 < 33) ✓, print "32 33", then i = 33, j = 32
- Next check: i < j? (33 < 32) ✗, exit loop

This produces exactly 32 lines of output (from i=1 to i=32), which matches the given output.
