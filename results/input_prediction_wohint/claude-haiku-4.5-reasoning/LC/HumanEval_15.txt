[THOUGHT]
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` and:
1. Creates a range from 0 to n (inclusive, since it uses `range(n + 1)`)
2. Converts each number in that range to a string
3. Joins them together with space separators

Looking at the output: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`

I can count the numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - that's 11 numbers total.

For `range(n + 1)` to generate 11 numbers (0 through 10 inclusive), we need:
- `n + 1 = 11`
- Therefore `n = 10`

Verification: If `n = 10`:
- `range(11)` produces [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Converting to strings and joining with spaces gives: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"` ✓
