[THOUGHT]
The function `count_distinct_characters` works by:
1. Converting the input string to lowercase with `string.lower()`
2. Creating a set from the lowercase string, which removes all duplicate characters
3. Returning the length of that set

The output is `5`, which means `len(set(string.lower())) = 5`.

This tells us that after converting to lowercase, the string must contain exactly 5 distinct characters.

Working backwards:
- We need a string that, when converted to lowercase and converted to a set, has length 5
- The simplest such string would be one containing 5 distinct letters, like "abcde"
- It could also be "ABCDE" (uppercase), since `.lower()` would convert it to "abcde"
- It could also have duplicate characters, like "aabbccddee" or "helloworld" with repeated characters
- It could include special characters or numbers like "a1b2c3d4e" or similar

The most straightforward and minimal input would be a string with exactly 5 distinct characters with no duplicates.
