[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function backwards from the output "4".

The function converts a number `x` to a given `base` representation:
1. Initialize `ret = ''`
2. While `x > 0`, repeatedly:
   - Append the remainder `x % base` to the front of `ret`
   - Divide `x` by `base` (integer division)
3. Return `ret`

The output is `"4"` - a single digit string.

For this to happen with a single character result, I need exactly one iteration of the while loop that produces "4":
- In iteration 1: `ret = str(x % base) + "" = "4"`, so `x % base = 4`
- After iteration 1: `x = x // base` must equal `0` to exit the loop

For `x // base = 0`, we need `x < base`.

Combined with `x % base = 4`, this means: `x = 4` and `base > 4`

Let me verify with `x = 4, base = 10`:
- Iteration 1: `x = 4 > 0` (true)
  - `ret = str(4 % 10) + "" = "4"`
  - `x = 4 // 10 = 0`
- Loop condition: `0 > 0` (false) → exit
- Returns `"4"` ✓

Any base greater than 4 would work (5, 6, 7, ...), but base 10 (decimal) is the most standard choice.
