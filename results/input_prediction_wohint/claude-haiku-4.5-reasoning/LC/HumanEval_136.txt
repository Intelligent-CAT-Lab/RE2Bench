[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function with the given output.

The function returns: `(max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None)`

The output is: `[-1, null]` which represents the tuple `(-1, None)`

Breaking this down:
1. First element = `-1`:
   - This comes from `max(smallest) if smallest else None`
   - Since we got `-1` (not `None`), `smallest` must be non-empty
   - `smallest` contains all negative numbers from `lst` (elements where `x < 0`)
   - `max(smallest) = -1` means the largest (least negative) value among the negatives is `-1`

2. Second element = `None`:
   - This comes from `min(largest) if largest else None`
   - Since we got `None`, `largest` must be empty
   - `largest` contains all positive numbers from `lst` (elements where `x > 0`)
   - Empty `largest` means there are NO positive numbers in `lst`

Therefore, `lst` must contain:
- At least one negative number, with `-1` being the maximum (least negative) one
- No positive numbers (so only negative numbers and possibly 0)

The simplest input that produces this output is: `[-1]`

Let me verify:
- `smallest = filter(x < 0, [-1]) = [-1]`
- `largest = filter(x > 0, [-1]) = []`
- Return: `(max([-1]), None) = (-1, None)` ✓
