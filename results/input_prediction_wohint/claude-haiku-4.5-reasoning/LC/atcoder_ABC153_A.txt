[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code:

1. The code reads two integers `h` and `a` from input
2. It calculates `math.ceil(h / a)` and prints the result
3. The output is 6

So I need to find h and a such that: `math.ceil(h / a) = 6`

The ceiling function returns 6 when the result of h/a is in the range (5, 6], meaning:
- If h/a = 6.0 exactly, ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓
- If h/a = 5.1, ceil(5.1) = 6 ✓
- If h/a = 5.9, ceil(5.9) = 6 ✓
- If h/a = 5.0, ceil(5.0) = 5 ✗

The simplest solution is when h/a = 6 exactly, which occurs when h = 6 and a = 1.

Let me verify:
- Input: "6 1"
- h = 6, a = 1
- h / a = 6 / 1 = 6.0
- math.ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓

This matches the expected output.
