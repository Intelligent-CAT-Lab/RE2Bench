[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code backwards from the output.

The code does:
```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())
ans = A - 2 * B
if ans < 0:
    ans = 0
print(ans)
```

Given that the output is `0`, I need to find values of A and B such that the final printed value is 0.

Working backwards:
1. `print(ans)` outputs `0`, so `ans = 0` when printed.

2. Before printing, we have a conditional:
   ```python
   if ans < 0:
       ans = 0
   ```
   
   For the output to be 0, either:
   - `ans = A - 2*B` was already 0 (making `ans < 0` false), or
   - `ans = A - 2*B` was negative (making `ans < 0` true, so it gets set to 0)

3. Both cases are valid. For simplicity, let me choose the case where `A - 2*B ≤ 0`.

The simplest solution would be when A = 0 and B = 0:
- `ans = 0 - 2*0 = 0`
- `if 0 < 0:` is False, so ans remains 0
- `print(0)` outputs 0 ✓

This matches the expected output.
