Let me trace through the code with the given output "3 8 7 4".

The code reads four integers: `anti, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())`

Then calculates:
- `l = abs(anti - c)`
- `m = abs(b - d)`

Now I need to determine which branch was executed:

**Check if output came from `if anti == c`:**
This prints: `anti + m, b, c + m, d`
Positions 1 and 3 would be equal (both `anti + m`). But in output "3 8 7 4", positions 1 and 3 are 3 and 7 (not equal). ✗

**Check if output came from `elif b == d`:**
This prints: `anti, b + l, c, d + l`
Positions 2 and 4 would be equal (both `b + l`). But in output "3 8 7 4", positions 2 and 4 are 8 and 4 (not equal). ✗

**Check if output came from `elif l != m`:**
This prints: `-1`
But output is "3 8 7 4", not "-1". ✗

**Check if output came from `else`:**
This prints: `anti, d, c, b`
So:
- Position 1 (anti) = 3
- Position 2 (d) = 8  
- Position 3 (c) = 7
- Position 4 (b) = 4

This means: `anti = 3, b = 4, c = 7, d = 8`

For this branch to execute, we need:
- `anti != c` => `3 != 7` ✓
- `b != d` => `4 != 8` ✓
- `l == m` => `abs(3 - 7) == abs(4 - 8)` => `4 == 4` ✓

All conditions are satisfied!
