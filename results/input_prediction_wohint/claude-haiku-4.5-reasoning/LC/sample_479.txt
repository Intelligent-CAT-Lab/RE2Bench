[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output `[1, 2, 3]`.

The function performs two operations:
1. `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)` - removes an element at index `pop1 - 1`
2. `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)` - removes an element at index `pop2 - 1` from the already-modified list
3. Returns the modified list

Since we end up with 3 elements after removing 2 elements, the original list must have had 5 elements.

The output list is `[1, 2, 3]`. One natural choice is that these are the elements we want to keep, and we remove two additional elements.

Let me try: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with `pop1 = 4` and `pop2 = 4`

Verification:
- Start: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After `nums.pop(4 - 1) = nums.pop(3)`: removes element at index 3 (which is 4), giving `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
- After `nums.pop(4 - 1) = nums.pop(3)`: removes element at index 3 (which is 5), giving `[1, 2, 3]` ✓

This works! The two pops remove the elements at the end of the list.
