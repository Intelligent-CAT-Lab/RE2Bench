Let me trace through this code step by step to find what input produces output 57900.

The code:
1. Reads 4 space-separated integers: x, y, a, b
2. Computes lcm = LCM(x, y) using the GCD function
3. Calculates and prints: b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm = 57900

Let me understand what this formula does. It counts how many multiples of lcm fall in the range [a, b]:
- b // lcm gives the count of multiples of lcm from 1 to b
- (a-1) // lcm gives the count of multiples of lcm from 1 to a-1
- Their difference gives the count in the range [a, b]

So we need: b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm = 57900

The simplest solution would be to use lcm = 1 (when x and y have LCM = 1, which happens when both equal 1).

If x = 1, y = 1:
- GCD(1, 1): The loop condition checks if 1 % 1 != 0, which is false (1 % 1 = 0), so return 1
- LCM(1, 1) = 1 * 1 // 1 = 1

Now with lcm = 1 and if a = 1:
- b // 1 - (1-1) // 1 = b // 1 - 0 // 1 = b
- So b = 57900

Let me verify: input "1 1 1 57900"
- x=1, y=1, a=1, b=57900
- lcm = LCM(1,1) = 1
- output = 57900 // 1 - 0 // 1 = 57900 - 0 = 57900 ✓
