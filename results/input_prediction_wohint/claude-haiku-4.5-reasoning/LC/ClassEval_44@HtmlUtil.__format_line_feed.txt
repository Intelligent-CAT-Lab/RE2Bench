[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `__format_line_feed` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def __format_line_feed(text):
    return re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)
```

This function:
1. Uses regex to find one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n+`)
2. Replaces all such occurrences with a single newline (`\n`)
3. Returns the modified text

The output is: `"Some sentence here."`

This output contains no newline characters. Working backwards:
- If the input contained no newlines, the regex pattern `\n+` wouldn't match anything
- Therefore `re.sub` would return the text unchanged
- This means the input must have been exactly `"Some sentence here."` (with no newlines to compress)

Alternatively, the input could have had newlines that were later somehow removed, but the simplest and most direct explanation is that the input was identical to the output: `"Some sentence here."` with no newlines present.
