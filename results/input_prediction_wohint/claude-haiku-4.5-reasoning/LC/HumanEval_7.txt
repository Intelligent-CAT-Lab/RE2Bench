[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function and work backwards from the output.

The function `filter_by_substring` returns a list of strings from the input `strings` parameter where each string contains the `substring`.

Given output: `["grunt", "prune"]`

This means:
1. Both "grunt" and "prune" must contain the substring
2. These are the only strings that passed the filter (or the only strings in the input list)

Now I need to find what substring appears in both "grunt" and "prune":
- "grunt" contains: g, r, u, n, t, and combinations like "run", "un", "nt", etc.
- "prune" contains: p, r, u, n, e, and combinations like "run", "un", "ru", etc.

Common substrings include: "r", "u", "n", "ru", "un", "run"

The minimum valid input would be:
- `strings = ["grunt", "prune"]` (or could contain additional strings that don't include the substring)
- `substring` = any common substring. A reasonable choice is `"un"` since it meaningfully appears in both words

Let me verify: 
- "un" in "grunt" → True
- "un" in "prune" → True  
- Result: ["grunt", "prune"] ✓

This matches the expected output.
