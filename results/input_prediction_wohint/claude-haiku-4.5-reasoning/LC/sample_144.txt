[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution:

The function `f(vectors)` does the following:
1. Creates an empty list `sorted_vecs = []`
2. Iterates through each `vec` in `vectors`
3. For each `vec`, sorts it in-place and appends to `sorted_vecs`
4. Returns `sorted_vecs`

Given the output is an empty list `[]`, this means that `sorted_vecs` was never populated with any elements. 

For `sorted_vecs` to remain empty, the for loop `for vec in vectors:` must never execute any iterations. This happens when `vectors` is an empty iterable (has no elements).

Therefore, the input `vectors` must be an empty list: `vectors = []`

Let me verify:
- `vectors = []` → the for loop doesn't iterate
- `sorted_vecs` stays as `[]`
- Function returns `[]` ✓

This matches the output.
