Let me trace through the code:

1. The code reads an integer N
2. If N is even (N % 2 == 0), it prints 0.5
3. If N is odd, it prints (N + 1) / N / 2

The output is `0.5050505050505051`, which is not exactly `0.5`.

Since the output is not `0.5`, this means N must be odd, and we're in the else branch.

So I need to solve: (N + 1) / N / 2 = 0.5050505050505051

Simplifying the expression:
(N + 1) / N / 2 = (N + 1) / (2N)

Setting this equal to the output:
(N + 1) / (2N) = 0.5050505050505051

Rearranging:
N + 1 = 0.5050505050505051 × 2N
N + 1 = 1.0101010101010102N
1 = 0.0101010101010102N
N = 1 / 0.0101010101010102 ≈ 99

Let me verify: N = 99 is odd ✓
(99 + 1) / 99 / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = 100/198 = 50/99 ≈ 0.5050505050505051 ✓

This matches the output perfectly.
