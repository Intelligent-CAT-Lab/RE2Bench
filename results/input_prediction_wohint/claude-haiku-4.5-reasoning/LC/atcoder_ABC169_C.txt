Let me trace through the code backwards from the output.

Given: `print(a * b // 100)` outputs `2017634310362021`

This means: `a * b // 100 = 2017634310362021`
Therefore: `a * b = 2017634310362021 * 100 = 201763431036202100`

Now I need to find values of `a` (as a string) and `b_orig` (original b string from input) such that:
1. `b = int(b_orig[0] + b_orig[2:])` (removes second character from b_orig)
2. `a = int(a)` (a is converted to int)
3. `a * b = 201763431036202100`

Let me try a simple approach: what if `a = 100`?
Then: `b = 201763431036202100 / 100 = 2017634310362021`

If the final value of `b` after transformation is `2017634310362021`, and this comes from:
`b = b_orig[0] + b_orig[2:]`

Then I need `b_orig` where removing the character at index 1 gives `2017634310362021`.

If `b_orig = "20017634310362021"` (17 digits):
- `b_orig[0]` = "2"
- `b_orig[2:]` = "017634310362021" (everything from index 2 onward)
- `b = "2" + "017634310362021" = "2017634310362021"` ✓

Let me verify the complete execution:
- Input: `"100 20017634310362021"`
- After split: `a = "100"`, `b = "20017634310362021"`
- After b transformation: `b = "2" + "017634310362021" = "2017634310362021"`
- After int conversion: `a = 100`, `b = 2017634310362021`
- Computation: `100 * 2017634310362021 // 100 = 2017634310362021` ✓
