[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `double_the_difference(lst)`:

1. It creates a list comprehension that squares each element `i` from the list
2. But only if ALL three conditions are true:
   - `i > 0` (positive)
   - `i % 2 != 0` (odd)
   - `'.' not in str(i)` (no decimal point, so it's an integer)
3. It returns the sum of all squared values

The output is 0, which means the sum is 0.

Since we're summing squares of positive numbers (which would all be positive), the only way to get a sum of 0 is if:
- The list is empty (no elements to sum), OR
- No elements in the list satisfy ALL three conditions

The simplest case is an empty list `[]`, which would result in:
- The list comprehension produces an empty list
- `sum([])` returns 0

I could also consider other cases like `[2, 4, 6]` (all even, so they fail the odd check) or `[-1, -3]` (all negative, so they fail the positive check), but the empty list is the most straightforward answer.
