[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution with the given output.

The function `f` has two branches:
1. If `encryption == 0`: returns the `string` parameter unchanged
2. If `encryption != 0`: returns `string.upper().encode('rot13')`

The output is `"UppEr"`, which is a string.

Important observation: The second branch would return `string.upper().encode('rot13')`, which calls `.encode()`. This method returns bytes, not a string. However, the output shown is a regular JSON string `"UppEr"`, not a bytes representation (which would typically show as `b'...'` or similar).

This strongly suggests the output comes from the first branch where `encryption == 0`.

If `encryption == 0`, the function simply returns the input `string` unchanged.

Therefore: if the output is `"UppEr"`, then the input `string` must have been `"UppEr"`.

For `encryption`, since the first branch is taken, `encryption == 0`.

Let me verify: `f("UppEr", 0)` → since `encryption == 0` → returns `"UppEr"` ✓
