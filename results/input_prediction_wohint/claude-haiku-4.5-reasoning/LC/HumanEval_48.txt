[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `is_palindrome` function to understand what input would produce `False`.

The function compares characters from both ends of the string moving inward:
- For each index `i` from 0 to len(text)-1
- It checks if `text[i] == text[len(text) - 1 - i]`
- If ANY pair of characters don't match, it returns `False`
- If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`

Since the output is `False`, this means the function found at least one pair of characters that don't match, meaning the input string is NOT a palindrome.

The simplest non-palindromic string would be "ab":
- i=0: text[0]='a', text[len("ab")-1-0]=text[1]='b'
- 'a' != 'b' → immediately returns `False` ✓

This matches the expected output of `False`.

Other valid inputs could be "hello", "abc", "xy", or any non-palindromic string, but "ab" is the simplest case.
