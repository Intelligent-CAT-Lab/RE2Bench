[THOUGHT]
The `delete_from_database` method:
1. Takes `table_name` and `name` as parameters
2. Connects to a SQLite database via `self.database_name`
3. Executes a DELETE query to remove records where `name` matches the parameter
4. Commits the transaction and closes the connection
5. Has no explicit return statement, so implicitly returns `None` (which is `null` in JSON)

The output being `null` is consistent with the function's behavior - it always returns `None` regardless of how many records were deleted (0, 1, or many).

The function would work with any valid database name, table name, and name value to delete from. A reasonable example would be:
- database_name: some database file
- table_name: a table that exists in the database (e.g., "users")
- name: a name value to delete (e.g., "Alice")
