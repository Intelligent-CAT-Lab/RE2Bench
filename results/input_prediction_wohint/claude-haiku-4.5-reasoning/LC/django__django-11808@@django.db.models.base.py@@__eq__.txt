[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `__eq__` method, I need to trace through the logic to find what inputs would produce `True`:

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, Model):
        return NotImplemented
    if self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model:
        return False
    my_pk = self.pk
    if my_pk is None:
        return self is other
    return my_pk == other.pk
```

For the output to be `True`, one of these conditions must be met:

1. **Case 1**: `my_pk is None` AND `self is other` (same object reference)
2. **Case 2**: `my_pk is not None` AND `my_pk == other.pk` (same pk values)

For Case 2 (the most straightforward):
- `other` must be a `Model` instance (passes `isinstance` check)
- Both `self` and `other` must have the same `_meta.concrete_model` 
- Both must have the same non-None `pk` value

The `pk` property calls `_get_pk_val()`, which returns `getattr(self, meta.pk.attname)`. So if `meta.pk.attname` is "id", it accesses the `id` attribute.

The simplest input would be two Model instances of the same type (e.g., User) with the same pk value (e.g., 1):
- `self` is a User instance with id=1
- `other` is a User instance with id=1
- Comparison: 1 == 1 → True
