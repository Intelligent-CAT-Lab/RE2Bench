Let me trace through the function backwards from the output.

The function returns `s` at the end, so the final value of `s` must be `"."` (a single dot).

The function:
1. Calculates `width = len(c) * n`
2. Runs a loop `width - len(s)` times
3. In each iteration, prepends `c` to `s`

Since the output is just `"."` (length 1), I need to find values where this is the result.

**Simplest case: The loop doesn't run at all**
- This happens when `width - len(s) = 0`
- Which means `len(c) * n = len(s)`
- If `s = "."` initially, then `len(s) = 1`
- So we need `len(c) * n = 1`

If `n = 1` and `c = "."` (a single character):
- `width = len(".") * 1 = 1`
- Loop runs `1 - 1 = 0` times
- `s` remains `"."`
- Function returns `"."`

This works! Let me verify:
- Initial: `s = "."`, `n = 1`, `c = "."`
- `width = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `for _ in range(1 - 1)`: loop doesn't execute
- Return `"."`  ✓

**Alternative case: Single iteration of the loop**
- If `s = ""` initially, `c = "."`, `n = 1`:
- `width = 1 * 1 = 1`
- Loop runs `1 - 0 = 1` time
- `s = "." + "" = "."`
- This also works!

I'll go with the simpler first case.
