[THOUGHT]
Looking at the function:
```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    return [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]
```

The function creates a list with `n` elements, where each element at position `i` (from 0 to n-1) is calculated as `n + 2*i`.

Given output: `[3, 5, 7]`

Working backwards:
- The output has 3 elements, so `range(n)` must produce 3 values, meaning `n = 3`
- For `i = 0`: `3 + 2*0 = 3` ✓
- For `i = 1`: `3 + 2*1 = 5` ✓  
- For `i = 2`: `3 + 2*2 = 7` ✓

Therefore, the input parameter `n` must be `3`.
