[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function with the given output.

The function `f` takes an `array` parameter and:
1. Maps each number in `array` to a string of 'n' repeated that many times: `just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array))`
2. Initializes an empty `final_output` list
3. Loops through `just_ns` and appends each element to `final_output`
4. Returns `final_output`

Given that the output is `[]` (an empty list):
- The returned `final_output` is empty
- This means either `just_ns` was empty (so the for loop had nothing to iterate over)
- If `just_ns` is empty, then `map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array)` must have produced an empty list
- The `map()` function produces an empty iterable only when `array` itself is empty

Therefore, if `array = []`:
- `just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, []))` = `[]`
- The for loop doesn't execute
- `final_output` remains `[]`
- The function returns `[]`, which matches the expected output

Notably, `array` could also contain values like `[0]` (since `'n' * 0` = `''`), but the simplest and most logical answer is an empty array.
