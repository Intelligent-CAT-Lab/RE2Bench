Looking at the code:
```python
vamshi, z = map(int, input().split())
print((vamshi // z + 1) * z)
```

Given the output is `15`, I need to find values of `vamshi` and `z` such that:
```
(vamshi // z + 1) * z = 15
```

This formula computes the next multiple of `z` that is strictly greater than `vamshi`.

Let me work backwards from the output:
- For the result to be `15`, `z` must be a divisor of 15
- Divisors of 15 are: 1, 3, 5, 15

Let me test `z = 5`:
- `(vamshi // 5 + 1) * 5 = 15`
- `vamshi // 5 + 1 = 3`
- `vamshi // 5 = 2`
- This means `10 <= vamshi < 15`

Let me verify with `vamshi = 10, z = 5`:
- `(10 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (2 + 1) * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15` ✓

This works! The next multiple of 5 after 10 is indeed 15.

Other valid solutions would include:
- `vamshi = 0, z = 15`: `(0 // 15 + 1) * 15 = 1 * 15 = 15` ✓
- `vamshi = 12, z = 3`: `(12 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15` ✓
- `vamshi = 14, z = 1`: `(14 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 15 * 1 = 15` ✓

I'll select `vamshi = 10, z = 5` as it's a natural, balanced solution.
