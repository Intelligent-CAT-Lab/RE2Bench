[THOUGHT]
The function `add` is straightforward - it takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns their sum.

Given that the output is 1223, I need to find values of `x` and `y` such that:
x + y = 1223

Since the function is deterministic but underdetermined (multiple input pairs sum to 1223), any pair of integers that sum to 1223 would be valid. Some examples:
- x = 0, y = 1223
- x = 1223, y = 0
- x = 611, y = 612
- x = 1000, y = 223

I'll select x = 1000 and y = 223 as a reasonable choice with relatively round numbers.
