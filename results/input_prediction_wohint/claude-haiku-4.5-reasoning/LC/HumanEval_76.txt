Let me trace through the function `is_simple_power(x, n)` to understand what inputs produce `true`.

The function returns `true` in two scenarios:

1. If `n == 1`: The function returns `x == 1`. So if n=1, we need x=1.

2. If `n != 1`: 
   - The function starts `power = 1`
   - It multiplies `power` by `n` in a loop while `power < x`
   - It returns `true` if after the loop, `power == x`
   - This means x must be a power of n

Let me verify with x=2, n=2:
- n == 1? No
- power = 1
- Loop iteration 1: power < x? (1 < 2? Yes) → power = 1 * 2 = 2
- Loop iteration 2: power < x? (2 < 2? No) → exit loop
- Return: power == x? (2 == 2? Yes) → **true** ✓

Another simple case with x=8, n=2:
- n == 1? No
- power = 1
- power gets multiplied by 2: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8
- When power = 8, the condition power < x (8 < 8) is false, so we exit
- Return: 8 == 8 → **true** ✓

Or the simplest case with x=1, n=1:
- n == 1? Yes
- Return: x == 1? (1 == 1? Yes) → **true** ✓

I'll use x=2, n=2 as a straightforward example where 2 is 2 to the power of 1.
