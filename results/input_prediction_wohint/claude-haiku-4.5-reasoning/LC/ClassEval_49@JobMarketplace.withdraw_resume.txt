[THOUGHT]
The `withdraw_resume` method performs a simple operation:
1. It takes a `resume` parameter
2. It removes that resume from `self.resumes` using the `list.remove()` method
3. It returns `None` implicitly

The output is `null` (which represents `None` in JSON), confirming that the method executed successfully and returned nothing (None).

For this method to execute without error:
- The `resume` parameter must exist in `self.resumes` list (otherwise `remove()` would raise a ValueError)
- After removal, the method implicitly returns `None`

Since the method returns `None`, I need to provide valid input where:
1. `self` is an instance with initialized `job_listings` (empty list from __init__) and `resumes` (containing at least the resume being removed)
2. The `resume` argument must be an element that exists in `self.resumes`

A simple solution is to use a string identifier for the resume.
