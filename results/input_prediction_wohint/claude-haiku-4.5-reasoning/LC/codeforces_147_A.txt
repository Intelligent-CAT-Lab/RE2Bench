[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step, working backwards from the output to understand what input produces "x. x".

The code does three main operations:
1. Adds a space after punctuation marks (,.?!)
2. Normalizes whitespace (removes extra spaces, maintains single spaces between tokens)
3. Removes spaces before punctuation marks

Working backwards to find the input:

**After step 3 (final):** s = "x. x"

**Before step 3:** The last loop removes spaces before punctuation (replaces ' .' with '.', etc.).
Since the final output is "x. x" and there's no space before the period, the input to step 3 must also be "x. x" (no change would occur).

**Before step 2:** The normalization step `s = ' '.join(s.strip().split())` takes any whitespace configuration and normalizes it to single spaces between tokens. For it to produce "x. x", step 1 must have produced either:
- "x. x" (unlikely, since step 1 adds spaces)
- "x.  x" (with multiple spaces)
- Other whitespace variations

**Before step 1 (the actual input):** Step 1 replaces each punctuation mark with itself plus a space. So '.' becomes '. '

If the input was "x.x", then:
- Step 1: "x.x".replace('.', '. ') = "x. x"
- Step 2: "x. x".split() = ['x.', 'x'], then ' '.join() = "x. x"  
- Step 3: "x. x" has no " ." pattern, so nothing changes = "x. x" ✓

Let me verify this complete trace:

**Input: "x.x"**
- Step 1: Replace '.' with '. ' → "x. x"
- Step 2: Strip and split on whitespace → ['x.', 'x'], join → "x. x"
- Step 3: Remove " ." → "x. x" (no such pattern exists)
- **Output: "x. x"** ✓
