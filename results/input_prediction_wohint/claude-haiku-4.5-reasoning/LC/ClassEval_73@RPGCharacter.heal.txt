[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `heal` method to find what initial `self.hp` value produces an output of 100.

The heal method:
```python
def heal(self):
    self.hp += 10
    if self.hp > 100:
        self.hp = 100
    return self.hp
```

For the output to be 100, the final `self.hp` must be 100.

This can happen in two scenarios:
1. `self.hp + 10 = 100` exactly (then the if condition `self.hp > 100` is False, no capping needed)
   - This requires `self.hp = 90`
2. `self.hp + 10 > 100` (then it gets capped to 100)
   - This requires `self.hp > 90`

So the original `self.hp` must be in the range [90, 100].

Let me verify with hp = 95:
- `self.hp += 10` → self.hp becomes 105
- `if 105 > 100:` → True, so set self.hp = 100
- `return 100` ✓

For the other instance variables set in `__init__`, I'll use reasonable RPG character values:
- name: "Warrior"
- attack_power: 10
- defense: 5
- level: 1 (the default)
- exp: 0 (initialized in __init__)

Since heal() takes no arguments besides self, args and kwargs are empty.
