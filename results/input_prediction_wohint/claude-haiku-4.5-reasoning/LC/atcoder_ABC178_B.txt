Let me trace through the code with the given output.

The code:
1. Reads 4 integers: a, b, c, d
2. Calculates the maximum of four products: a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d
3. Prints this maximum value

Given output: 56183721947132200

So I need to find values a, b, c, d such that:
max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d) = 56183721947132200

Let me consider the structure of these four products. Mathematically, this simplifies to:
max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d) = max(a, b) × max(c, d)

This means the result equals the product of the maximum value from {a, b} and the maximum value from {c, d}.

So I need: max(a, b) × max(c, d) = 56183721947132200

The simplest factorization is to use:
- max(a, b) = 1, which means a ≤ 1 and b ≤ 1
- max(c, d) = 56183721947132200, which means c ≤ 56183721947132200 and d ≤ 56183721947132200

The simplest values satisfying these constraints would be:
- a = 1, b = 1
- c = 1, d = 56183721947132200

Let me verify:
- a*c = 1 × 1 = 1
- a*d = 1 × 56183721947132200 = 56183721947132200
- b*c = 1 × 1 = 1
- b*d = 1 × 56183721947132200 = 56183721947132200
- max(1, 56183721947132200, 1, 56183721947132200) = 56183721947132200 ✓

This matches the output!
