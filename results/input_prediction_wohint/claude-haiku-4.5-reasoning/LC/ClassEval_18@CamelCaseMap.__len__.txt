[THOUGHT]
The `__len__` method returns `len(self._data)`, where `self._data` is a dictionary.

Given the output is 0, this means `len(self._data)` returned 0.

The only way a dictionary's length is 0 is if it's empty: `len({})` = 0.

In the `__init__` method, `self._data` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.

Therefore, to get an output of 0 from `__len__`, the `CamelCaseMap` instance must have an empty `_data` dictionary (no items added to it).

The `__len__` method takes no arguments besides `self`, so `args` should be empty.
