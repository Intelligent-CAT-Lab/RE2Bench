[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution backwards:

The function:
1. Makes a copy of input dictionary `d`
2. Calls `popitem()` on the copy, which removes one item (in Python 3.7+, removes the last inserted item)
3. Returns the modified dictionary

The output is: `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`

Working backwards:
- Before `popitem()` is executed, the dictionary must have contained `{"l": 1, "t": 2}` plus one additional key-value pair
- This additional item must have been the last item in insertion order (since `popitem()` removes the last item in Python 3.7+)
- After `popitem()` removes that last item, we're left with `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`

So the input dictionary `d` must have had exactly 3 items: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, ...}` where the third key-value pair was inserted last and then removed by `popitem()`.

A valid input would be any dictionary like: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x": 0}` (the specific value of the third item doesn't matter).

Let me verify: 
- Input: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x": 0}`
- After copy: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x": 0}` 
- After popitem(): `{"l": 1, "t": 2}` ✓
- This matches the expected output
