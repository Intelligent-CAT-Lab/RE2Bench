[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function backwards from the given output.

The function returns the last `k` elements of a sorted array:
```python
arr.sort()
ans = arr[-k:]
return ans
```

Given output: `[-4, 4]`

This output has 2 elements, so `k = 2` (since `arr[-2:]` returns the last 2 elements).

After sorting, the last 2 elements of the array must be `[-4, 4]`.

This means the sorted array should look like: `[..., -4, 4]`, where all elements before `-4` would be <= `-4`.

Working backwards:
- The sorted array ending with `[-4, 4]` means these are the 2 largest elements
- The original unsorted `arr` could have been any permutation of elements that, when sorted, ends with `[-4, 4]`

The simplest valid input would be:
- `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`

Let me verify:
```
arr = [-4, 4], k = 2
k == 0? No
arr.sort() → [-4, 4]
ans = arr[-2:] → [-4, 4]
return [-4, 4] ✓
```
