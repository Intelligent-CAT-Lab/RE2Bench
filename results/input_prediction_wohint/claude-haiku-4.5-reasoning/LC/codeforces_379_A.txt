Let me trace through this code step by step to understand what it does and work backwards from the output.

The code:
1. Reads two integers `a` and `b`
2. First while loop: increments `h` and `s` by `a` (runs `a` times)
   - After this loop: `h = a`, `s = a`
3. Second while loop: continues while `s // b != 0` (i.e., while `s >= b`)
   - Each iteration: `h += 1`, `s = s - b + 1`
   - So in each iteration, `s` decreases by `(b - 1)`
4. Prints `h`

Given output `h = 80`, I need to find `a` and `b`.

Let me denote the number of iterations of the second loop as `k`. Then:
- After first loop: `h = a`, `s = a`  
- After k iterations of second loop: `h = a + k`, `s = a - k(b-1)`
- The loop stops when `s < b`

So: `a + k = 80`, which means `k = 80 - a`

**Simplest case: Second loop doesn't execute at all**
If `a < b`, then `s // b = 0` initially, so the second loop never runs.
- Therefore: `h = a = 80`
- We need `b > a = 80`
- Simplest choice: `a = 80, b = 81`

Let me verify with `a = 80, b = 81`:
- First loop: runs 80 times → `h = 80, s = 80`
- Second loop condition: `80 // 81 = 0`, so loop doesn't execute
- Output: `h = 80` ✓

This is the simplest solution.

**Alternative case: Second loop executes once**
If `a = 79, b = 41`:
- First loop: `h = 79, s = 79`
- Second loop iteration 1: `79 // 41 = 1 ≠ 0`, so execute → `h = 80, s = 79 - 41 + 1 = 39`
- Second loop check: `39 // 41 = 0`, so exit
- Output: `h = 80` ✓

This also works, but is more complex.

The simplest solution is `a = 80, b = 81`.
