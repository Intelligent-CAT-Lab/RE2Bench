[THOUGHT]
The function `compare` takes two sequences `game` and `guess`, and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements using `zip`.

Given output: `[2, 0, 0, 1]`

This means:
- `|game[0] - guess[0]| = 2`
- `|game[1] - guess[1]| = 0`
- `|game[2] - guess[2]| = 0`
- `|game[3] - guess[3]| = 1`

For the absolute differences to work out:
- Position 0: The two values must differ by 2. For example: game[0]=1, guess[0]=3 (or 0,2 or 3,1, etc.)
- Position 1: The values must be equal (difference of 0). For example: both 2
- Position 2: The values must be equal (difference of 0). For example: both 3
- Position 3: The values must differ by 1. For example: game[3]=4, guess[3]=3 (or 3,4, etc.)

A simple valid solution would be:
- game = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- guess = [3, 2, 3, 3]

Verification: |1-3|=2, |2-2|=0, |3-3|=0, |4-3|=1 ✓
