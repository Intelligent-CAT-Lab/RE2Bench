[THOUGHT]
To determine what input to `morsel_to_cookie` would produce an output of `null`, I need to trace through the function and identify what could cause it to not return normally.

Looking at the function:
```python
def morsel_to_cookie(morsel):
    expires = None
    if morsel['max-age']:
        try:
            expires = int(time.time() + int(morsel['max-age']))
        except ValueError:
            raise TypeError(f'max-age: {morsel['max-age']} must be integer')
    elif morsel['expires']:
        time_template = '%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT'
        expires = calendar.timegm(time.strptime(morsel['expires'], time_template))
    return create_cookie(...)
```

The function always attempts to return a `create_cookie(...)` result. For the output to be `null`, an exception must be raised somewhere.

Key observation: The function accesses `morsel['max-age']` on the first line within the if statement. 

If `morsel` is `None`:
- Line `if morsel['max-age']:` would raise `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`
- The exception propagates up
- The function doesn't return a valid Cookie object
- The output is represented as `null`

This is the most direct path to a `null` output. The function has no exception handling to gracefully handle a null/None morsel, so it would raise an exception immediately.

Other possibilities that would also produce `null`:
- `morsel` is an empty dict or missing required keys (would raise KeyError)
- `morsel['expires']` has invalid date format (would raise ValueError in strptime)
- `morsel` doesn't have `.key` or `.value` attributes (would raise AttributeError)

However, `morsel = None` is the simplest and most direct input that would cause the function to fail with a null output.
