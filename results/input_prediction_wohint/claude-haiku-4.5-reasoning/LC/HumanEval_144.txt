[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what inputs would return `True`:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    a, b = x.split('/')          # Split x by '/'
    c, d = n.split('/')          # Split n by '/'
    numerator = int(a) * int(c)  # Multiply the first parts
    denom = int(b) * int(d)      # Multiply the second parts
    if numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom):  # Check if division is a whole number
        return True
    return False
```

The function returns `True` when `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)`. This condition is true when the division results in a whole number (no fractional part).

For example, if:
- numerator = 2 and denom = 1: 2/1 = 2.0 and int(2/1) = 2, so 2.0 == 2 is True ✓
- numerator = 4 and denom = 2: 4/2 = 2.0 and int(4/2) = 2, so 2.0 == 2 is True ✓

The simplest case would be x = "1/1" and n = "1/1":
- a = "1", b = "1", c = "1", d = "1"
- numerator = 1 * 1 = 1
- denom = 1 * 1 = 1
- 1 / 1 = 1.0 and int(1 / 1) = 1
- 1.0 == 1 is True ✓
- Returns `True` ✓
