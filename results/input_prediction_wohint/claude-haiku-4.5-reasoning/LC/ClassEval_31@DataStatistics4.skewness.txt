Let me trace through the skewness calculation to find what input produces output 0.

The skewness formula returns 0 in two cases:
1. When `std_deviation == 0` (all values are identical)
2. When `sum(((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data)) == 0` (symmetric distribution)

**Case 1: Constant list** like `[1, 1, 1]`
- n = 3, mean = 1
- variance = 0 → std_deviation = 0
- Formula returns 0 directly (before division)

**Case 2: Symmetric distribution** like `[1, 2, 3]`
- n = 3
- mean = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2
- variance = ((1-2)² + (2-2)² + (3-2)²) / 3 = 2/3
- std_deviation = √(2/3) > 0 (non-zero, so we calculate the formula)
- sum of cubes = (1-2)³ + (2-2)³ + (3-2)³ = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
- numerator = 0 × 3 = 0
- skewness = 0 / (2 × 1 × √(2/3)³) = 0 ✓

Let me verify [1, 2, 3] produces exactly 0:
- The sum of deviations cubed is exactly 0 (perfect symmetry)
- 0 divided by any non-zero denominator equals 0

This works!
