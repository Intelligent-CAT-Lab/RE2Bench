[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function:

```python
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for num in range(2, count):
        nums.sort()
    return nums
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The function gets the length of `nums` into `count`
2. It loops through `range(2, count)` and calls `nums.sort()` each iteration
3. Returns the modified `nums`

Key observations:
- For the loop to execute, we need `count > 2` (otherwise `range(2, count)` is empty)
- Each iteration calls `nums.sort()`, which sorts the list in-place
- The output `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` is sorted
- The output has 5 elements

Working backwards:
- Output is sorted: `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`
- Since the function sorts the list and the output is sorted, the input must contain the same elements but possibly in a different order
- The input must have 5 elements (same as output, since the function doesn't add/remove elements)
- For the loop to execute at least once: `len(nums) > 2`, which is satisfied by 5 elements

Therefore, the input is any permutation of `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`. A reasonable example would be a reversed order like `[2, -5, -6, -7, -8]`.

Verification:
- Input: `[2, -5, -6, -7, -8]`
- count = 5
- Loop iterations (num = 2, 3, 4): each iteration calls sort()
- After first sort: `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` ✓
- Subsequent sorts maintain this order
- Return: `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` ✓
