[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function backwards from the output.

The function returns `[note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]`

The output is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is a list of four 1's.

Looking at the note_map: `{'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}`, the only key that maps to 1 is `'.|'`.

So the list comprehension must iterate over exactly 4 elements, each of which is `'.|'`.

The comprehension processes: `music_string.split(' ')` and filters with `if x` (which removes empty strings).

Working backwards:
- We need 4 non-empty results from the split
- Each result must be `'.|'`
- The split is done on `' '` (single space)

Therefore, the music_string should be: `'.| .| .| .|'` (four `'.|'` tokens separated by single spaces).

Let me verify:
- `'.| .| .| .|'.split(' ')` → `['.|', '.|', '.|', '.|']`
- All elements are non-empty (pass the `if x` test)
- `note_map['.|']` = 1 for each
- Result: `[1, 1, 1, 1]` ✓
