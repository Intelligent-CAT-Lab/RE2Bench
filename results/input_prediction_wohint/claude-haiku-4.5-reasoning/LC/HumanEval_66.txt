[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the `digitSum` function:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input
2. If `s == ''`, it returns 0
3. Otherwise, it uses a generator expression to sum `ord(char)` for all characters where `char.isupper()` is True
4. For all other characters (lowercase, digits, symbols), it adds 0

Given the output is 327, I need to find a string where the ASCII values of all uppercase letters sum to 327.

Let me think about what uppercase letters could sum to 327. ASCII values for uppercase letters are:
- Z = 90 (highest)
- A = 65 (lowest)

If I use combinations:
- Z + Z + ? + ? = 180 + ? = 327, so I need two more letters summing to 147
- This could be: R(82) + A(65) = 147
- So: Z(90) + Z(90) + R(82) + A(65) = 180 + 147 = 327 ✓

The arrangement of these four letters is {R, A, Z, Z}, which spells "RAZZ" - a real English word meaning to tease or heckle!

Let me verify: R(82) + A(65) + Z(90) + Z(90) = 327 ✓

Note: The input could also contain lowercase letters or other non-uppercase characters since they would contribute 0 to the sum, but the simplest form is just "RAZZ".
