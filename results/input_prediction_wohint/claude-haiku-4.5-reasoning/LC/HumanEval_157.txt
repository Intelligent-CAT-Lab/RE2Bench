[THOUGHT]
The function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` returns `True` if at least one of these conditions is satisfied:
1. `a * a == b * b + c * c` (a is the hypotenuse)
2. `b * b == a * a + c * c` (b is the hypotenuse)  
3. `c * c == a * a + b * b` (c is the hypotenuse)

These conditions check if the three values satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, meaning they could form a right-angled triangle.

Given the output is `true`, I need to find values of a, b, c where at least one of these conditions holds.

The most famous right-angled triangle is the 3-4-5 triangle where: 3² + 4² = 5²
So: 9 + 16 = 25

Let me verify with a=3, b=4, c=5:
- a * a == b * b + c * c → 9 == 16 + 25 → 9 == 41 → False
- b * b == a * a + c * c → 16 == 9 + 25 → 16 == 34 → False
- c * c == a * a + b * b → 25 == 9 + 16 → 25 == 25 → True ✓

The function would return True because the third condition is satisfied. This is the Pythagorean theorem: 5² = 3² + 4²
