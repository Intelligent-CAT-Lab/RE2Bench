[THOUGHT]
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` returns `True` when two conditions are both satisfied:
1. `n % 2 == 0` (n must be even)
2. `n >= 8` (n must be greater than or equal to 8)

Since the output is `true`, both conditions must be met. I need to find a value of `n` that is:
- Even (divisible by 2)
- Greater than or equal to 8

The simplest such value is `n = 8`:
- `8 % 2 == 0` → `True` (8 is even)
- `8 >= 8` → `True` (8 equals 8)
- `True and True` → `True` ✓

Any even number >= 8 would satisfy this (8, 10, 12, 14, etc.), but 8 is the minimum valid input.
