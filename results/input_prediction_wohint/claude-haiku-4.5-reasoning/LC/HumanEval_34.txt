[THOUGHT]
The function `unique` performs the following operations:
1. `set(l)` - removes duplicates
2. `list(...)` - converts back to a list
3. `sorted(...)` - sorts the list in ascending order

The output is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]` which is a sorted list.

Working backwards:
- After `sorted()` is applied, we get `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`
- Before that, `list(set(l))` was called, which converted a set back to a list
- The set must have contained the unique elements: `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`
- Before the set conversion, the original list `l` could have been in any order and could have contained duplicate values

Any input list that contains exactly the elements 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 123 (in any order, with any number of duplicates) would produce this output.

For example, a simple valid input would be an unsorted version: `[5, 0, 123, 2, 9, 3]` or a version with duplicates: `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123, 0, 2]` or many other permutations.

I'll provide a list that's out of order to demonstrate the sorting operation.
