[THOUGHT]
The `add_item` method in the VendingMachine class:
1. Calls `self.restock_item(item_name, quantity)` which returns True if the item already exists in inventory, False otherwise
2. If `restock_item` returns False (item doesn't exist), it adds the item with the given price and quantity
3. If `restock_item` returns True (item already exists), it does nothing more
4. The method implicitly returns None

Since the output is `None`, this is consistent with either scenario - whether the item was newly added or was already in inventory. For a straightforward case, the vending machine would start with an empty inventory, and we're adding a new item to it.

Walking through with a simple input:
- Start with empty inventory and balance 0
- Call `add_item(self, "Soda", 1.5, 10)`
- `restock_item("Soda", 10)` returns False (Soda not in inventory)
- Since it returns False, the condition `if not False` is True
- New item "Soda" is added to inventory with price 1.5 and quantity 10
- Method returns None (implicit)
