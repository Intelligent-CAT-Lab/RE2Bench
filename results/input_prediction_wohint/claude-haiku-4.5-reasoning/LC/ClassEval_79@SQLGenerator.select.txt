Let me trace through the `select` method to work backwards from the output:

Output: "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"

Breaking down the output:
1. `SELECT *` - The asterisk appears when `fields is None`, which triggers `fields = '*'`
2. `FROM table1` - This is the table name, so `self.table_name = 'table1'`
3. `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20` - This appears because `condition` is not None, so `condition = 'age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`
4. The semicolon is appended at the end with `+ ';'`

Let me verify by executing:
- `fields=None` → inner `if` sets `fields = '*'`
- `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'` → `'SELECT * FROM table1'`
- `condition` is not None → `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'` → adds `' WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`
- Returns `sql + ';'` → `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;'` ✓

This matches the expected output!
