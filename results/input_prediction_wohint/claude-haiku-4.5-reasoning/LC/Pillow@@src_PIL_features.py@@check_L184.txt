[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `check` function to determine what input would return `True`:

```python
def check(feature):
    if feature in modules:
        return check_module(feature)
    if feature in codecs:
        return check_codec(feature)
    if feature in features:
        return check_feature(feature)
    warnings.warn(f"Unknown feature '{feature}'.", stacklevel=2)
    return False
```

For the function to return `True`, one of three paths must be taken:

1. **Via `check_module`**: If `feature in modules`, it tries to `__import__(module)` and returns `True` if successful (no ModuleNotFoundError/ImportError).

2. **Via `check_codec`**: If `feature in codecs`, it checks if `codec + "_encoder"` is in `dir(Image.core)`, returning `True` if found.

3. **Via `check_feature`**: If `feature in features`, it imports a module and returns `getattr(imported_module, flag)`, which would be `True` if that attribute is truthy.

The simplest case would be a module that's generally available. Looking at Pillow's typical feature checks, common modules/features include "webp", "jpeg", "zlib", "libtiff", etc.

To produce output `True`, I'll assume the feature is a commonly available module like "webp" that would successfully pass the module import check.
