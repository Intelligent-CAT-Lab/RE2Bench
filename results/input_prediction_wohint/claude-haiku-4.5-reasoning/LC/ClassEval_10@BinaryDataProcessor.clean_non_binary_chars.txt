[THOUGHT]
The `clean_non_binary_chars` method only takes `self` as a parameter (no additional arguments). Looking at the code:

```python
def clean_non_binary_chars(self):
    self.binary_string = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string))
```

This method:
1. Filters `self.binary_string` to keep only characters '0' and '1'
2. Does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns `None` (which is `null` in JSON)

The output being `null` is expected because the method doesn't return anything - it only modifies the instance variable `self.binary_string` internally.

Since the output doesn't reveal the original value of `self.binary_string` (the method always returns `null` regardless of input), any valid string would work as input. A reasonable example would be a simple binary string or one with non-binary characters that get filtered out.

Let me use a simple case with mixed characters:
- Input: `"1a0b1"` 
- After filtering: `"101"` (non-binary 'a' and 'b' removed)
- Method returns: `None` (output: `null`)
