[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function backwards from the output.

The function `next_smallest` does the following:
1. Removes duplicates by converting to a set and sorts: `sorted(set(lst))`
2. Returns `None` if the length is less than 2
3. Otherwise returns the element at index 1 (the second smallest element)

Given that the output is `2` (not `None`):
- The condition `len(lst) < 2` must be False, meaning the sorted unique list has at least 2 elements
- The return value `lst[1] = 2` means the second element of the sorted, deduplicated list is exactly 2

So after removing duplicates and sorting, the list must look like: `[first_element, 2, ...]` where `first_element < 2`.

The simplest input that produces this output would be a list where:
- After deduplication and sorting, we get at least `[some_value, 2]`
- The smallest value could be 1, 0, -1, etc.

The most straightforward input is `[1, 2]`:
1. `sorted(set([1, 2]))` = `[1, 2]`
2. `len([1, 2])` = 2, which is not < 2
3. Return `[1, 2][1]` = `2` ✓

Alternatively, `[2, 1]` or `[1, 1, 2]` would also work due to the sorting and deduplication steps.
