[THOUGHT]
Let me work backwards from the output to determine the input.

The output is a tuple with three elements:
1. `mat`: [-9, -17, -19, 0, -8, -37, 0, 0, -243]
2. `pivot_cols`: [0, 1, 2] 
3. `swaps`: []

**Determining matrix dimensions:**
- 9 elements total with 3 pivot columns suggests a 3×3 matrix
- Layout as rows: Row 0: [-9, -17, -19], Row 1: [0, -8, -37], Row 2: [0, 0, -243]
- This is upper triangular with pivots at positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)

**Understanding the no-swap condition:**
- `swaps=[]` means no row swaps occurred
- This is consistent with an input matrix already having pivots properly positioned
- The simplest input satisfying this is one already in row echelon form

**Determining normalization flags:**
Looking at the normalization logic:
- If `normalize_last is False`, pivots get normalized to `one` during the main loop (code: `if normalize_last is False or not pivot_val.is_commutative`)
- If `normalize_last is True and normalize is True`, pivots get normalized to `one` after the main loop

Since the output shows -9, -8, -243 on the diagonal (not 1), the pivots were NOT normalized. This means:
- `normalize_last = True` (to avoid intermediate normalization)
- `normalize = False` (to avoid final normalization)

**Determining other parameters:**
- `rows = 3`, `cols = 3` (based on matrix structure)
- `mat` = the given output values (simplest case is input already in this form)
- `one = 1` (standard identity element)
- `zero_above = True` (default, maintains zeros above pivots)
- `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc` would be the standard functions from the module (e.g., `_iszero` and `_simplify`)

**Input matrix interpretation:**
The fact that the matrix is already in row echelon form and row reduction produces it unchanged with zero swaps is consistent with this being the input.
