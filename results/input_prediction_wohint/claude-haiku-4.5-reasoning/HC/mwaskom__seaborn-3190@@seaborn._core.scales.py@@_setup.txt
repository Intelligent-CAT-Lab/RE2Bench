[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_setup` method execution to understand what inputs would produce the given output:

1. **Initial state analysis**: The method starts with `new = copy(self)`, so the output represents the state of a copied ContinuousBase object after `_setup` completes.

2. **Key code paths**:
   - `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()` - The output shows `_tick_params` as a dict with all None values (not None itself), indicating that `tick()` was called and returned an initialized dict structure
   - `if new._label_params is None: new = new.label()` - Similarly, `_label_params` is initialized to a dict, indicating it was None before
   - `if prop.normed:` - The output shows `_legend: null`, which means this condition was False (since `_legend` is only set inside this block)
   - `if prop.legend:` - Since `_legend` is null in output, `prop.legend` must be False

3. **Determining input `self`**: Before `_setup` is called, fields like `_tick_params` and `_label_params` must be None (to trigger the `tick()` and `label()` calls)

4. **Determining input `prop`**:
   - `prop.normed` must be False (else branch taken)
   - `prop.legend` must be False (no legend is set)

5. **Determining input `data`**: A pandas Series is needed. The `trans: "log"` suggests log-scale appropriate values (positive numbers)

6. **Determining input `axis`**: The code creates `PseudoAxis` when axis is None, so `axis` should be None

7. **JSON serialization note**: Fields like `_pipeline` (should be a list of functions) and `_spacer` (should be a function) are shown as null/empty in JSON because functions cannot be serialized - this is expected.
