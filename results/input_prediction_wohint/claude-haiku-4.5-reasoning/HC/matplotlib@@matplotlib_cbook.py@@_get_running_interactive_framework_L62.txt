[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `_get_running_interactive_framework()` to understand what conditions would result in the output "headless".

The function checks various interactive frameworks in order:
1. Qt frameworks (PyQt6, PySide6, PyQt5, PySide2) - returns 'qt' if one is loaded and has a running QApplication
2. Gtk - returns 'gtk4' or 'gtk3' based on version and event state
3. wx - returns 'wx' if wx.GetApp() is truthy
4. tkinter - returns 'tk' if mainloop is running
5. macosx - returns 'macosx' if event loop is running
6. If display is not valid - returns 'headless'
7. Otherwise returns None

Since the output is "headless", the function must have reached the line:
```python
if not _c_internal_utils.display_is_valid():
    return 'headless'
```

This means `_c_internal_utils.display_is_valid()` returned False, and all the previous framework checks either:
- Found the modules not loaded (get() returned None), OR
- Found the modules loaded but without active instances/event loops (conditions were False)

Since this function takes NO parameters (the function signature is `def _get_running_interactive_framework():`), the input would be empty. The function only depends on global state (sys.modules and the display validity check).

For "headless" to be returned:
- sys.modules doesn't have these frameworks or they're not in running state
- Most critically: `_c_internal_utils.display_is_valid()` returns False
