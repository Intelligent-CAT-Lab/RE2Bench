[THOUGHT]
1. The `get_weight` method is very simple - it just returns `self._weight`:
   ```python
   def get_weight(self):
       return self._weight
   ```

2. Given the output is `"normal"`, this means `self._weight` must equal `"normal"` at the time the method is called.

3. Looking at the code, `_weight` is set by the `set_weight` method. For `_weight` to be "normal", the weight parameter must be a valid key in `weight_dict` (or a valid integer 0-1000). "normal" is a standard weight value that would be in `weight_dict`.

4. To create a FontProperties object with `_weight = "normal"`, we could either:
   - Initialize with `FontProperties(weight="normal")`, or
   - Call `set_weight("normal")` on an existing object

5. The minimal state needed for `get_weight()` to return "normal" is simply having `_weight` attribute set to "normal".

6. Following the pattern from the example, the input representation should show the state of the `self` object:
