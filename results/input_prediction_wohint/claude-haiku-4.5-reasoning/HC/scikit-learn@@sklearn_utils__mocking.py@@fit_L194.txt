[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze what the output tells us about the inputs to the `fit` method.

The output shows: `"CheckingClassifier(expected_sample_weight=True)"`

This is the string representation (repr) of a `CheckingClassifier` object. The `fit` method returns `self` (line: `return self`), so the output is showing the fitted classifier instance.

The key constraint is that `expected_sample_weight=True`. Looking at the `fit` method logic:

```python
if self.expected_sample_weight:
    if sample_weight is None:
        raise AssertionError('Expected sample_weight to be passed')
    _check_sample_weight(sample_weight, X)
```

Since `expected_sample_weight=True`, the `sample_weight` parameter MUST be provided (not None), otherwise an AssertionError would be raised.

Other requirements for successful execution:
1. `X` and `y` must have the same number of samples (line: `assert _num_samples(X) == _num_samples(y)`)
2. `X` must be 2D so we can get `np.shape(X)[1]` (number of features)
3. `y` must work with `np.unique(check_array(y, ...))`
4. `sample_weight` must have the same length as the number of samples

The repr shows only non-default attributes. Since `expected_sample_weight=True` is the only non-default parameter (all others are None or 'all' or 0), this matches the output.

Let me construct minimal valid inputs:
- `self`: CheckingClassifier instance with `expected_sample_weight=True` and all other parameters at their defaults
- `X`: A 2D array with 2 samples and 2 features
- `y`: A 1D array with 2 labels
- `sample_weight`: A 1D array with 2 weights
- `fit_params`: Empty (no required fit parameters)
