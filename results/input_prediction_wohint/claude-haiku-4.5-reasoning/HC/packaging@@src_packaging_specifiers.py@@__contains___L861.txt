Let me trace through the `__contains__` method to understand what input would produce `true`.

The `__contains__` method simply delegates to `self.contains(item)`:
```python
def __contains__(self, item: UnparsedVersion) -> bool:
    return self.contains(item)
```

Now let's trace `contains()`:
1. `version = _coerce_version(item)` must not be None (item must be a valid version)
2. The method returns `bool(list(self.filter([version], prereleases=prereleases)))`
3. For this to return `True`, the filter must return a non-empty iterator

For the simplest case, I'll use an empty SpecifierSet (no version constraints):
- With `_specs = []` and `_prereleases = None`
- Call with `item = "1.0.0"` (a valid non-prerelease version)

Tracing through `filter()` with empty specs:
1. `if prereleases is None and self.prereleases is not None:` → False (self.prereleases is None for empty SpecifierSet)
2. `if self._specs:` → False (specs is empty, goes to else)
3. In the else block:
   - `if prereleases is True:` → False
   - `if prereleases is False:` → False
   - Falls through to manual filtering
4. For Version("1.0.0"):
   - Not a prerelease, so it's added to `filtered` list
   - Returns `iter(filtered)` which is non-empty
5. Back in `contains()`: `bool(list(non-empty iterator))` = `True`

This produces the output `true`.
