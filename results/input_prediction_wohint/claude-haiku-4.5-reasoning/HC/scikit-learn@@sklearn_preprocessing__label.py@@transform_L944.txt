[THOUGHT]
To find the input `y` for the `transform` method, I need to work backwards from the output matrix.

The output is a 25×3 binary matrix where each row represents a sample and each column represents a class. A 1 in position [i, j] means sample i has class j as one of its labels.

Let me decode each row to determine what the input labels were for each sample:
- Row 0: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 1: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 2: [1, 1, 1] → class indices 0, 1, 2
- Row 3: [1, 1, 1] → class indices 0, 1, 2
- Row 4: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 5: [1, 1, 0] → class indices 0, 1
- Row 6: [0, 0, 0] → no classes (empty set)
- Row 7: [1, 0, 0] → class index 0
- Row 8: [0, 0, 1] → class index 2
- Row 9: [0, 0, 0] → no classes
- Row 10: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 11: [0, 0, 0] → no classes
- Row 12: [0, 1, 1] → class indices 1, 2
- Row 13: [1, 0, 0] → class index 0
- Row 14: [1, 1, 0] → class indices 0, 1
- Row 15: [1, 1, 1] → class indices 0, 1, 2
- Row 16: [0, 0, 0] → no classes
- Row 17: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 18: [0, 0, 0] → no classes
- Row 19: [1, 1, 1] → class indices 0, 1, 2
- Row 20: [0, 1, 1] → class indices 1, 2
- Row 21: [0, 0, 1] → class index 2
- Row 22: [1, 0, 1] → class indices 0, 2
- Row 23: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1
- Row 24: [0, 1, 0] → class index 1

The output is a dense array (not sparse), so `sparse_output` must be `False`.

Since the matrix has 3 columns, there are 3 classes. The input has the classes as [0, 1, 2] based on the indices used.

The estimator must be fitted, which means it needs `classes_` attribute set. The `_cached_dict` is initially None and gets built during the first call to `_build_cache()`.
