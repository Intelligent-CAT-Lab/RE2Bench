[THOUGHT]

Looking at the output, I need to reverse-engineer the inputs X and y that were passed to the `fit` method, given the state of the BayesianRidge object after fitting.

Key observations from the output:
1. `X_offset_`: [2.88235294, 4.11764706] - these are the means of X's columns
2. `X_scale_`: [1., 1.] - no scaling since normalize=False
3. The data has 2 features (X is 2D with shape (n_samples, 2))
4. `n_iter_`: 13 - algorithm converged after 13 iterations
5. `coef_`: [0.00147976, 0.00186202] - very small coefficients
6. `intercept_`: 2.576302957347
7. `scores_` has 14 values (14 iterations recorded)

To reconstruct X:
- For mean [2.88235294, 4.11764706] with integer values, I estimate approximately 17 samples
- 2.88235294 ≈ 49/17, so first column should sum to ~49
- 4.11764706 ≈ 70/17, so second column should sum to ~70

Constructing X to match these means:
- First column sum: 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36, need 13 more
- Second column sum: 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36, need 34 more

To reconstruct y:
- The intercept (~2.576) and very small coefficients suggest y values cluster around 2.5-2.6
- With fit_intercept=True and normalize=False, y_offset (mean of y) should produce this intercept
- y values should average around 2.58 (accounting for X contribution to intercept)

The initialization parameters shown in the output (n_iter=300, tol=0.001, etc., compute_score=true) represent the BayesianRidge instance configuration.
