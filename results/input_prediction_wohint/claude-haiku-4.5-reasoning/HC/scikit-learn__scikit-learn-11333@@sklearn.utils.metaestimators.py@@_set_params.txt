Looking at the `_set_params` method and the provided OUTPUT, I need to trace through what parameters would be passed to produce this final state.

The signature is: `def _set_params(self, attr, **params)`

From the code context and how `ColumnTransformer.get_params` calls `_get_params('_transformers', ...)`, we can infer that `ColumnTransformer.set_params` would similarly call `_set_params('_transformers', **params)`.

The method logic:
1. If `attr` ('_transformers') is in params, it would be popped and set directly
2. The remaining params (that don't match estimator names) are passed to parent's `set_params` via `super(_BaseComposition, self).set_params(**params)`
3. The parent's `set_params` sets regular constructor parameters like `remainder`, `n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`

The OUTPUT shows the final attribute values after `_set_params` completes:
- `transformers`: null
- `remainder`: "drop"
- `n_jobs`: 1
- `transformer_weights`: null

This means `_set_params` was called with these parameters to set them.

For the `self` object before calling `_set_params`, it would need to be a ColumnTransformer instance with some initial state (possibly with None or empty values that are then updated).

The `attr` parameter would be `'_transformers'` since that's the convention for ColumnTransformer.

The `**params` passed would include all the parameters that need to be set to achieve the OUTPUT state.
