[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_mask_nc` function to understand what input would produce the given output.

The output format shows:
```
[
    "sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1",
    {},
    null
]
```

This represents a tuple with 3 elements:
1. String representation of an expression: `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1`
2. Empty dictionary: `{}`
3. Empty collection or `None`: `null`

Looking at the function logic:

**Case 1 - Early return (when expression is commutative):**
```python
if expr.is_commutative:
    return (eq, {}, [])
```

For the expression `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1`:
- This is composed of Add, sin (continuous function), Sum, and symbols - all commutative
- So `expr.is_commutative` would be `True`
- The function would return `(eq, {}, [])` where:
  - First element: the original expression
  - Second element: empty dict `{}`
  - Third element: empty list `[]` (represented as `null` in JSON)

This matches the output pattern!

The input expression should be: `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1`

The `name` parameter defaults to `None` (or `'mask'` if not provided), which doesn't affect the output in this case since we return early.

So the input would be:
- `eq`: a sympy expression representing `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1`
- `name`: `None` (optional, defaults in the function)
