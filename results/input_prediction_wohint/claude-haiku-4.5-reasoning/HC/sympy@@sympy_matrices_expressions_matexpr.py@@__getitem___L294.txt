[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__getitem__` method to understand what input would produce the output "X[1, 2]".

The output "X[1, 2]" is a string representation of what the method returns. This looks like a MatrixElement object's string representation.

Following the code execution:

1. When `__getitem__` is called with key `(1, 2)`:
   - `isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2` → True
   - Neither element is a slice, so it proceeds to the main branch
   
2. The indices are sympathified:
   - `i, j = (_sympify(1), _sympify(2))` → Creates Integer objects

3. `valid_index(i, j)` validation:
   - After sympathification, i and j are Integer objects
   - For indices (1, 2) to be valid, we need:
     - `1 < self.rows` (rows must be > 1)
     - `2 < self.cols` (cols must be > 2)
   - A 3×3 shape satisfies this: both 1 and 2 are valid indices

4. The method calls `self._entry(i, j)`:
   - The base implementation in MatrixExpr returns `MatrixElement(self, i, j)`

5. When MatrixElement(self, 1, 2) is converted to string via `__str__()`:
   - It produces "X[1, 2]" where X is the name/representation of the matrix

This means:
- `self` must be a MatrixExpr (likely MatrixSymbol) with name "X"
- `key` must be the tuple (1, 2)

For the self object to print as "X", it needs to be a MatrixSymbol named "X" with an appropriate shape (at least 2×3 to make both indices valid). A 3×3 shape will work perfectly.
