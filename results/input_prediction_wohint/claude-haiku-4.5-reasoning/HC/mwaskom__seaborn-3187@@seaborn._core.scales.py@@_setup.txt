Let me trace through the `_setup` function to determine what inputs would produce the given output state.

**Analyzing the output state:**
- `trans`: "log" - indicates a log scale type
- `norm`: null - no normalization bounds set
- `_tick_params`: non-null dict with structure - these are set by calling `new.tick()`
- `_label_params`: non-null dict with structure - these are set by calling `new.label()`
- `_matplotlib_scale`: has a _transform object - set by `_get_scale()`
- `_pipeline`: will be populated by the pipeline logic
- `_spacer`: represents the spacer function
- `_legend`: null - indicates that `prop.legend` must be False (otherwise this would be populated)

**Key deductions:**

1. **Initial self state**: Since code checks `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()` and the output shows these as non-null dicts, they must have been initially None and then set by those methods.

2. **data parameter**: Must be a pandas Series suitable for log scale:
   - Needs numeric, positive values (since log requires positive numbers)
   - Needs a name attribute (used as `str(data.name)`)

3. **prop parameter**: From the code execution:
   - `prop.normed` → determines normalization path
   - `prop.legend` → must be False (since `_legend` is null in output)
   - `prop.get_mapping()` → returns part of the pipeline

4. **axis parameter**: Defaults to None, triggering PseudoAxis creation

5. **Initial state of self**: Should have the basic structure with None values for attributes that get filled in during `_setup`

The output showing `_legend: null` is the key indicator that `prop.legend` is False (the legend block was not executed).
