[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `match_submerged_margins` function to understand what input would produce an output of two Axes objects.

The function:
1. Initializes `axsdone = []`
2. Recursively processes subfigures and accumulates results
3. Filters `fig.get_axes()` to get axes that:
   - Have a subplotspec (not None)
   - Are in layout (`get_in_layout()` returns True)
   - Are not in `axsdone`
4. Processes each axis, potentially removing those whose gridspec is not in `layoutgrids`
5. Returns the final list of axes

For the output to be a list of 2 Axes, I need:
- `fig` with 2 axes that pass all the filters
- Both axes must have subplotspecs
- Both axes must be in layout
- Both axes' subplotspecs' gridspecs must be keys in `layoutgrids`
- `fig.subfigs` should be empty (so `axsdone` stays empty)
- The axes should not be removed (gridspecs are in layoutgrids)
- Axes should have colspan and rowspan with length 1 to avoid margin processing complications

To represent matplotlib objects in JSON:
- `layoutgrids` maps gridspec identifiers to layout grid objects with `margin_vals`
- `fig` contains `subfigs` list and `axes` list
- Each axis has a `subplotspec` with `gridspec` reference, `colspan`, `rowspan`, and `in_layout` flag

A minimal valid input would have:
- One gridspec in layoutgrids
- Two axes in the figure, both referencing that gridspec
- Simple spans to avoid complex margin calculations
