[THOUGHT]

Looking at the function `_construct_simple(coeffs, opt)`, I need to understand what return value would produce the output `[{}, null]` (which is a Python tuple `(domain_object, None)` serialized to JSON as a list).

The function has these return patterns:
1. Early returns: `return False` or `return None`
2. Normal return: `return (domain, result)` where `result` is typically a list

Analyzing the output `[{}, null]`:
- This represents a tuple `(domain_object, None)` 
- The `{}` represents a serialized Domain object
- The `null` represents `None` in Python

For the function to return a tuple with `None` as the second element:
- The `algebraics` branch must be taken (when `opt.extension is True` and at least one algebraic coefficient exists)
- The `_construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt)` function must return `(domain, None)`

However, the simplest case would be with an empty coefficient list:
- `coeffs = []` triggers no iterations
- All flags remain `False` (`algebraics = False`)
- Goes to the else branch
- With default options and empty coefficients: `domain = ZZ`, `result = []`
- Returns `(ZZ, [])`

Given the specific output format `[{}, null]` and without the `_construct_algebraic` implementation visible, the most likely scenario is:
- Empty or minimal coefficient list
- Basic options object without special extensions enabled
