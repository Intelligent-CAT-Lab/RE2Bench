[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `restify` function to find what input produces the output `:py:obj:`None``.

Looking at the function flow:
1. The function takes one parameter: `cls` (typed as `Optional[Type]`)
2. It enters a try block and checks various conditions in sequence
3. The first condition is: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType: return ':py:obj:`None`'`

The output `:py:obj:`None`` is exactly what gets returned when the first condition is satisfied.

To satisfy `cls is None or cls is NoneType`:
- Either `cls` must be the `None` object itself
- Or `cls` must be `NoneType` (which is `type(None)`)

The most direct and typical input would be when `cls` is `None` itself (the None object), which in JSON is represented as `null`.

When `cls = None`:
- The condition `cls is None` evaluates to `True`
- The function returns `':py:obj:`None`'` immediately
- This matches the expected output exactly
