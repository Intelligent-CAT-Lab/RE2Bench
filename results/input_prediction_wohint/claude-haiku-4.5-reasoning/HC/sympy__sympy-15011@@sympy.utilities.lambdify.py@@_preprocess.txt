[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `_preprocess` method, I need to determine what inputs would produce the output `[null, "sin(x)**2"]`, which represents a tuple `(argstrs, expr)`.

Let me trace the execution:

1. The function initializes `argstrs = []`
2. It accesses `self._dummify` attribute
3. If `not dummify`, it checks for Dummy instances in `args`
4. It iterates over `args` with a for loop - each iteration appends something to `argstrs`
5. Returns `(argstrs, expr)`

For the output to be `([], "sin(x)**2")` where:
- `argstrs = []` (represented as `null` in JSON)
- `expr = "sin(x)**2"` (a string)

Analysis:
- Since `argstrs` must remain an empty list, the `for arg in args:` loop must not execute
- This means `args` must be an empty list/sequence: `args = []`
- Since `expr` is returned unchanged (no substitutions occur), it must be the input: `expr = "sin(x)**2"`
- The `self` object needs the `_dummify` attribute, which can be `False`

When `args` is empty:
- The for loop doesn't execute
- `argstrs` stays as `[]`
- `expr` is returned unchanged
- Result: `([], "sin(x)**2")`
