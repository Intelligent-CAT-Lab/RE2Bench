To determine the input (m, n) to `multinomial_coefficients`, I need to analyze the output structure.

**Observing the output:**
1. All keys are tuples of length 4, e.g., (2, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), etc. This tells me m = 4
2. All tuples sum to 2:
   - 2+0+0+0 = 2
   - 1+1+0+0 = 2
   - 0+2+0+0 = 2
   - ... and so on
   
   This tells me n = 2

**Verifying with multinomial coefficient formula:**
The multinomial coefficient for a tuple (a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ) is: n! / (a₁! × a₂! × ... × aₘ!)

Let me verify a few values:
- (2,0,0,0): 2!/(2!×0!×0!×0!) = 2/2 = 1 ✓
- (1,1,0,0): 2!/(1!×1!×0!×0!) = 2/1 = 2 ✓
- (0,2,0,0): 2!/(0!×2!×0!×0!) = 2/2 = 1 ✓
- (1,0,1,0): 2!/(1!×0!×1!×0!) = 2/1 = 2 ✓
- (0,0,0,2): 2!/(0!×0!×0!×2!) = 2/2 = 1 ✓

All coefficients match the expected multinomial formula for m=4, n=2.

**Tracing execution:**
Since m=4, n=2: the condition `if m >= 2*n and n > 1` checks if 4 >= 4 and 2 > 1, which is True. So the function returns `dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2))`, which generates exactly these tuples and their coefficients.
