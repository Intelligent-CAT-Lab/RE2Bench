[THOUGHT]
Looking at this `build_digest_header` function, I need to work backwards from the output to determine what inputs would produce it.

The output is a digest authentication header string containing:
- `username="user"` 
- `realm="me@kennethreitz.com"`
- `nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"`
- `uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"` (this is the request path)
- `algorithm="MD5"`
- `opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"`
- `qop="auth"`
- `nc=00000001` (nonce count)
- `cnonce="53e3a9c0a7352f78"` (client nonce)
- `response="d4094e09aabba1d50d126a165bd3e460"` (response hash)

**For the `self` object (HTTPDigestAuth instance):**
- `username = "user"` (appears in output)
- `password = "pass"` (inferred from URI pattern "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass")
- `last_nonce = ""` (empty string, indicating this is the first use of this nonce)
- `nonce_count = 0` (initial value; in the function it's set/incremented based on nonce comparison)
- `chal` dictionary populated with: realm, nonce, algorithm, opaque, qop (all visible in output)
- `pos = null` (not used in this function)

**For the ncvalue:**
The code does: `ncvalue = '%08x' % self.nonce_count`
Since `nc=00000001` (which is 1 in hex), the nonce_count becomes 1 after the comparison check.

**For the `method` parameter:**
The URI suggests a resource endpoint for digest auth test. HTTP GET is the most common method for such requests.

**For the `url` parameter:**
Must have path `/digest-auth/auth/user/pass` based on the `uri` in the output. Can be any full URL with this path.

Note: The `cnonce` is generated using non-deterministic values (time.ctime() and os.urandom(8)), so it cannot be predicted exactly - but it's shown in the output as an expected value that was generated at runtime.
