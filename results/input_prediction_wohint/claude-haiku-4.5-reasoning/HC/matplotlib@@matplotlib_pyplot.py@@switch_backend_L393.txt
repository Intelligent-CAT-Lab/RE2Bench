[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `switch_backend` function:

1. The function signature is `def switch_backend(newbackend: str) -> None:`, which means it returns `None` by design.

2. The output shows `{"output": null}`, which in Python corresponds to `None`. This is expected behavior for this function - all code paths eventually complete without an explicit return statement, thus returning `None`.

3. The function accepts a single parameter `newbackend` of type `str`, which specifies which matplotlib backend to load.

4. Looking at the code, there are several valid backend strings mentioned:
   - 'macosx', 'qtagg', 'gtk4agg', 'gtk3agg', 'tkagg', 'wxagg' (in the candidates list)
   - 'agg' (mentioned as the final fallback)
   - 'ipympl', 'widget' (special case handling)

5. The safest backend that will work without raising exceptions is `'agg'` since:
   - It's explicitly mentioned as a fallback: `switch_backend('agg')`
   - It's a built-in backend that doesn't have external dependencies
   - The code structure shows it's expected to always succeed

6. Following the input format from the example, where function parameters are shown in an `args` field as a dictionary:
