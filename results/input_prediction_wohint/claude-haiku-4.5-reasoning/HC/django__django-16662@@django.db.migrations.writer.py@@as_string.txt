[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `as_string` method to determine what input would produce the given output.

The output is:
```
from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
    ]
```

The method populates an `items` dictionary and uses `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` to format it. Let me work backwards from the output:

1. **migration_header**: Since the output has no header timestamp comment, `self.include_header` must be `False`, making `items['migration_header'] = ''`

2. **imports**: The output shows `from django.db import migrations\n` which comes from the default import added when no models import is present. This happens when `self.migration.operations` is empty (no operations added → no imports added).

3. **operations**: The output shows empty operations list `\n    ]\n`, meaning `items['operations'] = ''`. This requires `self.migration.operations` to be an empty list.

4. **dependencies**: The output shows empty dependencies list `\n    ]\n`, meaning `items['dependencies'] = ''`. This requires `self.migration.dependencies` to be an empty list.

5. **replaces_str**: No replaces shown, so `self.migration.replaces` must be falsy (None/empty).

6. **initial_str**: No initial marker shown, so `self.migration.initial` must be `False`.

Tracing through the code flow:
- Loop through empty `self.migration.operations` → nothing added
- Loop through empty `self.migration.dependencies` → nothing added
- No imports from operations → default 'from django.db import migrations' gets added
- With `include_header=False` → migration_header is empty
- With `replaces=None` → replaces_str is empty
- With `initial=False` → initial_str is empty

This produces the exact output shown.
