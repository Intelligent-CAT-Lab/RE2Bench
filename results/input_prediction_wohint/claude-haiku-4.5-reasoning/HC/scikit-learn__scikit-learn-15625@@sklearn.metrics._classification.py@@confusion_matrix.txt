Let me trace through the `confusion_matrix` function to work backwards from the output.

The output `"[[ 9  0]\n [ 0 11]]"` represents a 2×2 confusion matrix:
```
[[9, 0],
 [0, 11]]
```

This is a binary classification confusion matrix where:
- Position [0,0] = 9 (true negatives - class 0 predicted correctly)
- Position [0,1] = 0 (false positives - class 0 ground truth, class 1 predicted)
- Position [1,0] = 0 (false negatives - class 1 ground truth, class 0 predicted)
- Position [1,1] = 11 (true positives - class 1 predicted correctly)

Working backwards through the function:

1. The confusion matrix is constructed from: `coo_matrix((sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred)), shape=(n_labels, n_labels))` where n_labels = 2

2. For a 2×2 matrix, we need exactly 2 unique labels. The default behavior when `labels=None` is to compute `unique_labels(y_true, y_pred)` which would give us [0, 1].

3. The `label_to_ind` mapping would be {0: 0, 1: 1}, providing direct row/column indices.

4. To produce the output matrix:
   - We need 9 samples where both y_true and y_pred equal 0 (contributes to [0,0])
   - We need 11 samples where both y_true and y_pred equal 1 (contributes to [1,1])
   - We need 0 misclassified samples (contributes to [0,1] and [1,0])

5. When `sample_weight=None`, the function defaults to `np.ones(n_samples, dtype=np.int64)`, so each sample contributes weight 1.

6. The simplest input satisfying these requirements:
   - y_true: 9 zeros followed by 11 ones
   - y_pred: 9 zeros followed by 11 ones
   - labels, sample_weight, normalize: all use defaults (None)

Verification:
- _check_targets will identify both as 'binary' type
- unique_labels(y_true, y_pred) returns [0, 1]
- No misclassifications, so the matrix is diagonal with 9 and 11 on the diagonal
- Result: [[9, 0], [0, 11]] ✓
