[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `simple_tag` method to understand what input would produce an empty output `{}`.

The `simple_tag` method signature is:
```python
def simple_tag(self, func=None, takes_context=None, name=None):
```

The logic flow is:
1. If `func is None`: returns the `dec` function (decorator factory)
2. If `func` is callable: calls `dec(func)` and returns the original function `func`
3. Otherwise: raises ValueError

The output `{}` (empty JSON object) suggests either:
- The method returns with no meaningful output (a function, which can't be serialized to JSON)
- The Library instance has empty state (filters and tags dicts are both empty)

Since `simple_tag` is called with default/no arguments (func=None, takes_context=None, name=None), it would:
- Return the `dec` function (the decorator factory)
- The Library instance remains unchanged with empty filters and tags dicts
- The `{}` output represents this empty state

The most straightforward case is calling `simple_tag()` with ALL default arguments on a fresh Library instance that has empty filters and tags.
