[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution:

1. The function `get_family()` is defined as:
```python
def get_family(self):
    return self._family
```

2. This function simply returns the `_family` attribute of the `self` object.

3. The output shows: `{"output": ["Helvetica"]}`

4. This means `self._family` must equal `["Helvetica"]` for the function to return this value.

5. Looking at the class, `_family` is an attribute set during object initialization through the `set_family()` method, which converts string input to a list:
```python
def set_family(self, family):
    family = mpl._val_or_rc(family, 'font.family')
    if isinstance(family, str):
        family = [family]
    self._family = family
```

6. For the output to be `["Helvetica"]`, the input object must have the `_family` attribute set to `["Helvetica"]`.

7. This would happen if a FontProperties object was initialized with `family="Helvetica"` (or as a list `["Helvetica"]`), causing `set_family()` to set `self._family = ["Helvetica"]`.
