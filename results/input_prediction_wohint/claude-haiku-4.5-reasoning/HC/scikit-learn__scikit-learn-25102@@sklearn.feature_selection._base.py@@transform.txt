[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `transform` method with the given output `[[0 1]]`.

The `transform` method:
1. Gets output configuration
2. Validates the input X using `_validate_data()`
3. Returns `_transform(X)`

The `_transform` method:
1. Gets a support mask from `self.get_support()`
2. If the mask is empty, raises a warning and returns an empty array
3. Otherwise, returns `_safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1)` - selecting columns from X based on the mask

The output `[[0 1]]` is a 2D numpy array with:
- Shape: (1, 2) - 1 sample, 2 features
- Values: [0, 1]

For `_safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1)` to produce `[[0 1]]`:
1. The input X must have 1 row and at least 2 columns
2. The mask must select columns such that we get values [0, 1]
3. The simplest case is X = `[[0, 1]]` with all columns selected (mask = [True, True])

The selector's state must allow `get_support()` to return a mask that selects both features:
- Must be fitted (have `n_features_in_` attribute set)
- Must indicate that both features are selected (from `_get_support_mask()`)

For the minimal input that produces this output:
- X is a 1x2 array with values [[0, 1]]
- The selector has been fitted on 2 features
- Both features are marked as important/selected
