[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `deprecated` function:

1. The `deprecated` function is a decorator factory that takes parameters: `since` (positional), and several keyword-only parameters with defaults (`message`, `name`, `alternative`, `pending`, `obj_type`, `addendum`, `removal`).

2. When `deprecated` is called, it:
   - Accepts the arguments
   - Defines an inner function called `deprecate`
   - Returns the `deprecate` function

3. The output shows: `<function deprecated.<locals>.deprecate at 0x71b9746905e0>`
   - This is the string representation of the `deprecate` function object
   - This is what gets returned when `deprecated(...)` is called

4. To produce this output, we need to call `deprecate` with at least the required `since` parameter. The other parameters have defaults, so they don't need to be explicitly provided.

5. A reasonable value for `since` (the version when the deprecation was introduced) would be a version string like "3.0".

6. The minimal input would be: `deprecated("3.0")`
   - This causes the function to create and return the `deprecate` function
   - Which matches the output shown

Following the JSON format from the example, where arguments are shown as dictionaries in the `args` field:
