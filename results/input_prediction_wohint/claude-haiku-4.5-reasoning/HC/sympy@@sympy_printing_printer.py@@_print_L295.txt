Looking at the output "phi", I need to trace through the `_print` method to determine what expression would produce this output.

The `_print` method works by:
1. Taking an expression object
2. Looking up methods in the form `_print_<ClassName>`
3. Calling the appropriate printer method

The output "phi" suggests this is a Simple string output, most likely from printing a Symbol with the name "phi".

Looking at `sympy.sympy.printing.str._print_Symbol`:
```python
def _print_Symbol(self, expr):
    return expr.name
```

This directly returns the symbol's name. So if the output is "phi", and this is the StrPrinter, then a Symbol with `name="phi"` was printed.

Additionally, looking at `sympy.sympy.printing.pretty.pretty._print_Symbol`:
```python
def _print_Symbol(self, e, bold_name=False):
    symb = pretty_symbol(e.name, bold_name)
    return prettyForm(symb)
```

And `pretty_symbol('phi')` would also return "phi" when the output is just the symbol name.

So the input to `_print` would be a Symbol object with the name "phi".
