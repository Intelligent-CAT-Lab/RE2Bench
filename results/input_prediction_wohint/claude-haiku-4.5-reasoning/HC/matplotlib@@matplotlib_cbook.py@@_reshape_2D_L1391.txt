[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution with the given output:

The output shows:
```
[
    "array([0.97291764, 0.78306588, 0.33642111, 0.38893703, 0.74362113])",
    "array([0.11094361, 0.97289726, 0.56741904, 0.90630365, 0.63297416])",
    "array([0.38826409, 0.48320961, 0.04794151, 0.16101821, 0.32418002])"
]
```

This is a list of 3 numpy arrays, each with 5 elements.

Let me trace the function logic:

1. `X = _unpack_to_numpy(X)` - converts input to numpy if needed
2. If X is a numpy array, it gets transposed: `X = X.transpose()`
3. Then the code returns: `[np.reshape(x, -1) for x in X]`

This list comprehension iterates over rows of the (potentially transposed) array.

To get 3 arrays of 5 elements each, after transpose X must have shape (3, 5).

Therefore, the original X (before transpose) must have shape (5, 3).

The values in the output represent the rows after transpose:
- Row 0 after transpose: [0.97291764, 0.78306588, 0.33642111, 0.38893703, 0.74362113] (which are column 0 values before transpose)
- Row 1 after transpose: [0.11094361, 0.97289726, 0.56741904, 0.90630365, 0.63297416] (which are column 1 values before transpose)  
- Row 2 after transpose: [0.38826409, 0.48320961, 0.04794151, 0.16101821, 0.32418002] (which are column 2 values before transpose)

So before transpose, the array must be:
```
[[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409],
 [0.78306588, 0.97289726, 0.48320961],
 [0.33642111, 0.56741904, 0.04794151],
 [0.38893703, 0.90630365, 0.16101821],
 [0.74362113, 0.63297416, 0.32418002]]
```

The `name` parameter is only used in error messages, so any string value works, e.g., "X" or "data".

Note: The input X must be a numpy array (not a list of lists) because the function explicitly checks `isinstance(X, np.ndarray)` before transposing. A list of lists would not be transposed and would follow the else branch, producing incorrect output.

[INPUT]
```json
{
    "X": [
        [0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409],
        [0.78306588, 0.97289726, 0.48320961],
        [0.33642111, 0.56741904, 0.04794151],
        [0.38893703, 0.90630365, 0.16101821],
        [0.74362113, 0.63297416, 0.32418002]
    ],
    "name": "X"
}
```

Note: X should be passed as a numpy array with shape (5, 3) and dtype float64.
