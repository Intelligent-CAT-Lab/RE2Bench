[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` to understand what inputs produce the given output.

The function returns:
```python
return (polys, opt)
```

Where:
- `polys` is a list of two Poly objects: `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')` and `Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`
- `opt` has `gens=['cos(phi)']`, `domain='ZZ'`, `polys=False`

The function has two main paths:

**Early exit path** (if both inputs are already Poly objects):
```python
if len(exprs) == 2:
    f, g = exprs
    if isinstance(f, Poly) and isinstance(g, Poly):
        # ... unifies and returns early
        if opt.polys is None:
            opt.polys = True  # <-- Would set to True if None
        return ([f, g], opt)
```

The output shows `opt.polys = False`, not `True`. So if this path were taken with `opt.polys = None`, it would become `True`, which contradicts the output.

**Regular path** (expressions are converted to Polys):
The function continues beyond line checking if both inputs are Poly instances. Then:
- Expressions are sympified
- `_parallel_dict_from_expr` converts them to dict representations  
- Poly objects are constructed from these dicts
- At the end: `if opt.polys is None: opt.polys = bool(_polys)`

If the inputs are expressions (not Poly objects):
- `_polys` would be empty (neither expression has `.is_Poly == True`)
- `bool([]) = False`
- So `opt.polys` becomes `False` ✓ (matches output)

For the expressions to produce the output Polys `Poly(2, ...)` and `Poly(-2*cos(phi), ...)`, the inputs should be:
- First expression: `2` 
- Second expression: `-2*cos(phi)`

With generators already specified as `cos(phi)` in the opt object.

The `opt` object parameters needed:
- `gens`: Must be `["cos(phi)"]` so the function constructs Polys with this generator
- `domain`: Must be `"ZZ"` (integers domain)
- `polys`: Should be `None` so it gets set to `False` by the logic above
- `expand`: Typically `False` for this scenario
