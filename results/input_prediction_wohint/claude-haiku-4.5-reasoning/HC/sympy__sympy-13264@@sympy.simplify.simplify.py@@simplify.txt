[THOUGHT]

Let me analyze what input to `simplify()` would produce the output `"n + n**(-n)"`.

Looking at the function signature:
```python
def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, rational=False):
```

The function takes an expression and applies various simplification strategies. The output is a string representation of a SymPy expression: `"n + n**(-n)"`.

To work backwards from the output:
1. The output `"n + n**(-n)"` is a relatively simple expression with a variable `n`, an addition operation, and a power operation with negative exponent.

2. This output could come from:
   - The input being the same expression: `"n + n**(-n)"`
   - An equivalent form like: `"n + 1/n**n"` (since `1/n**n` equals `n**(-n)`)
   - A more complex expression that simplifies to this form, such as: `"(n**2 + n**(1-n))/n"` which would simplify: `(n**2 + n**(1-n))/n = n + n**(1-n-1) = n + n**(-n)`

3. Since `simplify()` is designed to take complex expressions and reduce them, and considering the law that if the simplified result is too much more complex than the original (measured by `count_ops`), it returns the original - the most likely input is either:
   - The expression already in this form: `"n + n**(-n)"`
   - An equivalent rational form like: `"n + 1/n**n"`

The simplest and most direct answer is that the input expression was `"n + n**(-n)"` itself, possibly with default parameter values for `ratio` and `rational`.
