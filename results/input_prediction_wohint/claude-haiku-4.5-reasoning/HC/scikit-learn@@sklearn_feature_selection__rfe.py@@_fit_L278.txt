[THOUGHT]
Looking at the RFE._fit method and the provided output, I need to determine what inputs would produce an RFE object with these parameters after _fit is called.

The output shows: `RFE(estimator=SVC(kernel='linear'), n_features_to_select=4, step=0.1)`

This tells me the RFE object was initialized with:
- estimator = SVC(kernel='linear')
- n_features_to_select = 4
- step = 0.1
- (and default values for verbose=0 and importance_getter='auto')

The _fit method signature is: `def _fit(self, X, y, step_score=None, **fit_params)`

For the method to execute successfully:

1. **X requirements**: 
   - Must be a 2D array with shape (n_samples, n_features)
   - Must have n_features > 4 (to select 4 features from a larger set)
   - Since step=0.1, it will be converted to `int(max(1, 0.1 * n_features))`

2. **y requirements**:
   - Must be compatible with SVC classification
   - For simple binary classification, can be [0, 1, 0, 1, ...]

3. **step_score**: Not provided for basic RFE (only used for RFECV), so None

4. **fit_params**: No additional parameters needed, so empty dict

The algorithm will:
- Calculate step = int(max(1, 0.1 * n_features)) = 1 (if n_features=10)
- Iteratively remove features until exactly 4 remain
- Return the modified self

I'll create a minimal but realistic dataset:
- 6 samples, 10 features (enough to select 4)
- Binary classification target
- Numeric data suitable for SVC fitting
