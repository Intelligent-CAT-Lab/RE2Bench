[THOUGHT]
Let me trace backward from the output to understand what input would produce this result.

The output is: `[1, {"signals.Person": 1}]`

This is the return value from `collector.delete()`. The format is:
- First element: Total count of objects deleted (1)
- Second element: Dictionary mapping `"app_label.ModelName"` to count deleted ("signals.Person": 1)

This tells us:
1. Exactly 1 Person object was deleted
2. The model is from the "signals" app and named "Person"
3. The model label is "signals.Person"

The `delete` method has signature:
```python
def delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):
```

It requires:
1. `self.pk` must not be None (or it raises ValueError)
2. `self._meta` must have `object_name` and `pk.attname` attributes
3. The model label should match "signals.Person"
4. The instance should have `_state` with `db` attribute

For one object to be deleted and returned in a dict as "signals.Person", the instance must:
- Have pk=1 (indicating it exists in DB)
- Have `_state.adding=False` (indicating it was retrieved from DB, not being created)
- Have `_meta.label="signals.Person"` or equivalent (app_label="signals", object_name="Person")

Since no explicit parameters were passed to delete (not evident from output), both `using` and `keep_parents` should be their defaults (None and False).
