[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `_parallel_dict_from_expr_no_gens` backwards from the output to determine the input.

The output shows:
```
{
    "output": [
        [{(1,): "1"}],           # polys - list containing one dict
        ["cos(phi)"]              # tuple(gens) - tuple containing one generator
    ]
}
```

The function returns `(polys, tuple(gens))` where:
- `polys` is a list of polynomial dicts
- `tuple(gens)` is a tuple of generators

From the output, I can deduce:
1. There is exactly one generator: `cos(phi)`
2. There is one polynomial dict with monomial key `(1,)` and coefficient value `1`

Working backwards through the algorithm:

For the monomial `(1,)` with value `1`:
- `k = len(gens) = 1` (only one generator)
- The monomial `(1,)` means exponent 1 for the first (only) generator
- The coefficient value `1` comes from `Mul(*coeff)` where `coeff = []`

For this to happen:
- The input expression must be processed such that after `Add.make_args()` and `Mul.make_args()`, we get `cos(phi)` as a non-coefficient factor
- `cos(phi)` is not a number, so it goes to the `elements` dict
- `decompose_power(cos(phi))` returns `(cos(phi), 1)`
- So `elements[cos(phi)] = 1` and `coeff = []`
- Result: `Mul(*[]) = 1` for the coefficient

The simplest input that produces this is just `cos(phi)` as a single expression:
- `Add.make_args(cos(phi))` → `(cos(phi),)`
- `Mul.make_args(cos(phi))` → `(cos(phi),)`
- This is not a coefficient, so it gets decomposed into base `cos(phi)` with exponent `1`

For the `opt` object, the code checks multiple conditions to define `_is_coeff()`. To get the default behavior where `_is_coeff(factor)` checks `factor.is_number`:
- `opt.domain = None`
- `opt.extension` must not be `True` 
- `opt.greedy` must be `False`
- `opt.series = False` (to use `decompose_power`)
- `opt.wrt = None` and `opt.sort = []` (for `_sort_gens`)

For a single expression with one generator, we need: `exprs = ["cos(phi)"]`
