To find the input to `handle` that produces output `"1/(a - b)"`, I need to trace through the function logic.

The handle function is nested within radsimp and processes an expression `expr`. Let me trace what happens if `expr = 1/(a - b)`:

1. **Initial fraction decomposition**: `n, d = fraction(1/(a - b))` gives `n = 1` and `d = a - b`

2. **First condition check** - `if expr.is_Atom or (d.is_Atom and n.is_Atom):`
   - `1/(a - b)` is not an atom
   - `d = a - b` is not atomic (it's an Add)
   - Condition is False, continue

3. **Second condition** - `elif not n.is_Atom:` where `n = 1` (atomic)
   - This is False, continue

4. **Third condition** - `elif n is not S.One:` where `n = S.One`
   - This is False, continue

5. **Fourth condition** - `elif d.is_Mul:` where `d = a - b` (it's an Add, not Mul)
   - This is False, continue

6. The function continues and enters the main while loop analyzing the denominator `a - b`

7. **In the while loop**: For `d = a - b`, the loop analyzes the terms and finds that there are no radicals (nrad = 0), so it breaks out immediately

8. **Final return**: `return _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d)` returns `_unevaluated_Mul(1, 1/(a - b))` which equals `1/(a - b)`

This matches the expected output perfectly.
