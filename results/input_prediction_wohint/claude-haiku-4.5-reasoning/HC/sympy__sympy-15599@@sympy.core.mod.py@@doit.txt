Looking at the `doit` function within the `Mod.eval` classmethod, I need to determine what inputs to `p` and `q` would produce an output of "0".

Let me trace through the function's logic:

1. First checks: If `q == S.Zero`, raises error (not this case)
2. Second checks: If infinite/nan, returns nan (not this case)  
3. **Third check**: `if p == S.Zero or p == q or p == -q or (p.is_integer and q == 1): return S.Zero`
   - This returns 0 immediately in several cases, including when `p == 0`

4. Further down: `if q.is_Number: if p.is_Number: return p % q`
   - This returns the modulo operation result, which could be 0 if p is divisible by q

Given that the output is "0", there are several possible inputs:
- `p = 0` with any non-zero `q` → returns `S.Zero` (which is 0)
- `p = 10, q = 5` → returns `10 % 5 = 0` 
- `p = 5, q = 5` → matches `p == q` case, returns `S.Zero`

The most straightforward test case for demonstrating that modular arithmetic returns 0 would be when `p % q == 0`, such as `p = 10, q = 5`.

Alternatively, `p = 0, q = 1` is the simplest case (0 mod anything is 0).

I'll go with the modulo case where 10 % 5 = 0, as it tests the actual modular arithmetic computation.
