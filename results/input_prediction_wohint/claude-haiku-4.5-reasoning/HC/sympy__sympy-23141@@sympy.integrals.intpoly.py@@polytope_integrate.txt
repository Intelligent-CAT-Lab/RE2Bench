# THOUGHT

Looking at the `polytope_integrate` function and the output "1/8", I need to determine what input would produce this result.

The function signature is:
```python
def polytope_integrate(poly, expr=None, *, clockwise=False, max_degree=None):
```

The output "1/8" is a Rational number (1/8), which would result from integrating a simple expression over a polytope.

The most straightforward case would be: **integrate the constant expression 1 over a region with area 1/8**.

A simple triangle that has area 1/8 would be one with vertices at:
- (0, 0)
- (1/2, 0) 
- (0, 1/2)

This is a right triangle with legs of length 1/2 each, so:
- Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8 ✓

When we integrate the constant 1 over this triangle, we get the area: 1/8.

            "_type": "Polygon",
            "vertices": [[0, 0], [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]
        },
        "expr": 1
    },
    "kwargs": {
        "clockwise": false,
        "max_degree": null
