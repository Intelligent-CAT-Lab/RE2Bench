[THOUGHT]
To work backwards from the output, I need to understand what `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` returns.

The output shows:
```json
{
    "_rows": 2,
    "_cols": 2,
    "_mat": null
}
```

This is the internal structure of an ImmutableDenseMatrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.

Looking at the `_matrix_derivative` function:
1. It takes `expr` (a matrix-like object) and `x` (a differentiation variable)
2. It calls `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)` which applies differentiation to each element
3. It returns either:
   - `Add.fromiter([contract_one_dims(i) for i in parts])` if rank <= 2 (most common)
   - Or `ArrayDerivative(expr, x)` for higher rank tensors

For the output to be a 2x2 matrix, the input should be:
- `expr`: A 2x2 ImmutableDenseMatrix (or similar matrix type)
- `x`: A Symbol to differentiate with respect to

The most straightforward case that produces a 2x2 matrix output would be:
1. Taking a 2x2 constant matrix and differentiating with respect to a symbol → results in ZeroMatrix(2,2) or 2x2 zero matrix
2. Or taking a 2x2 symbolic matrix and differentiating → results in a 2x2 matrix of derivatives

The simplest case would be a constant 2x2 matrix (which would produce all zeros when differentiated) or a matrix with elements that depend on the differentiation variable.

Example input: A 2x2 ImmutableDenseMatrix like `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` differentiated with respect to some Symbol `x`, or a symbolic matrix like `[[x, 2*x], [x**2, 3*x]]` differentiated with respect to `x`.
