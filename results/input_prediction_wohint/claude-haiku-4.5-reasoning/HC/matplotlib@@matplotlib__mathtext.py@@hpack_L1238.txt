[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `hpack` method to understand what inputs would produce an output of `null` (which means the function returns `None`).

The function signature is:
```python
def hpack(self, w: float=0.0, m: T.Literal['additional', 'exactly']='additional') -> None:
```

Since the output is `null`, the function executed successfully and returned `None` (all Python functions return `None` by default if no explicit return value is given, or in this case, there's an explicit `return` on line that returns `None` implicitly).

Let me trace through with the simplest input:

1. Start with `self.children = []` (empty list)
2. Initialize: `h = 0.0, d = 0.0, x = 0.0, total_stretch = [0.0]*4, total_shrink = [0.0]*4`
3. The for loop `for p in self.children:` doesn't execute since children is empty
4. Set `self.height = 0.0, self.depth = 0.0`
5. Since `m == 'additional'` (default), execute `w += x` → `w = 0.0`
6. Set `self.width = 0.0`
7. Calculate `x = w - x = 0.0 - 0.0 = 0.0`
8. Since `x == 0.0`, enter the early return branch:
   - Set `self.glue_sign = 0, self.glue_order = 0, self.glue_ratio = 0.0`
   - Return `None`

This matches the output of `null`.

For the function parameters:
- Since both `w` and `m` have default values, the method can be called with no additional arguments
- Following the example's format where `args` contains positional arguments and `kwargs` contains keyword arguments with non-default values

The simplest case uses all defaults: `args = {}` and `kwargs = {}`.

The `self` object needs at least a `children` attribute to avoid errors.
