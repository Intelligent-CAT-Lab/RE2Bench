[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through what `exptrigsimp` returns based on the output.

The output shows:
```json
{
    "nargs": {
        "_elements": "frozenset({1})"
    }
}
```

This indicates the returned object has an `nargs` attribute that is a `frozenset({1})`. In sympy, the `nargs` attribute is typically a property of function classes that indicates the number of arguments they accept. A value of `frozenset({1})` means the function accepts exactly 1 argument.

Looking at the function `exptrigsimp(expr)`:
1. It processes the input expression through various transformations (exponential, trigonometric rewrites)
2. It applies simplifications via the `bottom_up` function
3. Finally, it returns the result via `expr = newexpr` or `return expr`

The key imports include trigonometric and exponential functions like: `sin, cos, exp, cosh, tanh, sinh, tan, cot, coth` - all of which are single-argument functions with `nargs = frozenset({1})`.

For the output to have `nargs = frozenset({1})`, the input expression should be such that after simplification, it remains or becomes a single-argument function.

The simplest input would be a basic trigonometric or exponential function like `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, or `exp(x)`. When passed through `exptrigsimp`:
- These have trigonometric/exponential functions, so they get processed
- Since they're already simple single-argument functions, they remain as such
- The result has `nargs = frozenset({1})`

A natural choice is `sin(x)` or any similar single-argument function where `x` is a symbol.
