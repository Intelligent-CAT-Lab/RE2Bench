[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `__int__` method provided, I need to analyze when it could return `null`/`None`.

The `__int__` method in the `Expr` class has the return type `int`, and examining all code paths:
1. Various checks raise `TypeError` if conditions aren't met
2. All explicit return statements return an `int` value (via `return i` or expressions involving `i`)
3. There is no explicit `return None` in the method

However, the output shows `{"output": null}`, which indicates that either:
- An exception was raised during execution
- The method did not complete successfully

The most straightforward way to get `null` as output is if `__int__` raised an exception on the first check:

```python
if not self.is_number:
    raise TypeError('Cannot convert symbols to int')
```

This would occur if `self` is a symbolic expression (like a Symbol) where `is_number` evaluates to `False`.

For example, calling `int(x)` where `x` is a Symbol would trigger this exception because:
1. Symbol objects have `is_number = False` (they're not numeric values)
2. The first check fails and raises `TypeError`
3. The function doesn't return successfully, resulting in `null` output

The input would be a Symbol object (or any non-numeric Expr) with `is_number = False`.
