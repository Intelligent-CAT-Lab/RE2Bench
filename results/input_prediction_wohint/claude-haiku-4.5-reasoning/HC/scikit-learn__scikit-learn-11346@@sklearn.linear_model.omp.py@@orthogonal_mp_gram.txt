[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `orthogonal_mp_gram` function to understand what inputs would produce this output.

1. **Output Analysis**: The output is a 1D numpy array with 12 elements:
   - Only one non-zero value at index 1: 2.33249979
   - All other elements are 0.0

2. **Code Flow**:
   - At the end of the function: `return np.squeeze(coef)` (since `return_n_iter=False`)
   - The `coef` array is initialized as:
     ```python
     coef = np.zeros((len(Gram), Xy.shape[1]))  # since return_path=False
     ```
   - For the output to be 1D after squeezing, `coef` must be shape (12, 1), which means:
     - `len(Gram) = 12`
     - `Xy.shape[1] = 1`

3. **OMP Algorithm Logic**:
   - Inside the loop, `_gram_omp` is called for each column of Xy
   - It returns `(gamma, indices[:n_active], n_iter)`
   - Then: `coef[idx, k] = x` where `idx` contains the selected feature indices
   - For this output, only index 1 is non-zero, meaning only index 1 was selected by OMP

4. **Conditions for stopping at 1 feature**:
   - `n_nonzero_coefs = 1` would make the algorithm select exactly 1 feature
   - The algorithm selects the feature with maximum absolute correlation
   - For index 1 to be selected, `Xy[1]` should be the largest absolute value

5. **Computing the coefficient value**:
   - For a simple case (identity Gram matrix):
     - `gamma = Xy[1] / sqrt(Gram[1,1]) = 2.33249979 / 1 = 2.33249979`
   - This works if `Gram[1,1] = 1.0` and `Xy[1] = 2.33249979`

6. **Final configuration**:
   - Gram: 12×12 identity matrix (simplest case where OMP can isolate feature coefficients)
   - Xy: 1D array with 2.33249979 at index 1, zeros elsewhere
   - n_nonzero_coefs: 1 (to select only one feature)
   - return_path: False (as evidenced by output shape)
   - return_n_iter: False (since output is just the array, not a tuple)
