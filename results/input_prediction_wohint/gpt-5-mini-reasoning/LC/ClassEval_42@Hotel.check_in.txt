[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that make check_in return None (no explicit return executed). The method returns False in two cases: (1) if room_type not in booked_rooms keys, and (2) if name is present and room_number > booked_rooms[room_type][name]. It returns None implicitly whenever execution reaches the end without an explicit return, e.g. when:
- room_type is present in booked_rooms, and name is NOT present in booked_rooms[room_type] (the inner if is false), or
- room_type is present and name is present but room_number <= booked_rooms[room_type][name] (the == or < branches perform pop or decrement and have no return).

A simple valid input: self.booked_rooms contains the room_type key but the inner mapping does not contain the guest name. For example, booked_rooms = {"single": {}} and calling check_in("single", 1, "Alice") — the first if is false (room_type exists), the second if is false (name not present), so the function ends and returns None.
