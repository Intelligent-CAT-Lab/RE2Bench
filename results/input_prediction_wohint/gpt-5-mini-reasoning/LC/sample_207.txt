[THOUGHT]
The function starts with d = {} and then iterates over each dict c in commands, doing d.update(c). That means the final returned dict is the result of merging the dicts in commands, with later keys overwriting earlier ones. To produce {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}, commands can be a list of dicts that provide those key-value pairs. A minimal, straightforward choice is:
[{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]
Iterating and updating with these produces the desired output.
