[THOUGHT]
1. DomainMatrix.to_list simply returns self.rep.to_list().
2. The observed output is a 2x2 nested list whose elements are string representations of SymPy Matrix objects. That means rep.to_list produced exactly that 2x2 structure.
3. The simplest rep to produce such an output is a DDM (dense) whose internal rows are lists containing those Matrix objects. DDM.to_list returns [row[:] for row in self], so if DDM iterates to yield two rows each with two Matrix entries, the result matches the output.
4. So the input must be a DomainMatrix-like object whose rep is a DDM with shape (2, 2) and internal rows equal to the four Matrix values shown.
5. I will represent those Matrix objects as their string forms inside the rep's internal data.

```
{
    "self": {
        "rep": {
            "_type": "DDM",
            "_rows": [
                [
                    "Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])",
                    "Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])"
                ],
                [
                    "Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])",
                    "Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])"
                ]
            ],
            "shape": [2, 2]
        }
    }
}
```
