[THOUGHT]
The function returns all strings that contain the given substring. The output contains "grunt" and "prune", so the substring must appear in both words. "ru" appears in both "grunt" and "prune" (at index 1), so substring = "ru" is a valid choice. The input list can be the minimal list containing those two items in that order, e.g. ["grunt", "prune"], which yields exactly the given output.
