[THOUGHT]
We need the program to print 2. The printed value comes from the elif branch: print(f'{int(num[0]) + 1}').
So int(num[0]) + 1 = 2 => int(num[0]) = 1, hence num[0] must be "1" (or parse to 1).

The first if must be false: int(num[0][-1]) == 9 should be false. For num[0] = "1", last digit is 1, so that's fine.

The elif condition int(num[1][0]) >= 5 must be true. So num[1] must start with a digit >= '5' (for example "5").

Putting that together a minimal input is "1.5": num becomes ["1", "5"], first if false, elif true, and it prints 2.
