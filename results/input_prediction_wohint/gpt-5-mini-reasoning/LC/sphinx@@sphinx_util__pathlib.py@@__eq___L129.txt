[THOUGHT]
The method returns False. To get a boolean False we can have either:
- other is a PurePath (e.g., PosixPath) and super().__eq__(other) returns False because the paths differ, or
- other is a str and the string differs from self.__str__(), in which case the method warns and returns False.

To avoid involving the deprecation warning, choose the PurePath branch. If self is an _StrPath for "/tmp/a" and other is a PosixPath for "/tmp/b", isinstance(other, PurePath) is True, so the code runs super().__eq__(other) which compares the paths and returns False because "/tmp/a" != "/tmp/b".
