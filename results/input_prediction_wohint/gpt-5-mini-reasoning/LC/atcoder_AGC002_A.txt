[THOUGHT]
We need a pair (a, b) such that the code prints "Positive".

The code branches:
- It prints "Zero" if a <= 0 <= b.
- Else if a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0, it prints "Negative".
- Otherwise it prints "Positive".

To get "Positive", both prior conditions must be false.
The simplest way is to pick a > 0. Then a <= 0 is false, so it won't print "Zero", and a < 0 is false, so it won't print "Negative" either. Thus any positive a works; choose a=1 and b=2.

Simulate: input "1 2" -> a=1, b=2.
- a <= 0 is false, so not "Zero".
- a < 0 is false, so not "Negative".
- falls to else -> prints "Positive".
