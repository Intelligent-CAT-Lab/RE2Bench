[THOUGHT]
The code sorts the characters of the input string into list s and then checks:
- s[0] == s[1] (first two sorted characters equal)
- s[2] == s[3] (next two sorted characters equal)
- s[0] != s[2] (the two pairs are of different characters)

So sorted(s) must be of the form [x, x, y, y] with x != y. That means the original input must contain exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice (any order). A simple example that satisfies this is "aabb" (sorted -> ['a','a','b','b']), which makes the condition true and prints "Yes".
