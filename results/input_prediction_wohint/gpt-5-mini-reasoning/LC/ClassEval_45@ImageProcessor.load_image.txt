[THOUGHT]
The load_image method assigns self.image = Image.open(image_path) and does not return anything, so the function returns None (JSON null). That matches the provided output. The instance before calling likely has image set to None from __init__.

Therefore the input must be the ImageProcessor instance with image = None and a single positional argument image_path (a string). I'll use a simple filename like "example.png".
