[THOUGHT]
The program computes: (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 and prints 2. So (h - 2) // (t - 1) must equal 1.
That implies t-1 <= h-2 <= 2*(t-1)-1, i.e. h in [t+1, 2t-1]. Also t must not be 1 (division by zero).
A simple choice is t = 2, then h must be 3 (since h in [3,3]). Verify: (3-2)//(2-1)+1 = 1//1+1 = 2.
So the input "2 3" produces the given output.
