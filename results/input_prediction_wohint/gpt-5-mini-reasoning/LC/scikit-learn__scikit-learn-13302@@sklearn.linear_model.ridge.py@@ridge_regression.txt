[THOUGHT]
1. ridge_regression returns the fitted coefficient vector (shape (n_features,)).
2. The observed output is a 5-element vector, so X must have 5 features (and for a single target y length 5).
3. The simplest input that yields the output exactly is to make X the 5x5 identity matrix and set alpha = 0. For X = I and alpha = 0, the closed-form ridge solution is w = (I + 0·I)^{-1} y = y, so the returned coefficients equal y.
4. Therefore choose X = identity_5, alpha = 0, and y equal to the given output vector.
