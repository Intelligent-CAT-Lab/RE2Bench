[THOUGHT]
The function returns len(set(string.lower())). That counts distinct characters in the string after converting to lowercase (so case differences don't increase the count).

We need the returned value to be 5, so the lowercase version of the input must contain exactly 5 distinct characters.

A simple input that satisfies this is "abcde" — lowercased it's the same, the set is {'a','b','c','d','e'}, length 5.
