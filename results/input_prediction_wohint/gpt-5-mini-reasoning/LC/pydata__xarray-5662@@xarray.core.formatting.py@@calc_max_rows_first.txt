[THOUGHT]
The function computes max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2, which is equivalent to ceil(max_rows / 2) for nonnegative integers.

We need ceil(max_rows / 2) == 6, so max_rows can be 11 or 12 (both yield 6):
- For 11: 11//2 = 5, 11%2 = 1 -> 5 + 1 = 6
- For 12: 12//2 = 6, 12%2 = 0 -> 6 + 0 = 6

I'll pick 11 as a valid input that produces the given output 6.
