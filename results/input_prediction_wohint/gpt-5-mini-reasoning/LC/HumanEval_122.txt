[THOUGHT]
The function sums elements from arr[:k] only if len(str(elem)) <= 2.

We need the sum of the selected (first k) elements to equal 24. To keep things simple, choose integer elements so string lengths are straightforward:
- Use arr = [12, 7, 5, 100] and k = 3.
- arr[:k] -> [12, 7, 5]
- str lengths: '12' -> 2, '7' -> 1, '5' -> 1, all <= 2 so all are included.
- Sum = 12 + 7 + 5 = 24, which matches the given output.

No other elements matter since only the first k are considered.
