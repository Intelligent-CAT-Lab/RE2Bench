[THOUGHT]
The function returns [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:], so the output elements correspond to i * xs[i] for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 (since slice removes index 0).
Given output [2, 2, 0, 16]:
- 1 * xs[1] = 2  => xs[1] = 2
- 2 * xs[2] = 2  => xs[2] = 1
- 3 * xs[3] = 0  => xs[3] = 0
- 4 * xs[4] = 16 => xs[4] = 4
xs[0] is multiplied by 0 and doesn't affect the result; choose xs[0] = 0 for simplicity.
So xs = [0, 2, 1, 0, 4].
