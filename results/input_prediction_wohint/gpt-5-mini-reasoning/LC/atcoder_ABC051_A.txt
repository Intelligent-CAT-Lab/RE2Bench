[THOUGHT]
The code prints input().replace(',', ' '). So every comma in the input becomes a space in the output; other characters remain unchanged. The output is "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc" which has spaces where commas would have been. The simplest input that yields this output is "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc".

    "input": "avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
