[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer n and sets j = n*n. The first printed line is "1 64", so j (which is n*n) must be 64 → n = 8.
With n = 8, j starts at 64 and the loop prints pairs (i, j) while i < j, incrementing i and decrementing j each iteration. That produces the sequence from "1 64" up to "32 33", matching the given output.
Therefore the input is the single integer 8.
