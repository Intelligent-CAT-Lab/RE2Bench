[THOUGHT]
TR6(rv, max=4, pow=False) calls _TR56(rv, f=cos, g=sin, h=lambda x:1-x, max=max, pow=pow).

Looking at _TR56: it only changes expressions that are Pow with base.func == f (i.e., powers of cos). If rv is not a Pow, _f returns rv unchanged and bottom_up will return it as-is.

The simplest way to get output "cos(phi)" is that rv is already cos(phi). Using defaults max=4 and pow=False is consistent.

So the input is rv = cos(phi), with max and pow left as defaults.
