[THOUGHT]
The is_alive method returns the boolean result of self.hp > 0. To produce output true, self.hp must be a positive number. I'll provide a plausible RPGCharacter instance state with hp > 0 and include the other attributes initialized by __init__ (name, attack_power, defense, level) plus exp set to 0 by the constructor. No args or kwargs are needed because is_alive only takes self.
