[THOUGHT]
We know check(feature) returned True.

Looking at the code, there are three paths that can return True:
- If feature in modules: return check_module(feature). check_module returns True when the module mapped for that feature can be imported.
- If feature in codecs: return check_codec(feature). check_codec returns True when Image.core has an encoder named codec + "_encoder".
- If feature in features: return check_feature(feature). check_feature returns True when the mapped module can be imported and the requested flag attribute on that module is truthy.

Given only the final boolean True, the simplest, most robust explanation is that feature was found in modules and its mapped module was importable. A common, widely-available module used by Pillow/features is "zlib" (used for PNG compression), which typically maps to the standard "zlib" Python module; importing zlib succeeds, so check_module("zlib") would return True and thus check("zlib") returns True.

Therefore the input feature is "zlib".
