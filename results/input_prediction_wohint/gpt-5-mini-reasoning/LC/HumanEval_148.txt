[THOUGHT]
The function returns an empty sequence in three cases:
- one or both planet names are not in the known tuple (returns ()),
- the two names are equal (returns ()),
- or they are adjacent in the planet order, so the slice between them is empty.

The output shown is an empty sequence ([]). A clear valid input that yields an empty result is a pair of adjacent planets, e.g. "Earth" and "Mars":
- planet_names.index("Earth") = 2, planet_names.index("Mars") = 3
- since 2 < 3, it returns planet_names[3:3], which is an empty tuple -> represented as an empty sequence in the output.

I'll provide that input.
