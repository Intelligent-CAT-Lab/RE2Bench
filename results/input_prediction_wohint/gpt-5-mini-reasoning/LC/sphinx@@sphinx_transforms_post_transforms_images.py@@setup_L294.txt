[THOUGHT]
1. The setup function signature is setup(app: Sphinx) -> ExtensionMetadata.
2. The function calls app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader) and app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor), then returns the metadata dict.
3. To produce the shown output, the app argument only needs to provide an add_post_transform callable; no other attributes are required by this function.
4. So the input is a single argument "app" that has an add_post_transform attribute (represented here as an object placeholder).
