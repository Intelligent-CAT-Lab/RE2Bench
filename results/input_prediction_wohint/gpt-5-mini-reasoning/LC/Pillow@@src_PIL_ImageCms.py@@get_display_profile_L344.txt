[THOUGHT]
The function immediately returns None if sys.platform != 'win32', regardless of the handle value. Given the observed output null, the simplest explanation is that the function was run on a non-Windows platform, so it returned None without using core.get_display_profile_win32. The handle argument therefore can be omitted or None; I'll provide it explicitly as null (None).
