[THOUGHT]
The function iterates over the iterable names and increments numberOfNames for each element i where i.isalpha() is True. The returned value is 2, so exactly two items in names must be alphabetic strings. The simplest input that produces this is a list of two alphabetic strings such as ["Alice", "Bob"].
