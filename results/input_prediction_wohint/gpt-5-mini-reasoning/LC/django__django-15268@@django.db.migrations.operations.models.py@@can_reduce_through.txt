[THOUGHT]
We need can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label) to return True.

The method returns:
  super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label)
  OR
  (isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation) and type(operation) is not type(self))

We can guarantee True by making the second clause True:
  - operation must be an instance of AlterTogetherOptionOperation (or of a subclass)
  - type(operation) must be different from type(self)

So choose self to be an instance of a different subclass (or at least a different runtime type) than operation, while operation is an AlterTogetherOptionOperation instance. app_label can be any string (it's unused by the second clause). Therefore the call will evaluate the second clause to True and the overall result will be True.
