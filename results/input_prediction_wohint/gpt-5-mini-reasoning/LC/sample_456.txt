[THOUGHT]
The function returns s.expandtabs(tab). The simplest way to get "Join us in Hungary" is to pass a string that already equals that (no tab characters), since expandtabs leaves strings without '\t' unchanged regardless of tab value. So choose s = "Join us in Hungary" and any integer tab (e.g., 4).
