[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers vamshi and z and prints (vamshi // z + 1) * z, i.e. the smallest multiple of z strictly greater than vamshi. We need values giving output 15.

That means z must divide 15 (1, 3, 5, or 15), and vamshi must be in the range where the next multiple of z is 15:
- For z=1: vamshi must be 14.
- For z=3: vamshi can be 12, 13, or 14.
- For z=5: vamshi can be 10..14.
- For z=15: vamshi can be 0..14.

One valid simple choice is vamshi = 14 and z = 1, since (14 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (14 + 1) * 1 = 15.
