[THOUGHT]
The program does:
- reads two tokens a and b from input().
- computes b_rev = int(b[::-1]) (integer value of b reversed).
- prints int(a) + b_rev which equals 1165701527.

So int(a) + int(b[::-1]) = 1165701527.

The simplest choice is to set a = 0, so int(b[::-1]) must equal 1165701527. Therefore b must be the string representation of that number reversed.
The string "1165701527" reversed is "7251075611".

So a = "0" and b = "7251075611", with input "0 7251075611".
