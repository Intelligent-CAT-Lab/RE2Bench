[THOUGHT]
The method returns False only when an exception is raised inside the try block. The try block opens zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r') and then calls extractall(output_path). The most straightforward way for an exception to occur is that the named zip file does not exist or is not a valid zip, causing ZipFile(...) to raise (e.g., FileNotFoundError or BadZipFile). Therefore an input where self.file_name refers to a non-existent or invalid zip (e.g., "nonexistent.zip") and any output_path (e.g., "output_dir") will produce the observed False result.
