[THOUGHT]
The function builds sorted_vecs by iterating over vectors; for each vec it calls vec.sort() and appends vec. The returned list is empty, so the loop body never executed. That means vectors was an empty iterable (e.g., []). If vectors were None or non-iterable, a TypeError would occur instead of returning [].
Therefore the input must have vectors equal to an empty list.
