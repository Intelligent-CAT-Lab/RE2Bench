[THOUGHT]
The method withdraw_resume simply calls self.resumes.remove(resume) and has no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null). For that to happen without an exception, the provided resume must be present in self.resumes. I'll choose a simple resume identifier that's included in the initial resumes list.

Step-by-step:
- self.resumes initially contains the resume to be removed (e.g., "resume_abc").
- withdraw_resume("resume_abc") calls self.resumes.remove("resume_abc"), which removes it in-place.
- The method returns None (output null), matching the given output.
