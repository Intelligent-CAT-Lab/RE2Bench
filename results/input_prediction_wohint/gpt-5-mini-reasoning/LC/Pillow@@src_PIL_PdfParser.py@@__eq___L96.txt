[THOUGHT]
The __eq__ method returns True only if all three conditions hold:
- other.__class__ is self.__class__ (identity),
- other.object_id == self.object_id,
- other.generation == self.generation.

To produce output false it's enough to make any one condition fail. I'll make the class identity check fail while keeping object_id and generation equal, so the comparison short-circuits to False.

Choose:
- self.__class__ = "IndirectReference", object_id = 123, generation = 1
- other.__class__ = "SomeOtherClass", object_id = 123, generation = 1

This yields False because other.__class__ is not self.__class__.
