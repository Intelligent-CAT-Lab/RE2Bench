[THOUGHT]
The method returns False only when the provided currency is not in self.rates. The observed output is null (Python None), which means the function did not hit the explicit "return False" branch and thus returned implicitly None after updating the rate. Therefore the provided currency must exist in the converter's rates. I'll assume the object has the default rates from __init__ and pick a valid currency (e.g., "USD") with a new rate (e.g., 1.1).
