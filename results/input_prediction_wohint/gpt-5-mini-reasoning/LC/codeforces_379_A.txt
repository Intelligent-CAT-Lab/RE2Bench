[THOUGHT]
- The first loop runs x=a times and increments h and s each time, so after it: h = a, s = a.
- The second loop runs while s // b != 0, i.e. while s >= b. Each iteration increments h by 1 and reduces s by (b-1).
- If b > a, then s = a < b so the second loop does not run and h remains equal to a.
- The program prints h = 80, so one simple solution is a = 80 and any b > 80 (and b != 1 to avoid infinite loop). Choose the minimal integer b > 80, which is 81.
- Therefore a valid input is "80 81".
