[THOUGHT]
The function filters lst into negatives (x < 0) and positives (x > 0). It returns (max(negatives) if any else None, min(positives) if any else None).

The output is [-1, null], i.e. (-1, None) in Python. So:
- negatives must be non-empty and have max equal to -1 (so -1 is present and is the largest negative).
- positives must be empty (no x > 0), so the list contains no positive numbers. Zero is allowed but not required.

The simplest input satisfying this is lst = [-1] (negatives = [-1], positives = []). That yields (max([-1]) -> -1, None).
