[THOUGHT]
The function returns (x - min) / (max - min) for each x. The outputs are [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], which are evenly spaced fractions 0/4, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4. That means the input list must have five values whose min and max differ by a factor mapped to these positions. The simplest choice is numbers = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]. min = 0.0, max = 4.0; then (0/4, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4) yields the given output.
