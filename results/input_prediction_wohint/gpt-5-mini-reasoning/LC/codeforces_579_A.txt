[THOUGHT]
We need the while condition to be false initially so x remains 1. The loop condition is math.log2(n) % 1 which is nonzero when log2(n) is not an integer. So to make the condition false, math.log2(n) must be an integer — i.e., n must be a power of two (and positive). Any power of two input will produce output 1. I'll choose n = 8.
