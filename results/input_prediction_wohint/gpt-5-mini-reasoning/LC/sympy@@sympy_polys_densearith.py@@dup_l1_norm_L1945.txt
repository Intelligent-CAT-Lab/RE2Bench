[THOUGHT]
- The function returns K.sum(dup_abs(f, K)) when f is non-empty.
- dup_abs(f, K) returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f], so the result is the sum of absolute values of the coefficients.
- The observed output is 3, so the sum of absolute values must be 3.
- A simple choice is f = [1, -2], since |1| + | -2 | = 1 + 2 = 3.
- K can be a domain with zero = 0 and methods abs and sum behaving like absolute value and Python sum (represented here as placeholders in JSON).
