[THOUGHT]
The function copies the input dict and then calls popitem() on the copy, which removes the last-inserted key/value pair (insertion order). The returned dict is the copy after that removal.

We need an original dict that, after removing its last item, yields {"l": 1, "t": 2}. So the original must contain at least the pairs "l":1 and "t":2, plus one additional pair that will be removed by popitem(). I'll pick that extra pair as "p":3 and place it last in the literal so popitem() removes it. After popitem(), the copy becomes {"l":1, "t":2}, matching the given output.
