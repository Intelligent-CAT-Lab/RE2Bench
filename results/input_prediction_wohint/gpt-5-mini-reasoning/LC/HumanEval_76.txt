[THOUGHT]
We need x and n such that is_simple_power(x, n) returns True.

Function behavior:
- If n == 1, it returns x == 1 (so only (x=1, n=1) works in that branch).
- Otherwise it initializes power = 1 and repeatedly multiplies by n while power < x, then returns power == x. So it returns True when x is an exact power of n (including x=1 for any n).

Choose a simple example: x = 8 and n = 2.
Simulation:
- n != 1, so proceed.
- power = 1
- loop: power < 8 → power = 1*2 = 2
- loop: power < 8 → power = 2*2 = 4
- loop: power < 8 → power = 4*2 = 8
- loop stops (power is not < x). Return power == x → 8 == 8 → True.

Thus one valid input is x=8, n=2.
