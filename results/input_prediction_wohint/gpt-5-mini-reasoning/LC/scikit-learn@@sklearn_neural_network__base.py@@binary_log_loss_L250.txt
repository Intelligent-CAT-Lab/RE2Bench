[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (y_true, y_prob, sample_weight) such that binary_log_loss(...) returns 3.4222022694919696.

For a single sample with y_true = 1, the loss reduces to -log(y_prob). So y_prob must equal exp(-3.4222022694919696).

Compute p = exp(-3.4222022694919696) ≈ 0.03265023 (approximate to typical double precision).

Therefore a minimal input that yields the given output is:
- y_true = [1.0]
- y_prob = [0.03265023]
- sample_weight = None
