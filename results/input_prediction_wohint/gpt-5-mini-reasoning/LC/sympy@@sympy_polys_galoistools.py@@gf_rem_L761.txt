[THOUGHT]
We need f, g, p, K such that gf_rem(f,g,p,K) returns the remainder [2, 0].

gf_rem returns gf_div(f,g,p,K)[1], i.e. the remainder polynomial in the same coefficient representation (highest-power-first). A remainder of [2, 0] corresponds to the polynomial 2*x + 0 (degree 1), so deg(g) must be >= 2.

Pick a simple g of degree 2, e.g. g = x^2 represented as [1, 0, 0]. If we choose quotient q = 1 (represented [1]), then f = q*g + r = 1*x^2 + (2*x + 0) = x^2 + 2*x. In coefficient list (degree 2): f = [1, 2, 0].

Choose a modulus p where coefficients are not reduced away: p = 3 works (2 mod 3 stays 2). Use the integer domain ZZ for K (as in the example).

Thus gf_div([1,2,0], [1,0,0], 3, ZZ) should give quotient [1] and remainder [2,0], so gf_rem returns [2,0].
