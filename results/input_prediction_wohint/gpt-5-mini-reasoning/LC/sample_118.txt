[THOUGHT]
The function removes occurrences of `chars` once, then removes occurrences of `chars` repeated twice. If `chars` does not appear in `text` at all, no replacements happen and the output equals the input text.

Therefore the simplest input is the same string as the output for `text`, and any `chars` character not present in that string (e.g. "a").

    kwargs: {}
