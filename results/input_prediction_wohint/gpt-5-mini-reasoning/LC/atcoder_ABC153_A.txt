[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers h and a from a single input line, computes math.ceil(h / a), and prints the result. We need ceil(h / a) == 6.

That means 5 < h / a ≤ 6. Choose small integers satisfying this, e.g. h = 11 and a = 2 because 11 / 2 = 5.5 and ceil(5.5) = 6.

Feeding "11 2" as the input yields the printed output 6.
