[THOUGHT]
We need __eq__ to return True. The method first checks:
- other is an instance of Model (we'll represent it as a Model-like dict).
- self._meta.concrete_model == other._meta.concrete_model (make them equal).
- my_pk = self.pk; if my_pk is None then it returns self is other (same object). To avoid requiring identity, make my_pk non-None.
- It then returns my_pk == other.pk, so set both PKs equal (for example 42).

So provide inputs where both objects have the same _meta.concrete_model and the same non-None pk.
