[THOUGHT]
1. The method inspects self.value (a function) and returns ('%s.%s' % (module_name, self.value.__qualname__), {'import %s' % self.value.__module__}) when the earlier checks don't trigger.
2. The output shown is ["time.time", "{'import time'}"], which corresponds to the tuple ('time.time', {'import time'}).
3. Therefore module_name == "time" and self.value.__qualname__ == "time", so self.value is the function time.time.
4. None of the earlier branches apply: it's not a bound method on a class, not a lambda, and __module__ is not None.
5. So the input is a FunctionTypeSerializer instance whose value attribute is the function time.time.
