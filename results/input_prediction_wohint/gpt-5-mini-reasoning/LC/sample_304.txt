We need a dictionary d such that f(d) returns {"87": 7, "18": 6}.

Step-by-step simulation:
- key1 is the lexicographically largest key in d (sorted by key, reverse=True). The returned key1 is "87", so "87" must be the largest key in the original d.
- val1 = d.pop(key1) so the value for key "87" must be 7.
- After popping "87", key2 is the lexicographically largest remaining key; the returned key2 is "18", so among the remaining keys the largest must be "18".
- val2 = d.pop(key2) so the value for key "18" must be 6.

No other keys are required. The minimal input that produces the given output is d = {"87": 7, "18": 6}.
