[THOUGHT]
- The method _eval_expand_trig(self, **hints) simply returns self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints).
- The observed output shows an object with "nargs": {"_args_set": "{'1'}"}. That indicates the object returned by _calculate_reciprocal is a unary (takes 1 argument) Function-like object — i.e., nargs set to 1.
- ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction builds a reciprocal of a hyperbolic function (e.g., sinh, cosh, tanh). The reciprocal function is unary, so it's consistent that nargs._args_set == "{'1'}".
- Therefore the input must have been a ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction instance whose reciprocal-of target is a unary hyperbolic function; no hints were needed (empty kwargs).
- I'll represent the minimal input: self with a _reciprocal_of name like "sinh" and default flags, and empty kwargs.
