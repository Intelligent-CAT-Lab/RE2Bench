[THOUGHT]
The function builds and returns d = {} and only populates it inside the for loop "for key in dic:". If dic is empty, the loop body never runs, so d remains {} and the function returns {}.

Note: popitem(last=False) would be invalid for a built-in dict if executed, but it isn't executed when dic is empty. Therefore the input can simply be an empty dict.
