[THOUGHT]
We need an expr such that sstr(expr) returns "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)".

sstr creates a StrPrinter and calls p.doprint(expr) -> Printer.doprint -> str(self._print(expr)). The printer has a _print_Permutation method that, when Permutation.print_cyclic is False and the permutation's support is non-empty, will compute:
 trim = str(expr.array_form[:s[-1] + 1]) + ', size=%s' % expr.size
and if trim is shorter than the full array_form string it returns 'Permutation(%s)' % trim.

To produce "Permutation([1, 0], size=6)" we need:
- expr.size == 6
- expr.array_form begins with [1, 0] and maps indices 2..5 to themselves (so support == [0,1], s[-1]==1), e.g. array_form = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Therefore the input expr is a Permutation whose array_form is [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]. No special settings required.
