[THOUGHT]
The method only modifies state if product_id exists in self.inventory; it has no return statement, so it always returns None (null). To produce the observed output null, a valid input is calling update_product_quantity on a freshly created Warehouse (inventory is empty) with any product_id and quantity. I'll use product_id "item123" and quantity 10, and include the object's default state.
