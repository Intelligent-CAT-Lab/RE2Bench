[THOUGHT]
The function returns w ** 2 * n * pi / wavelen (after sympify). The output string is "pi*w_0**2/l", which matches pi * w_0**2 / l. That implies:
- w sympifies to a symbol named w_0,
- wavelen sympifies to a symbol named l,
- n must be 1 (the default) so it doesn't appear explicitly.

So the input should provide w="w_0", wavelen="l", and either omit n or set n=1.
