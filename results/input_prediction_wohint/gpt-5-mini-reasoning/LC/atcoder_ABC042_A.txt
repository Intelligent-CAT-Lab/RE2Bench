[THOUGHT]
The code reads three integers into ABC. It requires exactly two of them to be 5 (ABC.count(5) == 2). If so, it prints "YES" only when the sum equals 17.

With two 5s, sum = 5 + 5 + x = 10 + x must equal 17, so x = 7. Thus the three numbers must be {5, 5, 7} in any order. A valid input is "5 5 7".
