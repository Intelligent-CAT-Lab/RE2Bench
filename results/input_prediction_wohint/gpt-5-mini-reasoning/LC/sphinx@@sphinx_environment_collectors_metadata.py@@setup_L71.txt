[THOUGHT]
The setup function takes a single argument app and always returns the same metadata dict. During execution it calls app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector). That means the input must be a Sphinx application-like object that provides an add_env_collector method. The precise internal state of app doesn't affect the returned dict, only that the method exists and can be called with the collector class.

I'll provide a minimal representation of the app showing it's a Sphinx instance and that it exposes add_env_collector.
