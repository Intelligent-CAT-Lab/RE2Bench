[THOUGHT]
The heal method does:
- self.hp += 10
- if self.hp > 100: self.hp = 100
- return self.hp

To get a return value of 100, the hp after adding 10 must be >= 100. That means the initial hp could be 90 (90+10 = 100) or any value >90 (which will be capped to 100). I'll choose an initial hp of 95 (a typical value in range >90) and provide reasonable values for the other RPGCharacter fields.
