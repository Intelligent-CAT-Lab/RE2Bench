[THOUGHT]
The program prints count = b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm, where lcm = LCM(x, y).
To get output 57900, choose lcm = 1 so the count becomes b - (a - 1) = b - a + 1 = 57900.
The simplest integers with LCM 1 are x = 1 and y = 1. Pick a = 1 and b = 57900 so the count is 57900.
Thus the input line is "1 1 1 57900".
