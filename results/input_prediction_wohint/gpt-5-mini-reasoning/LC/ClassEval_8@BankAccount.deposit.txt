[THOUGHT]
The deposit method adds amount to self.balance and returns the new balance. To get an output of 300, the sum self.balance + amount must equal 300. The amount must be non-negative (amount < 0 would raise ValueError). The simplest possibility is starting balance 0 and depositing 300, yielding 0 + 300 = 300.
