[THOUGHT]
The method construct_stop_word_list has no parameters besides self and constructs a fixed local list ['a', 'an', 'the'] which it returns. The call does not depend on any attributes of the instance, so self can be any instance of NLPDataProcessor (no fields required). There are no positional or keyword arguments.
