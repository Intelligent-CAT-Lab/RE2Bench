[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers anti, b, c, d.

It computes l = |anti - c| and m = |b - d|.
- If anti == c: prints (anti + m, b, c + m, d) — first and third would be equal.
- Elif b == d: prints (anti, b + l, c, d + l) — second and fourth would be equal.
- Elif l != m: prints -1.
- Else (l == m and anti != c and b != d): prints (anti, d, c, b).

Given output "3 8 7 4", the first and third (3 and 7) are different, so not the anti==c branch.
Second and fourth (8 and 4) are different, so not the b==d branch.
Output is not -1, so l must equal m and we are in the else branch, which prints anti, d, c, b.

Thus:
anti = 3
d = 8
c = 7
b = 4

Input order is "anti b c d" → "3 4 7 8". Verify: l = |3-7| = 4, m = |4-8| = 4, l == m and anti != c and b != d, so prints "3 8 7 4" as required.
