[THOUGHT]
The code reads three integers A, B, T and computes ans = (T // A) * B. We need integers such that (T // A) * B = 1.

Let q = T // A (an integer). Then q * B = 1. Integer factorizations of 1 are (q=1, B=1) or (q=-1, B=-1). I'll choose the positive solution.

So take q = 1 and B = 1. q = 1 means T // A = 1, i.e., A <= T < 2A. The simplest choice is A=1 and T=1 (then T//A = 1). That gives A=1, B=1, T=1 and ans = 1.
