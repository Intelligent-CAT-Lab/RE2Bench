[THOUGHT]
re.split returns substrings between matches and, if the pattern has capturing groups, the captured group texts interleaved. The output list has 4 elements: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].

That corresponds to a single match (n=1) with two capturing groups (g=2), producing [part_before, group1, group2, part_after]. The empty strings at positions 0 and 3 mean the match covered the entire input string. Therefore the input text must be the concatenation of the two captured groups: " abiguygusu  kjgufwycs " (note the double space between because group1 ends with a space and group2 begins with a space). A simple pattern that produces those captures is "( abiguygusu )( kjgufwycs )".
