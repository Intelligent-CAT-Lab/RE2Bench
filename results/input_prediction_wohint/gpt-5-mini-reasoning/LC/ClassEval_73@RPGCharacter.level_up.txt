The method increases level by 1 and adds (hp +20, attack_power +5, defense +5). The output tuple is (level_after, hp_after, attack_after, def_after) = (4, 160, 35, 25).

Invert the changes to get the input object's state before calling level_up:
- level_before = 4 - 1 = 3
- hp_before = 160 - 20 = 140
- attack_power_before = 35 - 5 = 30
- defense_before = 25 - 5 = 20

level_up takes no positional arguments, so args is empty and kwargs is empty. The object may have a name and exp, but only the above fields are necessary for the result.
