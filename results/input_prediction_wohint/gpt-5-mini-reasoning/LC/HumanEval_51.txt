[THOUGHT]
The function removes all vowels (a, e, i, o, u, case-insensitive) and preserves other characters (including newlines). The output is "bcdf\nghjklm", so the consonant sequence (and newline position) in the input must be b c d f newline g h j k l m, with any vowels possibly interspersed.

A simple input is to insert a vowel between each consonant. For the first line use "bacedif" -> b a c e d i f -> removes vowels -> "bcdf". For the second line use "gahejikolum" -> g a h e j i k o l u m -> removes vowels -> "ghjklm". Combining with a newline gives "bacedif\ngahejikolum", which yields the required output when passed to remove_vowels.
