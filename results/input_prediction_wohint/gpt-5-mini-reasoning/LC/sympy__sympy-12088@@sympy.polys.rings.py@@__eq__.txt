[THOUGHT]
We need p1 and p2 such that PolyElement.__eq__(p1, p2) returns True.

Look at the code branches:
- First branch: if not p2: return not p1. So if p2 is falsy and p1 is falsy, result is True. This is the simplest way to get True without needing PolyElement.ring or dict equality.
- Other branches require p2 to be a PolyElement or p1 to have length <=1; those are more complex.

So choose p1 as an empty PolyElement (empty dict-like → falsy) and p2 as 0 (falsy). Then "if not p2" is True and "not p1" is True, so the method returns True, matching the given output.

Representing the empty PolyElement as an empty JSON object {} and p2 as 0.
