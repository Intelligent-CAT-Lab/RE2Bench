[THOUGHT]
The method restock_item returns True only if item_name is already a key in self.inventory. The output is false, so the item_name must not be present in inventory. By default a new VendingMachine has an empty inventory ({}), so the simplest input is calling restock_item with any item name not in the empty inventory (e.g., "Soda") and some quantity (e.g., 10). Include self state showing empty inventory and balance 0.
