The output is two lines separated by '\n':
- line1 output: "#[)[]>[^e>"
- line2 output: " 8"

f splits txt on '\n' and centers each line to width marker using str.center(width), which pads with spaces. If width <= len(s), center returns the original string unchanged.

The first output line has no added spaces, so either marker <= len(line1) or the line originally had those spaces. The simplest is marker <= len(line1), so line1 is unchanged and must be "#[)[]>[^e>".

The second output is " 8" (one leading space then '8'). For a single character "8" centered into width 2, total padding = 1 (odd), and Python's str.center gives the extra space to the left, producing " 8". That implies marker == 2 and the original second line was "8".

Thus txt must be "#[)[]>[^e>\n8" and marker must be 2.
