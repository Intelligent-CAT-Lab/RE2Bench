[THOUGHT]
The function sums i**2 for every element i in lst that satisfies:
- i > 0
- i % 2 != 0 (odd)
- '.' not in str(i) (string form does not contain a dot)

Since any such i is a positive odd integer, its square is > 0. The only way the sum is 0 is that no list elements pass all three filters. The simplest input that ensures this is an empty list (no elements to include), which yields sum([]) == 0.
