[THOUGHT]
The function returns array.index(elem) if elem is in array, otherwise -1. The observed output is 0, so elem must be present in array and its first occurrence must be at index 0 (the beginning of the list). Therefore the array must have elem as its first element. One valid simple choice is array = [1, 2, 3] and elem = 1, which yields index 0.
