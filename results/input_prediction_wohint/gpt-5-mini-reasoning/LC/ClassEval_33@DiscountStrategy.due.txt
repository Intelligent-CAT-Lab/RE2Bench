[THOUGHT]
The due() method does:
- If promotion is None, discount = 0, else discount = self.promotion(self).
- It returns self.__total - discount.

To get output 139.5 with no arguments, the simplest case is promotion is None so discount = 0 and therefore self.__total must equal 139.5.

The instance attribute __total is name-mangled to _DiscountStrategy__total on the instance. So set _DiscountStrategy__total to 139.5 and promotion to null/None. customer and cart can be anything (use null).
