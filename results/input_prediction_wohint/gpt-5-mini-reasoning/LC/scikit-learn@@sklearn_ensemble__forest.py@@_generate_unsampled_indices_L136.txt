1. The function returns unsampled_indices = np.arange(n_samples)[sample_counts == 0]. The largest index in the output is 149, so n_samples must be at least 150. It's natural (and common in sklearn) that n_samples equals 150 here, so indices go 0..149.

2. The output contains 56 indices. For bootstrap sampling, when n_samples_bootstrap == n_samples, the expected number of unsampled samples is about 0.368 * n_samples ≈ 55.2, which matches 56. So it's very likely n_samples_bootstrap == 150 as well.

3. The exact unsampled set depends on the RNG state. Many random_state values could produce this particular unsampled set; a typical deterministic choice is random_state = 0. Using random_state=0 with n_samples=150 and n_samples_bootstrap=150 is a plausible input that yields the given output.

Therefore the predicted inputs are random_state = 0, n_samples = 150, n_samples_bootstrap = 150.
