[THOUGHT]
The method returns True only if the try block succeeds: Document(self.file_path) opened without raising, doc.add_heading(heading, level) ran, and doc.save(self.file_path) saved. Therefore the provided self.file_path must refer to an accessible .docx file (or at least Document(...) did not error), and the call included a heading string (level can be omitted and default to 1). A minimal plausible input is a DocFileHandler with file_path pointing to an existing docx (e.g., "test.docx") and a heading string, using the default level.
