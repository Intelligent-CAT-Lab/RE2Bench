[THOUGHT]
The method auto_set_mode is an instance method that takes no arguments and returns nothing (implicitly returns None, which maps to null in JSON). It updates self.mode based on comparing self.current_temperature to self.target_temperature:
- If current_temperature < target_temperature -> mode becomes 'heat'
- Otherwise -> mode becomes 'cool'

Given the output is null, we only know the method returned None; any valid Thermostat instance will produce that output when auto_set_mode is called. I'll pick a concrete instance where current_temperature (68) is less than target_temperature (72), so the method will set mode to 'heat'. No args or kwargs are passed.
