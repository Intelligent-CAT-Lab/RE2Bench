[THOUGHT]
I need to find inputs (polynomials, facets, hp_params) that produce the final integral_value -1/8.

Look at _polynomial_integrate:
- dims length = 2, so for each polynomial degree deg the contribution is poly_contribute /= (dim_length + deg) = (2 + deg).
- For each facet (hp entry) the code calls integration_reduction(facets, index, a, b, expr, dims, degree) and then multiplies the returned value by (hp[1] / norm(hp[0])). facet index is assigned by the loop via facet_count.

Examine integration_reduction for a constant polynomial (degree 0):
- inner_product = diff(expr, x)*x0[0] + diff(expr, y)*x0[1] → zero for a constant, so no recursion.
- It calls left_integral2D(m, index, facets, x0, expr, gens):
  - left_integral2D sums over intersections of the current facet with its adjacent facets, and for each intersection vertex adds distance_origin * expr(substituted at that vertex).
  - For a triangle and choosing facet 0 = segment AB with x0 = A, the intersection with the next facet (BC) is B, giving distance_origin = |B - A| = length(AB). The other adjacent intersection (with previous facet CA) gives A and distance 0. So left_integral2D returns length(AB) * c for constant c.

Thus for a single polynomial degree 0 with constant c, for facet 0 integration_reduction returns length(AB) * c. After multiplying by hp[1]/norm(hp[0]) and dividing by (2 + deg = 2), the contribution to integral_value is (length(AB) * c * (hp1 / norm(a))) / 2.

To get -1/8:
- choose length(AB) = 1 (so pick A=(0,0), B=(1,0)),
- choose c = -1/4,
- pick hp for facet 0 with hp1 = 1 and hp[0] = (1,0) so hp1 / norm(hp0) = 1/1 = 1,
- then contribution = (1 * -1/4 * 1) / 2 = -1/8.

We must ensure other facets' contributions vanish: provide hp entries for facets 1 and 2 with hp1 = 0 so their contributions are multiplied by zero.

So use a triangle with vertices A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(0,1) and edges:
- facet 0: AB with points [[0,0],[1,0]]
- facet 1: BC with points [[1,0],[0,1]]
- facet 2: CA with points [[0,1],[0,0]]

polynomials: degree 0 -> -1/4

hp_params: [
  (a=(1,0), b=1) for facet 0,
  (a=(1,0), b=0) for facet 1,
  (a=(1,0), b=0) for facet 2
]

This yields exactly integral_value = -1/8 as required.
