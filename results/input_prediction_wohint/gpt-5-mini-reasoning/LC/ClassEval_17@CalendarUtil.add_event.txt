[THOUGHT]
The add_event method appends the provided event to self.events and does not return anything, so the observable output is null/None. This matches the given output.

There is no other information to constrain the event value, so a reasonable prediction is that self starts with an events list (empty or not) and that a typical event object (e.g., a dictionary describing an event) was passed. I'll choose a common example event dictionary and show self with an initially empty events list.
