[THOUGHT]
The add_book method always returns None (no return statement), so the observed output null gives no direct info about the title or quantity. The simplest plausible call is on a fresh BookManagement instance (inventory = {}) adding one copy of a book using the default quantity.

I'll therefore assume a newly constructed BookManagement (inventory: {}), title "New Book", and default quantity 1. The call has no kwargs.
