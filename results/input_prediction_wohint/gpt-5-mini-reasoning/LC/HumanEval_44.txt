[THOUGHT]
The function builds a string representation of x in the given base by repeatedly taking x % base and prepending it. To get the single-character output "4", the loop must run once producing the remainder 4, which implies x % base == 4 and after integer division x //= base becomes 0. That means the initial x is 4 and base > 4 (so x < base). The simplest choice is x = 4 and base = 10.
