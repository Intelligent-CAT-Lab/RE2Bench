[THOUGHT]
We need to find an input to VendingMachine.add_item that is consistent with the observed output null (i.e., Python None). The add_item method has no return statement, so it always returns None regardless of inputs. Therefore many inputs would produce the observed output.

To give a concrete, minimal, and consistent input, choose a typical call where the machine initially has no such item in inventory. In that case restock_item(item_name, quantity) will return False (because item_name is not in inventory), so add_item will set inventory[item_name] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity} and then implicitly return None.

So use an initial self state with an empty inventory and zero balance, and typical arguments like item_name "Soda", price 125, quantity 10. The kwargs are empty.
