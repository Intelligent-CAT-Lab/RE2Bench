[THOUGHT]
The program reads an integer n. It divides out factors of 2 while n % 2 == 0. It prints "YES" only if the result equals 1 (i.e., n is a power of two). To get output "NO", n must not be a power of two. The simplest choice is n = 3.

Simulate:
- n = 3
- 3 % 2 != 0, so the while loop is skipped
- n == 1 is false, so the program prints "NO"
