[THOUGHT]
The function converts text to a list of characters and, if to_remove is present, finds its first index, removes that character, inserts a '?' at the same index, then removes the first '?' — which results in the original string with the first occurrence of to_remove removed (assuming no earlier '?' exists).

We need an original text such that removing its first occurrence of to_remove yields "sjbrfqmw". That means the original text is "sjbrfqmw" with one extra character (to_remove) inserted at the position of its first occurrence.

A simple choice: insert 'a' after the first character:
- text = "sajbrfqmw"
- to_remove = "a"

Simulate:
- list -> ['s','a','j','b','r','f','q','m','w']
- 'a' in list, index = 1
- remove 'a' -> ['s','j','b','r','f','q','m','w']
- insert '?' at index 1 -> ['s','?','j','b','r','f','q','m','w']
- remove '?' -> back to ['s','j','b','r','f','q','m','w']
- join -> "sjbrfqmw" (matches output)
