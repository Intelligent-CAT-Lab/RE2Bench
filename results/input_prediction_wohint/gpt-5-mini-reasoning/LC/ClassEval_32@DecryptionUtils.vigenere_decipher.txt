[THOUGHT]
We need a ciphertext that, when passed to vigenere_decipher with the given self.key, yields the decrypted_text "AbCdEfG".

Look at the method: for each alphabetic char, it computes shift = ord(self.key[key_index % len(self.key)].lower()) - ord('a'), then computes decrypted_char by subtracting shift from the ciphertext letter (mod 26), and preserves case based on whether the ciphertext char is uppercase.

If we choose a key whose letters are 'a' (shift 0), decryption subtracts 0 and returns the ciphertext letter unchanged (preserving case). So with self.key = "a", the ciphertext must be exactly the output "AbCdEfG" to produce that decrypted_text.

Thus the input is self.key = "a" and ciphertext = "AbCdEfG".
