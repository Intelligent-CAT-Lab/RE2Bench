[THOUGHT]
The method returns None (null) only when the given order_id exists in self.orders, because the function sets the status and has no return statement in that branch. If the order_id were missing it would return False instead. Therefore the input must provide a Warehouse-like self where orders contains the used order_id.

I'll pick a simple example: self has an empty inventory and orders contains order_id "order_1" (with some prior status like "pending"). The call provides order_id "order_1" and a new status, e.g. "shipped". This will update the existing entry and return None.
