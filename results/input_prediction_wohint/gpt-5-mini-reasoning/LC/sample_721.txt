[THOUGHT]
The function sorts nums in place (nums.sort()) repeatedly inside a loop, then returns nums. Sorting multiple times doesn't change the final result: the returned list is just the input elements sorted ascending. The output is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2], so the input must be a list containing exactly those five numbers in some order. I'll provide one valid permutation (unsorted) as the input, e.g. [2, -5, -8, -6, -7].
