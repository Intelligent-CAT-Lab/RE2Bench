[THOUGHT]
clean_non_binary_chars is an instance method that takes only self and has no return (implicitly returns None), so the observed output null only tells us the function returned None. In the class, __init__ assigns self.binary_string from the constructor argument and immediately calls clean_non_binary_chars(), which filters self.binary_string to keep only '0' and '1' characters.

The output doesn't reveal the original string, so the exact initial binary_string cannot be uniquely determined from the output. I'll provide a plausible input where the original string contains non-binary characters that the method would remove (for example "a1b0c1"), which after running clean_non_binary_chars() would leave "101". The call to clean_non_binary_chars itself receives only self and no other args.
