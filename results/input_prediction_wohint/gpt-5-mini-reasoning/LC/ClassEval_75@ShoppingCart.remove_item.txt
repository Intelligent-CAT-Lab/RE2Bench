[THOUGHT]
The method remove_item has no return statement, so it always returns None (JSON null). It mutates self.items only when the given item exists by subtracting quantity; otherwise it does nothing.

A valid input that produces the shown output is, for example, a ShoppingCart whose items already contains "apple" with quantity 3, and remove_item is called with item="apple" and quantity=2. The method will subtract 2 leaving quantity 1, and still return None.
