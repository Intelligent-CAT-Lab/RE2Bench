[THOUGHT]
get_gpa returns the average of the student's course grades if the student exists and has at least one course. To produce 75.0, the student's courses can average to 75. For simplicity, use one course with grade 75.

So set self.students to include a student "Alice" whose 'courses' dict has one entry (e.g. "math": 75). Calling get_gpa("Alice") yields sum([75]) / 1 = 75.0.
