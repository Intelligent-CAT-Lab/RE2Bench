[THOUGHT]
The function maps each element of `array` to `'n' * num`, collects those into `just_ns`, then appends each to `final_output` and returns it. The returned list is empty, so `final_output` must have had no elements. That implies `just_ns` was empty, which only happens if the input `array` was empty (or an empty iterable). The simplest input is an empty list.
