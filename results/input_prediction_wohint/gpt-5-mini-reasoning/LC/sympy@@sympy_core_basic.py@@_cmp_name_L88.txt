[THOUGHT]
1. The function gets two types x and y. It compares their __name__ strings n1 and n2.
2. If n1 == n2 it would return 0, so they must differ.
3. If not issubclass(y, Basic) it would return -1, so y must be a subclass of Basic.
4. It computes indices i1 and i2 by looking up n1 and n2 in ordering_of_classes; if a name is not present its index becomes UNKNOWN.
5. If both indices are UNKNOWN it returns (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2) — i.e. standard lexicographic string comparison (1 when n1 > n2).
6. To produce output 1 most simply: make both names absent from ordering_of_classes and choose n1 > n2 lexicographically, and ensure y is a subclass of Basic.
7. Example choice: x.__name__ = "zeta", y.__name__ = "alpha". "zeta" != "alpha"; assume neither name is in ordering_of_classes → both UNKNOWN; issubclass(y, Basic) is True (y inherits Basic); lexicographic comparison "zeta" > "alpha" yields 1.
