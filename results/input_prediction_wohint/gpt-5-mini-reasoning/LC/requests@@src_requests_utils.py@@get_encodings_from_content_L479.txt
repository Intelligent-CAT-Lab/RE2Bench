[THOUGHT]
We need content that makes the function return a single-item list ["UTF-8"].

The function builds three regexes (charset meta, pragma meta with content; xml declaration) and returns the concatenation of all matches. To get exactly one "UTF-8" in the output, provide content with a single match (and no other matches). A simple choice is an HTML meta tag using the charset attribute, e.g. <meta charset="UTF-8">. That will be matched by charset_re and yield ["UTF-8"]. The deprecation warning emitted by warnings.warn does not affect the return value.
