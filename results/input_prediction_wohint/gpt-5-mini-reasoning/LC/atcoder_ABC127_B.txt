Let y1..y10 be the printed sequence. Recurrence: y_{n+1} = r*y_n - D.

From y1=110 and y2=120:
120 = r*110 - D -> D = 110r - 120

From y2=120 and y3=140:
140 = r*120 - D
Substitute D: 140 = r*120 - (110r - 120) = 10r + 120
10r = 20 -> r = 2

Then D = 110*2 - 120 = 220 - 120 = 100.

Initial x (call x0) satisfies y1 = 2*x0 - 100 = 110 -> 2*x0 = 210 -> x0 = 105.

So input (r, D, x) is "2 100 105". I can verify quickly: 2*105-100=110, 2*110-100=120, ... matches the full sequence.
