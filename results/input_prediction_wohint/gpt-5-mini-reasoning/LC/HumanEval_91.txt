[THOUGHT]
The function splits the string S on sentence-ending punctuation and counts sentences whose first two characters equal 'I '. An output of 0 means none of the split sentences start with "I ".

A simple valid input that yields 0 is "Hello world." After splitting this becomes ['Hello world', ''] and neither starts with 'I ', so the sum is 0.
