[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to math_to_image such that it returns depth == 1.0. The function returns the third value (depth) returned by MathTextParser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop). So we pick a simple math string s for which parse would plausibly return depth 1.0 under the default font and dpi. The other parameters (prop, dpi, format, color) can be left as None, and filename_or_obj can be a normal path string like "out.png". With these inputs parse is called and (by assumption) yields depth 1.0, which is then returned unchanged.

Thus provide the call arguments: s = "x", filename_or_obj = "out.png", and prop/dpi/format/color = null.
