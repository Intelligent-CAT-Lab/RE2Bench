[THOUGHT]
1. The function always returns the result of create_cookie(...). The JSON output shows null, which is consistent with a non-JSON-serializable Cookie object being returned (serialized as null). So the function likely succeeded and returned a Cookie instance rather than raising.
2. To avoid raising a TypeError from the max-age handling, morsel['max-age'] must be either empty/falsy or a valid integer string. I'll choose an empty string so the code falls through to the expires branch (or leaves expires as None if expires also falsy).
3. To avoid parsing expires, make morsel['expires'] falsy too; then expires stays None.
4. Provide the other fields the function reads: 'comment', 'domain', 'path', 'httponly', 'secure', 'version' and also morsel.key and morsel.value (used as name and value). Use simple, typical values (e.g., key "sessionid", value "abc123", path "/").
5. Represent morsel as a mapping with the string keys and also include 'key' and 'value' attributes so both indexing and attribute access in the function are satisfied.

Therefore the predicted input morsel is below.
