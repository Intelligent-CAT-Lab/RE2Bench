[THOUGHT]
The method returns type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month).
The observed output has n = -1 and month = 2, so:
- self.month must be 2.
- other * self.n must equal -1.

other cannot be a float (the method returns NotImplemented for floats), so choose integer values. The simplest choice is self.n = 1 and other = -1 (since -1 * 1 = -1). This satisfies both conditions.
