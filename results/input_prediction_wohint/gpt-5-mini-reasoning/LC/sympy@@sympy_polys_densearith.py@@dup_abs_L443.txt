[THOUGHT]
The function returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]. The output is [2], so the comprehension produced a single-element list with value 2.

That means f must be an iterable with exactly one element coeff such that K.abs(coeff) == 2.
The simplest, clear choice is coeff = -2 and K.abs computes the absolute value, so K.abs(-2) -> 2.
(Alternatively f could be [2] and K.abs could be the identity, but the conventional interpretation is that K.abs is absolute value.)

Therefore:
- f = [-2]
- K is a domain-like object exposing an abs operation that returns the absolute value (represented here as the built-in abs).

I'll represent K as an object with "abs" set to "abs" to indicate the absolute-value operation.
