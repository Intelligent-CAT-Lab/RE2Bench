[THOUGHT]
The function inserts the single element `added` at position `idx` into the list `nums` via slice assignment nums[idx:idx] = (added,). That increases the list length by 1.

Final output is [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], so the original list must have length 5 and inserting one element produced this 6-element list. Removing the inserted element from the final list at the insertion index should yield the original list.

If I assume the inserted value is 2 and it was inserted at index 1, removing the element at index 1 from the final list gives [2, 3, 2, 3, 3], which can be the original `nums`. Inserting 2 at index 1 into [2, 3, 2, 3, 3] yields the given output.

Therefore:
- nums = [2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
- idx = 1
- added = 2
