[THOUGHT]
- The function setup(app: Sphinx) calls app.add_transform(...) five times (with the listed transform classes) and then returns a static metadata dict:
  {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}.
- The returned output shown matches that static dict exactly, so the return value does not depend on the internals of app.
- The only requirement for the input app is that it be a Sphinx application-like object exposing add_transform (which delegates to a registry with add_transform). For the purpose of predicting the input, it's sufficient to supply an app object with a registry and an add_transform placeholder.
- I'll represent the app as an object with a registry (empty dict) and an add_transform placeholder (empty dict), matching the simple style used in the example.
