[THOUGHT]
1. The parse function returns Version(version) if Version(version) doesn't raise InvalidVersion.
2. The observed output is "<Version('1.11.3')>", meaning parse returned a Version instance representing "1.11.3".
3. Therefore the input string passed to parse was "1.11.3" (which the Version.__init__ regex accepts and parses into release tuple (1, 11, 3)).
4. No other information (kwargs or different variable names) is needed.
