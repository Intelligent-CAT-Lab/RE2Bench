[THOUGHT]
We need an input rv such that TR111(rv) returns cos(phi)**2.

TR111 applies bottom_up with f. f only transforms when rv is a Pow and (rv.base.is_positive or (rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative)) is True. For cos(phi)**2:
- rv is a Pow.
- rv.exp is 2 (an integer) but not negative, so (rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative) is False.
- rv.base.is_positive is likely None (falsy).
Therefore the condition fails and f returns rv unchanged. bottom_up will rebuild but not change the expression. So TR111(cos(phi)**2) yields cos(phi)**2.

Thus the input rv is simply the sympy expression cos(phi)**2.
