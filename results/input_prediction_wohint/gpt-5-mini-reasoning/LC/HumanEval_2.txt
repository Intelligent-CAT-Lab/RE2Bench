[THOUGHT]
The function returns number % 1.0, i.e. the fractional part of the input float. The observed output is 0.33000000000000007, so the input's fractional part must be 0.33000000000000007. Any number of the form n + 0.33000000000000007 (with integer n) would produce this result. The simplest choice is to use the value itself: 0.33000000000000007.
