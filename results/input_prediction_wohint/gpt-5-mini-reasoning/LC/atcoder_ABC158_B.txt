[THOUGHT]
The code computes ans = (N // (A+B)) * A + min(N % (A+B), A).

To get output 0, both terms must be 0. An easy way is to set N = 0 (then N // (A+B) = 0 and N % (A+B) = 0, so min(...) = 0). A and B can be any integers (choose positive for simplicity).

I'll use N = 0, A = 5, B = 3, so the input line is "0 5 3".
