[THOUGHT]
The function computes summation of integers from n to m but the average simplifies: average = summation / (m - n + 1) = (n + m) / 2 for a consecutive integer range. The return is bin(round((n + m) / 2)). The output binary "0b101101110" equals decimal 366.

So we need round((n + m) / 2) == 366. That means (n + m) / 2 must round to 366. Possible sums n + m include 732 (gives exactly 366), 731 (365.5 → rounds to 366 in Python), or 733 (366.5 → rounds to 366). Choose a simple valid pair with m >= n, e.g. n = 365 and m = 367 (365 + 367 = 732 → average 366). This yields the given output.
