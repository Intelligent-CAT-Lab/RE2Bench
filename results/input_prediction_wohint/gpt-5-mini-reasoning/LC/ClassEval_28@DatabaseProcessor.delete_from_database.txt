[THOUGHT]
The method delete_from_database connects to the SQLite file self.database_name, runs a DELETE query against the provided table_name with a parameterized name, commits, closes the connection, and does not return anything (implicitly returns None -> null in JSON).

Given the output is null, the call completed without raising an exception. Any plausible inputs consisting of a valid database filename (string), a table name (string), and a name value (string) would produce null on success. I'll pick common example values:

- self.database_name: "example.db"
- table_name: "users"
- name: "Alice"

With these inputs, the method will execute: DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ? with parameter ("Alice",), commit, close, and return None (null).
