[THOUGHT]
The code does:
- a, b = input().split()
- b = b[0] + b[2:]  # removes the second character of the second token
- a = int(a); b = int(b)
- prints a * b // 100

The printed value is 2017634310362021, so a * b // 100 = 2017634310362021.
This means a * b is in [201763431036202100, 201763431036202199]. A simple choice is to make a * b = 201763431036202100 exactly (so the //100 yields the given value).

Choose b (after removal) = 100 and a = 2017634310362021. Then a*b = 201763431036202100, and a*b//100 = 2017634310362021 as required.

We must provide an original second token whose b[0] + b[2:] equals "100". For example, original b = "1100":
- b[0] = '1', b[2:] = '00' -> combined "100".

So the input line should be: "2017634310362021 1100".
