[THOUGHT]
The method __invert__ returns self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form)).
The output object has "_array_form": null and "_size": 5, so _af_new must have been called with a value that produced an object whose _array_form is None and _size is 5.

The simplest/most direct explanation is that _af_invert(self._array_form) evaluated to None, so self._array_form was None (or something whose invert yields None). The input object therefore had _array_form = None and _size = 5. There are no other arguments to __invert__.
