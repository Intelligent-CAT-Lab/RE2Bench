[THOUGHT]
The function returns the last k sorted elements of arr (or [] if k == 0). The output is a list of length 2, so k must be 2. After sorting, the last two elements are [-4, 4], so the sorted arr must end with -4, 4. The simplest arr producing that is [-4, 4] (other valid arr values could include extra elements <= -4 before them, but the minimal input is [-4, 4] with k = 2).
