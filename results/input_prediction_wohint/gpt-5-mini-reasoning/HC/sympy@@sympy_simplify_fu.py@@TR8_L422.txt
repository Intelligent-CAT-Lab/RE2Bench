[THOUGHT]
We need an input rv that TR8 will transform into cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2.

The identity (cos(2*phi) + 1)/2 equals cos(phi)**2. TR8's code handles Pow with base cos and integer exponent: when first=True it recurses with first=False into the power; the first=False branch treats an integer power of cos by expanding it into repeated factors and applying product-to-sum identities. For cos(phi)**2 this yields (cos(2*phi) + cos(0))/2 = cos(2*phi)/2 + 1/2.

Therefore a natural input is rv = cos(phi)**2 (with default first=True).
