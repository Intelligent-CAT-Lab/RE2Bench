[THOUGHT]
The method update_from_data_xy immediately returns if len(xy) == 0. The observed output is null (None), so the simplest explanation is that xy was an empty sequence. In that case, self is not accessed/modified by the method. I'll provide a minimal plausible self state for a Bbox and set xy to an empty list.
