[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to Quantity._result_as_quantity that would produce an object whose _unit matches the provided dict. Looking at the method:

- If out is a Quantity instance, the method calls out._set_unit(unit) and returns out.
- _set_unit stores the passed unit (after possible conversion) on out._unit.

Therefore, to get the shown output (an object with _unit matching the given Unit-like dictionary), the call must have provided:
- out: a Quantity-like object (represented here with an initially null _unit),
- unit: a Unit-like object whose attributes match the provided dict,
- result: can be any value (it is unused when out is a Quantity),
- self: any Quantity instance (not used in this branch, but included as the bound instance).

I'll supply a minimal self and out and set unit to the given Unit-like structure. No kwargs are required.
