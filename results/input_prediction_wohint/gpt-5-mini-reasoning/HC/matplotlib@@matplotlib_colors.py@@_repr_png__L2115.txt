[THOUGHT]
- The PNG bytes start with a 256x256 IHDR (0x0100 = 256 for width and height), so the colormap lookup table used to create the PNG must be 256x256 in size (or repeated up to that size). Thus self.N and self.M are 256 (the class defaults are 256).
- The PNG Title text is "BiCone BivarColormap", so the BivarColormap instance had name = "BiCone".
- _repr_png_ uses self.lut (which triggers _init() if _isinit is False) and then writes an RGBA (4-channel) 8-bit PNG. For this output the shape is square (no circular masking applied), so the instance shape is not 'circle'/'circleignore' — the default 'square' fits.
- To produce a 256x256 RGBA image the object must already have an initialized lookup table _lut with shape (256,256,4) and values in [0,1] (they are multiplied by 255 and cast to uint8). So the self state should have _isinit = true and a 256x256x4 lut.
- The call has no additional args or kwargs; only self is passed.

Therefore the input object (self) should have name "BiCone", N and M 256, shape "square", _isinit true, and a _lut array of shape (256,256,4) with float colors in [0,1]. I represent the LUT with a short descriptive placeholder in the JSON input.
