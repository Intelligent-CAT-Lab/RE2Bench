[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (expr, opt, method) that produce coeff = 1 and a single polynomial factor Poly(cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ') with exponent 1.

- The function iterates over multiplicative args of expr. To yield the single factor Poly(cos(phi), ...), expr should be cos(phi) (so Mul.make_args(expr) -> (cos(phi),)).
- For base = cos(phi), _poly_from_expr(base, opt) must succeed and produce a Poly whose generator is cos(phi). That requires opt to provide gens containing cos(phi) (so the Poly is constructed in the variable cos(phi) and domain 'ZZ').
- The function calls getattr(poly, method + '_list') and then func(). To get the returned factor list [(Poly(cos(phi)), 1)] we can use method = "factor" (so poly.factor_list() returns (1, [(Poly(cos(phi)),1)])).

Therefore plausible inputs are:
- expr = cos(phi)
- opt with gens = [cos(phi)], expand = False (others optional)
- method = "factor"

This matches the output (coeff 1 and the single Poly factor).
