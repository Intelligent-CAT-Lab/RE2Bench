We need to find inputs (self, rows, cols) for SDM.extract that produce a returned SDM whose dict representation is:
{ "0": {"0": 1}, "1": {"0": 1}, "2": {"0": 1} }.

Inspecting extract:
- The returned SDM is built from sdm2 and has shape (len(rows), len(cols)).
  The output has three top-level rows (0,1,2) and one column (0) => len(rows)=3, len(cols)=1.
- sdm2 keys are output row indices (i2) built from rowmap entries; col keys are output column indices (j2) coming from colmap.
- To get values 1 at each output (i2,j2=0), the original SDM (self) must have nonzero entries in some original rows and a column that intersects the requested cols and has value 1.
- The simplest consistent original SDM is one whose elemsdict already is {0:{0:1}, 1:{0:1}, 2:{0:1}} with shape (3,1). If we call extract with rows=[0,1,2] and cols=[0], then:
  - rowmap maps original rows 0,1,2 to output indices 0,1,2 respectively,
  - colmap maps original column 0 to output column 0,
  - intersections produce sdm2 exactly {0:{0:1}, 1:{0:1}, 2:{0:1}},
  - returned shape is (3,1).
So the inputs are self = SDM with elemsdict {0:{0:1},1:{0:1},2:{0:1}}, shape (3,1), domain (can be any; use "QQ" as a placeholder), rows=[0,1,2], cols=[0].
