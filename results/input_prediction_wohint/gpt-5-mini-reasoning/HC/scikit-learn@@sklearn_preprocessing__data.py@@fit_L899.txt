[THOUGHT]
The fit method returns self (it calls self.partial_fit(...) and returns that). The observed output "StandardScaler()" therefore indicates fit returned the estimator instance with default representation — i.e., a StandardScaler object was passed in as self and returned.

To be a valid call to fit, provide:
- self: a StandardScaler instance with the default __init__ parameters (copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True). Any existing fitted attributes would be cleared by _reset; it's simplest to assume none exist (fresh estimator).
- X: a 2D numeric array (e.g., a small float ndarray) so partial_fit can run without errors.
- y and sample_weight: omitted or null (default None).

I'll choose a minimal valid numeric 2x2 array for X and leave y and sample_weight as null. This will make fit return the estimator instance, matching the output.
