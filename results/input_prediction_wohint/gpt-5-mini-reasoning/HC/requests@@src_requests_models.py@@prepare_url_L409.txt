[THOUGHT]
We need an input that allows PreparedRequest.prepare_url to run to completion and return None (implicit return). The method:

- Accepts url and params.
- Converts bytes to str if needed; otherwise uses str(url).
- Strips leading whitespace.
- If ':' in url and not url.lower().startswith('http') it would set self.url = url and return early — we don't want that; using an http(s) URL avoids the early return.
- Calls parse_url(url) which must succeed and return scheme and host; so provide a valid URL with scheme and host (e.g., "http://example.com").
- Ensures scheme and host are present and host is ASCII; "example.com" is ASCII and valid.
- Builds netloc from auth, host, and optional port.
- Ensures path is non-empty (defaults to '/').
- Converts params when needed: if params is a dict/list it will be encoded by _encode_params into a query string. Using a simple dict like {"a": "b"} yields "a=b".
- Finally it constructs the full URL, requotes it, assigns it to self.url, and the function ends with no return (None).

Therefore a minimal valid input: self as a PreparedRequest-like object with initial attributes from __init__ (method, url, headers, _cookies, body, hooks, _body_position) and args: url = "http://example.com", params = {"a": "b"}. This will cause prepare_url to set self.url (e.g., "http://example.com/?a=b") and return None.
