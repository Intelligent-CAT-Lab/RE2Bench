[THOUGHT]
The __init_subclass__ hook is invoked with the subclass as the single argument cls and returns None (null). To execute the shown code paths (the helper functions listed were called), the subclass must meet two conditions:

- cls.draw initially does NOT have the attribute _supports_rasterization, so the code wraps it with _prevent_rasterization (thus _prevent_rasterization is called).
- cls.set must already have the attribute _autogenerated_signature (so the code does NOT return early) and the method proceeds to replace cls.set with a lambda, adjust names, and call _update_set_signature_and_docstring.

So the input is a subclass object with:
- __qualname__ (e.g., "MyArtist"),
- a draw callable without _supports_rasterization,
- a set callable that already has _autogenerated_signature = true.

The function returns None, matching the given output.
