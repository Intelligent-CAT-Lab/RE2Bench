[THOUGHT]
We need the function to return a 2-tuple whose second element is null (None). The function returns (domain, result) at the end, so result must be None. The only place result can become None in the normal return path is when the algebraic branch is taken and _construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt) returns (domain, None). To force the algebraic branch:

- opt.extension must be True so is_algebraic = lambda coeff: coeff.is_number and coeff.is_algebraic
- At least one coeff must be an algebraic SymPy number (e.g. sqrt(2)); that makes algebraics = True and avoids earlier returns (not a float/complex mix).

Thus a plausible input is coeffs = [sqrt(2)] (a SymPy algebraic number) and opt with extension = True. The function will call _construct_algebraic and (as reflected by the observed output) that call returns a domain object (serialized as {}) and result None, producing the observed output [ {}, null ].
