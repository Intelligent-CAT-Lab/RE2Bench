[THOUGHT]
I need to infer the arguments passed to make_blobs that produced the given X (array of 50 2D points) and y (50 labels 0/1/2).

1. Counted labels in y: there are 50 labels total, with counts [17, 17, 16]. That matches make_blobs behavior for n_samples=50 and centers=3 (50//3 = 16 and remainder 2 → first two centers get +1 sample). So n_samples was 50 and there were 3 centers (so either centers=None with default centers=3 or centers explicitly provided as a 3x2 array). n_features is 2 (points are 2D).

2. I paired each X row (in printed order) with its corresponding y label (same index). I computed per-label sample means:
   - label 0 mean ≈ (0.03, 0.003) — close to (0, 0)
   - label 1 mean ≈ (0.876, 0.991) — close to (1, 1)
   - label 2 mean ≈ (0.034, 1.124) — close to (0, 1)

   These cluster means strongly suggest the caller specified centers corresponding to roughly (0,0), (1,1), (0,1) in label order 0,1,2. That matches a common choice: centers = [[0,0], [1,1], [0,1]].

3. From the spread of each cluster (estimated std ≈ 0.14–0.2), the cluster_std used was smaller than the default 1.0. A typical value used in examples that matches this spread is cluster_std=0.2.

4. A fixed random_state must have been used to make the exact numeric values reproducible. Many examples use random_state=0; with centers explicitly provided and random_state set, the output is deterministic. Using random_state=0 (an integer) is the most likely choice.

5. shuffle was True by default (and the output shows the points were shuffled relative to grouped-by-center order), so keep shuffle=True.

6. center_box is irrelevant when centers are explicitly provided; include the default tuple if desired, but it's not used.

Conclusion: the most plausible input that produced the given output is:
- n_samples = 50
- n_features = 2
- centers = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]
- cluster_std = 0.2
- shuffle = True
- random_state = 0

I'll return these inputs in JSON form.
