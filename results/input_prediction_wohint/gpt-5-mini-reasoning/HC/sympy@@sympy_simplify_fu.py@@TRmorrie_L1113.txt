[THOUGHT]
We need an input rv such that TRmorrie(rv) returns cos(phi).

TRmorrie applies bottom_up with function f that only changes expressions when rv.is_Mul is True; otherwise f returns the node unchanged.

If the input rv is cos(phi):
- bottom_up traverses to the atom phi (unchanged),
- reconstructs cos(phi) (same),
- applies f to cos(phi), but cos(phi).is_Mul is False, so f returns cos(phi).

Therefore the simplest input that yields the output "cos(phi)" is rv = cos(phi) (with phi a SymPy Symbol).
