[THOUGHT]
We are given the function _nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop and its output (x_weights, y_weights, ite). I need to propose input X and Y (and optional params if non-default) that are consistent with the output.

1. Shapes:
   - The returned x_weights is 3x1, so X must have 3 columns (X.shape[1] == 3).
   - The returned y_weights is 2x1, so Y must have 2 columns (Y.shape[1] == 2).
   - Both X and Y must have the same number of rows (n_samples). Since x_weights has length 3 but that is number of features, choose n_samples = 3 and X.shape = (3,3), Y.shape = (3,2). This is the simplest consistent choice.

2. Strategy to produce the given outputs:
   - If I pick X = I (3x3 identity) then x_score = X @ x_weights ends up equal to x_weights, which simplifies the fixed-point equations.
   - For a given x_weights and x_score = x_weights (norm 1), to obtain the given y_weights we need Y.T @ x_score = y_weights (since denominator x_score.T x_score = 1). So choose Y columns proportional to x_weights such that their dot-products with x_weights equal the desired y_weights components.
   - A simple choice meeting that requirement is to set the two columns of Y to be the target y_weights components multiplied by x_weights:
       col0 = y_weights[0] * x_weights
       col1 = y_weights[1] * x_weights
     Then Y.T @ x_weights = [col0.T x_weights, col1.T x_weights] = [y_weights[0], y_weights[1]] because x_weights.T x_weights = 1.

3. With these choices (X = identity, Y columns = scale * x_weights), the NIPALS fixed-point updates keep x_weights aligned with the initial y_score direction and produce the desired y_weights. The function's iteration count depends on tiny numerical factors; with the chosen construction the algorithm converges in a few iterations (the provided output shows ite = 3).

4. Therefore a consistent input is:
   - X = 3x3 identity (dtype float)
   - Y = 3x2 matrix whose columns are the given y_weights scalars times the given x_weights vector
   - Use default values for mode, max_iter, tol, norm_y_weights.

I supply the numeric arrays (floating-point) constructed as described below.
