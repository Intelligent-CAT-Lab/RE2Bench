[THOUGHT]
We need self.mul(other) to return Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})).

mul computes:
- coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff
- numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)
- denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)
- then numer, denom = numer.normal(denom)
- returns Term(coeff, numer, denom)

To get coeff == 1, a simple choice is self.coeff == 1 and other.coeff == 1.
To get numer and denom both empty Factors after normalization, the simplest possibility is that both self.numer and other.numer are empty Factors and both self.denom and other.denom are empty Factors. Then mul of numer and denom yields empty Factors, and normal(empty, empty) => (empty, empty).

So both operands can be Term objects with coeff 1 and empty Factors for numer and denom.
