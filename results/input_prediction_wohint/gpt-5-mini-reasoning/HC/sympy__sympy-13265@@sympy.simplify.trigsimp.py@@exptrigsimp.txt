[THOUGHT]
We need an input to exptrigsimp that would produce an output object whose serialized form shows a "nargs" attribute with _elements equal to frozenset({1}) — i.e. nargs is a FiniteSet({1}).

In SymPy, FunctionClass objects for unary functions (like sin, cos, tan, etc.) have nargs = FiniteSet(1), which internally is represented with an _elements frozenset({1}). If exptrigsimp receives such a FunctionClass (for example the sin class) and nothing in the function changes it (bottom_up will return the object unchanged for non-Basic/non-expression objects), the returned object would be the FunctionClass itself, whose serialized form includes nargs -> {_elements: frozenset({1})}.

Therefore a minimal plausible input is the sin function class from sympy.functions (or any unary FunctionClass). I'll pick sin.
