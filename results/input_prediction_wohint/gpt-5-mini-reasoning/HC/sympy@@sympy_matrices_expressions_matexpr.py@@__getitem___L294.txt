[THOUGHT]
1. The output "X[1, 2]" is the string form of a matrix element access like MatrixElement(X, 1, 2). That is produced when __getitem__ receives a 2-tuple of indices and returns self._entry(i, j), whose string form is "X[1, 2]".
2. __getitem__ treats a tuple key of length 2 as the (i, j) indices branch (not slices). It sympifies the indices but Python ints are allowed, so the key must have been (1, 2) (or equivalent integers).
3. The receiver self must be a MatrixExpr-like object named "X" (so that the returned element prints as "X[1, 2]"). Its shape can be unknown (None) so index validity is not ruled out.
4. Therefore the call was __getitem__(self=<MatrixExpr named "X">, key=(1, 2)).
