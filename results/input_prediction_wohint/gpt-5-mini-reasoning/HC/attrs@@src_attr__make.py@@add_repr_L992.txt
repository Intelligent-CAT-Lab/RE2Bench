[THOUGHT]
1. add_repr(self, ns) calls _make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns). The generated __repr__ is built from the list of attribute metadata in self._attrs.
2. The observed output "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>" indicates the generated repr included a single attribute named "cls" whose representation produced the bare token "Concrete" (not the default Python repr). That implies the attribute metadata for "cls" used a custom repr callable (not the default repr).
3. When ns is None, the class-name fragment in the generated repr uses self.__class__.__qualname__, which for this object is "_ClassBuilder", producing a string like "_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)". (The angle brackets in the observed output are just framing in the output.)
4. add_repr appends the generated script/globs/attach-function tuple into self._script_snippets, sets self._repr_added = True and returns self.
5. Therefore the minimal input that would lead to the shown output is:
   - self._attrs containing one attribute metadata with name "cls", repr set to a custom callable, and init True
   - ns set to null (None)
   - self initially with _repr_added False and an empty _script_snippets list
