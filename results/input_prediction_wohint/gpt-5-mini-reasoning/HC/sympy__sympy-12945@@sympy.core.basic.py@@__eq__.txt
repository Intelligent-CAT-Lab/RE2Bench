[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to Basic.__eq__ that make it return True.

Reading the method:
- It first returns True if self is other (identity).
- Otherwise it goes through type checks and may return True if the two objects have the same _hashable_content() (i.e. same _args) after possible sympification and type matching.

The simplest guaranteed way to get True is to have other be exactly the same object as self (self is other). So the input is a Basic instance (with its expected attributes) used as both self and other. I'll represent the Basic instance with the typical slots: _mhash (null), _args (an empty tuple/list), and _assumptions (null). Both self and other will be that same object (represented identically here).
