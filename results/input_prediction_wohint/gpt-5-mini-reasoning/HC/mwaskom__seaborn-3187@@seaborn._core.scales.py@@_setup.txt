[THOUGHT]
We are given the final state of a ContinuousBase instance after running _setup. The method copies self, avoids calling tick() or label() if those attributes are already present, obtains a transform/scale (here "log"), does not set a legend (prop.legend must be False), and leaves norm/values unchanged (null). The _matplotlib_scale._transform details indicate the transform produced was a log-type transform.

To produce that final state, I assume:
- self had the listed attributes before the call (values and norm None, trans "log", non-None _tick_params and _label_params, _legend None).
- prop had normed False and legend False and a get_mapping that effectively yields no mapping (so pipeline elements serialize as null).
- data is a pandas.Series-like object with name null.
- axis was not passed (None), so _setup will create an axis internally.

I therefore supply "self" with the shown attributes, and arguments data, prop, axis matching the conditions above.
