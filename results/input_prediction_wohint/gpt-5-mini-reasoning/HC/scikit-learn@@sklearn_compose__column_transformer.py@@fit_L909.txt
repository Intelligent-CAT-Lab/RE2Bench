[THOUGHT]
We need the inputs to ColumnTransformer.fit that would produce the returned value shown:
{"output": "ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('trans', Trans(), 0)])"}

ColumnTransformer.fit returns self after calling fit_transform. So the returned self must have transformers equal to [('trans', Trans(), 0)]. Therefore the input "self" must already have that transformers attribute.

fit first calls _raise_for_params(params, self, 'fit'). That will raise unless metadata routing is enabled or no extra params are passed. So call must pass no extra keyword params (empty params).

To avoid other immediate errors, provide a simple valid 2D X (e.g. a small 2D list/array). y can be omitted (None).

We'll represent the transformer instance as "Trans()" (consistent with the output string). Other ColumnTransformer init attributes can be left at defaults but including them isn't necessary; include the key ones for clarity.

So the input JSON will contain:
- self with transformers = [('trans', Trans(), 0)] (Trans represented as "Trans()")
- args containing X (simple 2D array)
- no kwargs (empty)
