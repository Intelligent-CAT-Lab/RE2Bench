[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that, when passed to delete_parameter, produce a function object whose repr is "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2 at 0x71b974693560>".

delete_parameter returns a wrapper function (decorator) when called with func not None. The wrapper is created with functools.wraps(func), so the returned wrapper will have the same __name__ and qualname as the original function (here "test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2"), and its repr will look like "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2 at 0x...>".

Therefore the call must have provided a func object named "func2" defined in the local scope of test_delete_parameter. The values of the other parameters (since, name, optional kwargs) don't affect the fact that a wrapper function is returned; they can be any valid values. I'll pick a plausible since string and a parameter name, and no extra kwargs.

So the input is:
- since: "3.0"
- name: "param"
- func: the function object represented as "<function test_delete_parameter.<locals>.func2 at 0x71b974693560>"
- kwargs: {}
