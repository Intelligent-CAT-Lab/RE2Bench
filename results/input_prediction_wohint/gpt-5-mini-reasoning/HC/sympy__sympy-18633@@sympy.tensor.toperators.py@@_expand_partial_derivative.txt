[THOUGHT]
We need a self such that _expand_partial_derivative produces an object whose _indices, _free, and _dum are null. The method sets these three attributes from the return of _contract_indices_for_derivative, then immediately returns S.Zero if the expression has no free_symbols. The simplest way to get the "no free symbols" branch is to have expr be a pure Number (e.g. 1) and have no variables. That leads the function to construct args with a single numeric expr, set obj._indices/_free/_dum from the contraction call (which will be empty/None-like), then return S.Zero.

So provide a PartialDerivative-like self with:
- _args (Basic._args) a single numeric expression (1),
- no variables (so variables = ()),
- initial attribute placeholders for _indices, _free, _dum as null.

No extra args/kwargs are needed.
