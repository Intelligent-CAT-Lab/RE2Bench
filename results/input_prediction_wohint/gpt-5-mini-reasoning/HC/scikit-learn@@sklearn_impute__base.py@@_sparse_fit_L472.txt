[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to _sparse_fit(self, X, strategy, missing_values, fill_value) that produce statistics array([3., 2., 5., nan, 2.5]).

Examine the code path for the 'mean' strategy (simplest):
- For each column i, it forms column = stored non-missing entries, removes explicit zeros, computes n_zeros = n_implicit_zeros[i] + n_explicit_zeros, then s = column.size + n_zeros and statistics[i] = column.sum() / s (or nan if s==0).
- To get nan for the 4th feature, make both stored entries missing and ensure n_zeros == 0 so s == 0 -> nan.
- To get 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.5 for other columns, choose stored non-missing non-zero entries whose average equals these numbers given no implicit/explicit zeros.

Choose a small CSC sparse matrix with shape (2, 5) (2 rows, 5 columns). Use indptr so each column stores both entries (no implicit zeros): indptr diff = [2,2,2,2,2] => indptr = [0,2,4,6,8,10]. Data is concatenation of per-column stored values:
- Column 0: [1,5] -> mean 3.0
- Column 1: [1,3] -> mean 2.0
- Column 2: [4,6] -> mean 5.0
- Column 3: [0,0] -> mark these as missing so they get removed -> s==0 -> nan
- Column 4: [2,3] -> mean 2.5

To make column 3 entries treated as missing, set missing_values = 0. Then _get_mask will mark the two zeros in column 3 as missing (mask True) and they will be removed before mean computation. There are no implicit zeros and no explicit zeros remaining in other columns, so the computed means match the target.

Set self.keep_empty_features = False and self.add_indicator = False to avoid indicator fitting side-effects. Use strategy = "mean". Set fill_value = null.

Therefore input encodes a CSC sparse-like object with data, indptr, shape, and missing_values = 0 producing the given output.
