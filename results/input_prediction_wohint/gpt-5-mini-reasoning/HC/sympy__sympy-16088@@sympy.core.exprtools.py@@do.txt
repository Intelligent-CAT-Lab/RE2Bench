We need the value passed into the inner function do. factor_terms does expr = sympify(expr) and then returns do(expr). The reported output string is "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2", which indicates the expression uses a floating coefficient 0.0644444444444444 (i.e. a Float multiplied by pi) inside sin, squared.

Therefore do would be called with the sympified form of that expression. The simplest and most direct input that leads to that printed form is the expression using the float 0.0644444444444444, i.e. sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2. do receives that sympy expression (a Basic/Expr instance), but representing it in the JSON input as the corresponding expression string is appropriate.

So the input to do is the expression: sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2
