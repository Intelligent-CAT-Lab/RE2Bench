[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs that cause simple_tag to return an object that serializes to {} (the provided output). Looking at simple_tag:

- If func is None, simple_tag returns the decorator function dec — that would be a function object, not {}.
- If func is callable, simple_tag calls dec(func) and dec registers a compile_func in self.tags and then returns func (the original function object).

Therefore the only way simple_tag returns a function object (which can serialize as an empty JSON object {}) is to be called with a callable func. takes_context and name default to None, and self must be a Library instance (with filters and tags dicts). The decorator will register the tag under the function's name in self.tags, but the returned value is the original function, which matches the {} output.

So the input: self is a Library-like object with empty filters/tags, func is a callable (represented here as an empty object), and no kwargs.
