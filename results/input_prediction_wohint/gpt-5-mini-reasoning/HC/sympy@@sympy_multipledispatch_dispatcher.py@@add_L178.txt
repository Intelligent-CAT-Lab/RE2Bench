[THOUGHT]
We need the inputs passed to Dispatcher.add that produced a null return (i.e., completed without raising and without returning a value).

The add method behavior:
- If signature is falsy, it tries to extract annotations from func; not needed if we provide a signature.
- If any item in signature is a tuple, it expands union types via expand_tuples; to keep it simple, pick a plain signature with types (no nested tuples).
- It checks every typ in signature is a type; with (int, int) that's satisfied.
- It stores the function under self.funcs[signature], calls self.reorder(...), clears the cache, and returns None.

A canonical, minimal example matching the method doc and the observed successful outcome is adding a binary int handler:
- self is a Dispatcher instance with empty funcs and cache
- signature is (int, int)
- func is a simple callable, e.g. lambda x, y: x + y
- on_ambiguity omitted (default)

I'll express the types and function as simple JSON-friendly representations, and include the dispatcher's minimal fields that the method uses (name, funcs, ordering, _cache, doc). The call returns None, so output null matches this input.
