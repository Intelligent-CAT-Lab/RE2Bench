[THOUGHT]
The function searches for '(' characters (unnamed groups) and, if any are found, replaces each group with '<var>' in the returned string. If no '(' is present, group_start_end_indices will be empty and the function returns the original pattern unchanged.

The output "^a/?$" contains no '(' characters, so the simplest and expected input is the same string: "^a/?$". Calling replace_unnamed_groups("^a/?$") would find no groups and return the pattern unchanged.
