[THOUGHT]
1. The result is a 2x4 matrix:
   [[1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1]]
2. row_join concatenates two matrices horizontally. Both inputs must have 2 rows, and their column counts must add to 4.
3. Splitting the result into the left and right halves (first 2 columns and last 2 columns) gives:
   left = [[1,0],[0,1]]
   right = [[1,0],[0,1]]
4. Therefore self and other are both the 2x2 identity matrix.

```
{
  "self": [[1, 0], [0, 1]],
  "other": [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
}
