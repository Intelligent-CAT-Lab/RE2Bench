[THOUGHT]
We need an input expression that, when passed to kahane_simplify, yields the returned TensMul-like object shown. Inspecting kahane_simplify:

- It handles Mul, TensAdd, Tensor, and otherwise expects a TensMul (assert).
- Early in the function it builds dum = [(pos, pos2) ...] by filtering expression.dum for LorentzIndex. If len(dum) == 0 the function returns expression unchanged.

The output shows _ext_rank = 2 and _rank = 2, with no dummy contractions (dum appears null/empty in the JSON). That corresponds to a TensMul with two free indices and zero dummy contractions. The simplest such TensMul is the product of two GammaMatrix tensors, each carrying one LorentzIndex (two free indices total). In that case len(dum) == 0 so kahane_simplify returns the input expression unchanged — matching the returned object structure.

Thus the input is a TensMul formed by two GammaMatrix tensors with distinct free indices, e.g. GammaMatrix('i0') * GammaMatrix('i1').
