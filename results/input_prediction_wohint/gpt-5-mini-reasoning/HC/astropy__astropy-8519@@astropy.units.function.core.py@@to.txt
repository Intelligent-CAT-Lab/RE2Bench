[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to FunctionUnitBase.to(...) that produce the return value 100.0.

Look at the code paths:

- If other is self.physical_unit: it returns self.to_physical(value). The simplest way to get 100.0 is to make other be the same object as self.physical_unit and choose value so that self.to_physical(value) yields 100.0. The typical minimal assumption used in these puzzles is that to_physical is identity (i.e., returns the numeric value passed in). Under that assumption, setting value=100.0 and other equal to self.physical_unit will make the function return 100.0 immediately.

I will therefore pick:
- self.physical_unit set to a unit placeholder "unitA"
- other set to that same "unitA" (so the "is" test succeeds)
- value = 100.0
- equivalencies left as empty list

This yields the function returning self.to_physical(100.0) → 100.0 under the identity-to_physical assumption.
