[THOUGHT]
- The function returns (expr, {}, []) when expr.is_commutative is True (early return).
- The observed output expr string is "2 - 2*cos(phi)" and the returned mapping and nc_syms are empty, so the early return must have happened.
- Therefore the input eq must be a commutative SymPy expression equal to 2 - 2*cos(phi). The optional name argument was not needed (defaults to "mask"), so it's omitted / null.
- Represent phi as a SymPy symbol; eq = 2 - 2*cos(phi).
