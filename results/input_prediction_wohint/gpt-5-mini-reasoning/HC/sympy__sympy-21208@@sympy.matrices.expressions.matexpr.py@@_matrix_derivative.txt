[THOUGHT]
1. _matrix_derivative(expr, x) calls expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x) (via Expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines).
2. Expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines builds a _LeftRightArgs with higher = self._eval_derivative(x). So the "higher" entry in the built parts is exactly the result of expr._eval_derivative(x).
3. The provided object (with "_rows": 2, "_cols": 2, "_mat": null) is the matrix that must have been returned by expr._eval_derivative(x).
4. Therefore the simplest input that leads to that is:
   - expr: an object whose _eval_derivative(x) returns the given 2x2 matrix (represented here by its internal fields),
   - x: the differentiation variable (can be a symbol name).
5. I'll represent expr as an object with an _eval_derivative method/result set to the given matrix, and x as the symbol "x".
