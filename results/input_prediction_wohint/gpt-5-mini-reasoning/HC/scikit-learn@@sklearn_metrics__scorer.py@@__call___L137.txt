[THOUGHT]
We need an input to _MultimetricScorer.__call__ that leads to the returned dict {"score": -Infinity}.

1. __call__ builds routed_params differently depending on _routing_enabled(). Default is False, so routed_params will be a Bunch for each name in self._scorers whose .score is common_kwargs (kwargs excluding 'sample_weight').
2. To get only one key "score" in the returned dict, self._scorers should contain a single entry with key "score".
3. The value associated with that key can be either a callable (not an instance of _BaseScorer) or a _BaseScorer instance whose computed score is -Infinity. Simpler: make it a callable that, when invoked as scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score), returns float("-inf").
4. Use no kwargs (so routed_params.score == {}), and no extra args. __call__ will therefore call scorer(estimator) and assign its return to scores["score"].
5. _raise_exc can be True (default); no exception should be raised because the scorer returns -Infinity successfully.

Thus the input: self with _scorers = {"score": callable_that_returns_-Infinity}, _raise_exc true; call __call__ with a placeholder estimator and no extra args or kwargs.

(We represent the callable abstractly as "callable_returning_-Infinity" since JSON cannot encode arbitrary callables.)
