We need inputs such that match_submerged_margins returns a list of two Axes objects (shown as "<Axes: >", "<Axes: >").

Walkthrough of the function:
- It first recurses over fig.subfigs; keep fig.subfigs empty so axsdone stays [].
- It builds axs from fig.get_axes() filtered by:
  - a.get_subplotspec() is not None,
  - a.get_in_layout() is True,
  - a not in axsdone.
  To get two returned axes, provide fig.get_axes() with two axes that satisfy these conditions.
- For each axis, it checks ss1.get_gridspec() in layoutgrids. To avoid removal, ensure the gridspec returned is present as a key in layoutgrids.
- The function only modifies margins when colspan or rowspan length > 1. To avoid needing margin values and edits, give each SubplotSpec colspan and rowspan of length 1 so those branches are skipped.
- With these conditions, the function will simply return the two axis objects provided by fig.get_axes().

So inputs:
- layoutgrids: mapping containing the gridspec key used by the axes (e.g., "gs1").
- fig: object with subfigs = [] and get_axes returning two axis-like objects. Each axis has:
  - get_subplotspec() returning an object whose get_gridspec() returns "gs1" and whose colspan and rowspan are length-1 ranges/lists,
  - get_in_layout() returning True.
Represent the axes by simple dict-like structures; their printable representation is "<Axes: >" as in the output.
