[THOUGHT]
1. as_ordered_factors calls cpart, ncpart = self.args_cnc().
   - args_cnc returns [c, nc] where c is the contiguous prefix of commutative factors and nc the remainder.
2. as_ordered_factors sorts cpart by each expr.sort_key(order=order) and then returns cpart + ncpart.
3. The final output is ["w", "z"]. The simplest way to obtain that is:
   - args_cnc returns cpart = ["w", "z"] and ncpart = [] (i.e., both factors are commutative and already orderable).
   - Sorting cpart with the given (or default None) order yields ["w", "z"].
4. Therefore the input Mul instance should have args equal to ("w", "z") (both commutative), and the method is called with no order argument (order defaults to None).
