[THOUGHT]
We have a FeatureUnion instance whose public attributes are given:
{
  "transformer_list": null,
  "n_jobs": null,
  "transformer_weights": null,
  "verbose": false
}

The question asks for the input of fit. The fit method signature is fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params). To call fit we must provide self (the FeatureUnion instance) and at least X. The shown attributes match what __init__ sets, so I'll represent self with those attribute values.

For X I choose a minimal numeric 2D array (one sample, two features) [[0, 0]] so downstream validators that expect a 2D numeric array with at least 1 sample and some features will accept it. y will be null (None). No extra kwargs.

Thus the predicted call inputs are self (the FeatureUnion object described) and args X = [[0, 0]], y = null.
