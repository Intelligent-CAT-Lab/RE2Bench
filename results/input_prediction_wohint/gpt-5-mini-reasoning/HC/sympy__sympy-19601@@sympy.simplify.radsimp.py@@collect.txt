[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to collect(...) that produce the sympy object whose string representation is "_Dummy_373".

- If expr is a single (Dummy) symbol and syms contains that same symbol, collect will find a single collected key equal to that symbol with coefficient 1.
- With evaluate=True the function returns Add(*[key * val for key,val in collected.items()]). If there's a single key which is the symbol and its value is 1, Add(symbol) evaluates to the symbol itself.
- Therefore passing expr equal to a Dummy symbol named "_Dummy_373" and syms containing that same symbol (and evaluate=True) will make collect return that Dummy whose printed name is "_Dummy_373".

So the input will set expr to "_Dummy_373", syms to ["_Dummy_373"], and set evaluate to true (other optional args left at their defaults / sensible values).
