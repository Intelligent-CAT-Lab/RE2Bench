[THOUGHT]
We need an input to Printer._print that yields the string "phi".

Look at Printer._print:
- It first checks self.printmethod; default is None, so that branch is skipped.
- It then builds classes = type(expr).__mro__ and searches for a method _print_<ClassName> on self. If none is found, it calls self.emptyPrinter(expr).
- Printer.emptyPrinter simply returns str(expr).

Therefore the simplest way for _print to return "phi" is to pass an expr whose str(expr) == "phi" and for which no special _print_<ClassName> method on self is found. The easiest such expr is the Python string "phi" (type str). Printer typically has no _print_str method, so emptyPrinter will be used and will return "phi".

So the predicted input: self is a Printer-like object with default attributes (printmethod None, etc.), expr is the string "phi", no kwargs.
