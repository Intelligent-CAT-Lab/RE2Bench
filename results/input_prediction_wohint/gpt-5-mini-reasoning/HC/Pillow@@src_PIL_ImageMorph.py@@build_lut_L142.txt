- build_default_lut() creates a 512-entry LUT (9-bit patterns). It sets each entry to 1 if bit 4 (value 16) is set in the index, otherwise 0, so initially half (256) of entries are 1.
- build_lut() then compiles patterns from self.patterns and applies them in order; later patterns can override earlier ones.
- To get the final LUT shown (all zeros except a single final 1 at index 511), a simple sequence is:
  1. A pattern that matches every 9-bit pattern and sets result 0 (e.g. "1:(... ... ...)->0"). That will set all entries to 0 (overriding the default ones).
  2. A pattern that matches only the all-ones bitpattern "111111111" and sets it to 1, e.g. "(111111111)->1".
- With self.patterns = ["1:(... ... ...)->0", "(111111111)->1"] and self.lut = None, build_lut() will return a bytearray with only the last entry (index 511) equal to 1, matching the provided output.
