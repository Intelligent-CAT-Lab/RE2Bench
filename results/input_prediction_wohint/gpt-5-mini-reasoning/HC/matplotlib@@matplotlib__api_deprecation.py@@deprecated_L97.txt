[THOUGHT]
The function deprecated(...) returns the inner function deprecate, regardless of the optional keyword arguments, as long as the required positional argument since is provided. The returned value in the output is just the function object "<function deprecated.<locals>.deprecate ...>", which is exactly what deprecated(...) yields.

Therefore the simplest input is to call deprecated with a since string and leave all other keyword arguments as their defaults. I'll pick a typical version string "2.0" for the required since parameter and keep the rest default.
