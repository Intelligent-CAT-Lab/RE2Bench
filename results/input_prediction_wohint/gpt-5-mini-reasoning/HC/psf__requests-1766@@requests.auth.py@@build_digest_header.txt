[THOUGHT]
We need to infer the state of the HTTPDigestAuth instance and the method/url passed to build_digest_header that produce the given Digest header.

From the header:
- username is "user" -> self.username == "user"
- realm is "me@kennethreitz.com" -> chal['realm'] == "me@kennethreitz.com"
- nonce is "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899" -> chal['nonce'] set to that
- uri is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" -> the URL passed must have that path (e.g. "http://.../digest-auth/auth/user/pass")
- response value shown corresponds to MD5-based digest with qop="auth" and nc=00000001 -> chal['qop'] == "auth", and this must be the first use of this nonce (so self.last_nonce != nonce and self.nonce_count becomes 1)
- algorithm appears in output as "MD5" -> chal['algorithm'] should be "MD5" so the header includes algorithm="MD5"
- opaque present -> chal['opaque'] matches given value
- cnonce is present (generated internally) -> deterministic generation depends on time and os.urandom; we only need to ensure nonce_count/last_nonce state leads to nc=00000001 and a cnonce being generated

Password must be the one used to compute HA1; header username is "user" and typical example uses "pass", so set self.password = "pass".

Therefore plausible inputs:
- self.username = "user"
- self.password = "pass"
- self.last_nonce = "" (different from the chal nonce so nonce_count resets to 1)
- self.nonce_count = 0 (so it becomes 1)
- self.chal containing realm, nonce, qop, opaque, algorithm as in the header
- method = "GET" and url with path "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (e.g. "http://kennethreitz.com/digest-auth/auth/user/pass")

We don't need to reproduce the internal cnonce exact randomness; specifying the chal and method/url as above matches the provided header fields.
