[THOUGHT]
The inner function f returns its argument unchanged if it's not an instance of TrigonometricFunction:
    if not isinstance(rv, TrigonometricFunction):
        return rv

The given output "_Dummy_163*x" is a simple product (a Mul), not a TrigonometricFunction, so f must have returned rv directly. Therefore the input rv was the same expression "_Dummy_163*x".
