[THOUGHT]
The JSON output contains the string "1/(y*\"tanh(x)\")". The escaped quotes are just JSON escaping, so the actual SymPy expression printed is 1/(y*tanh(x)). The simplest input to simplify that would produce this output is the same expression 1/(y*tanh(x)). The other parameters (ratio, measure, rational) have defaults, so only expr needs to be provided.
