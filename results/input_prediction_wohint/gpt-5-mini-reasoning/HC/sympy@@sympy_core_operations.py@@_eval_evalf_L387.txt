[THOUGHT]
We need an input to a _eval_evalf(self, prec) call that would produce the string "-0.e-1" as output.

Looking at the provided functions:
- sympy.core.numbers._eval_evalf simply returns self.
- SymPy Float objects format negative zero with a precision-based scientific notation; a Float representing negative zero with a small precision (e.g. prec=1) will render as "-0.e-1".

Therefore, the simplest input that yields the given output is calling _eval_evalf on a Float object representing -0.0 with prec=1. So provide "self" as a Float with value -0.0 and include the positional argument prec = 1.

I'll format the input similar to the example (include self, args, kwargs).
