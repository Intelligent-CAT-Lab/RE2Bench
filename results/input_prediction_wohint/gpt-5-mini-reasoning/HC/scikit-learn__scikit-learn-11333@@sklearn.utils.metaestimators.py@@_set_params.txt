We need to determine how _set_params was called to produce the given parameter mapping. The method signature is _set_params(self, attr, **params).

- The provided mapping lists top-level parameter names for a ColumnTransformer-like object: "transformers", "remainder", "n_jobs", "transformer_weights". Those are the keyword parameters that would be passed in as **params.
- In composition classes (ColumnTransformer uses _BaseComposition), _set_params is typically invoked with attr referring to the internal attribute that stores the (name, estimator) pairs (conventionally "_transformers").
- So the call will be _set_params(self, "_transformers", transformers=None, remainder="drop", n_jobs=1, transformer_weights=None).
- For completeness, the instance (self) should have the attribute named by attr (here "_transformers"); an empty list is a minimal, valid value so the function can inspect items and proceed.

Therefore the input is the instance containing _transformers plus the positional attr and the keyword params shown.
