[THOUGHT]
1. The HTML contains "<strong>BiCone</strong>" and many occurrences of "BiCone" in the img alt/title and PNG metadata, so self.name == "BiCone".
2. The outside color block shows title/background "#ff00ffff", which corresponds to RGBA (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0); the bad color block "#00000000" corresponds to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). So self._rgba_outside == (1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0) and self._rgba_bad == (0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0).
3. _repr_html_ calls _repr_png_, which requires the colormap to be initialized (it calls self._init() if not self._isinit). The code produced a PNG, so self._isinit must be True and a _lut array must be present. A small _lut will be repeated/resized by the code, so it's sufficient to provide a minimal numeric _lut.
4. Other attributes (N, M, _shape) can be set to typical/default values consistent with the class; use N=256, M=256, _shape='square'.
5. The method takes only self, so the JSON input contains a single "self" object with these attributes.

(Provide a minimal plausible self state that would lead to the shown HTML.)
