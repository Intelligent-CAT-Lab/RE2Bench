[THOUGHT]
We need a minimal input to ColumnTransformer.transform that would produce the numpy array
array([[0, 2],
       [1, 4],
       [2, 6]])
The simplest explanation is that the transformer just returns the two columns as-is. That can be achieved by:
- X being a 3x2 array equal to the desired output, e.g. [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]].
- self being a fitted ColumnTransformer with two passthrough transformers that select column 0 and column 1 respectively (so the transform will return those two columns unchanged).

To satisfy check_is_fitted and the code paths, include a fitted-like attribute transformers_ and a few flags used in transform (n_jobs, verbose_feature_names_out, sparse_output_). No extra params are passed.

So input: self with transformers_ = [("t1","passthrough",[0]), ("t2","passthrough",[1])] and X = [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]].
