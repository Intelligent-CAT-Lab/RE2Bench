[THOUGHT]
We need X and Y such that euclidean_distances(X, Y, ...) returns a 1x1 matrix [[1.1649954]].

euclidean_distances computes pairwise Euclidean distances: for single-row inputs (1 sample each), the result is [[sqrt(sum((x - y)^2))]]. So we can choose 1x1 arrays so the distance equals the absolute difference of their single entries.

Pick X = [[1.1649954]] and Y = [[0.0]] so the distance is sqrt((1.1649954 - 0)^2) = 1.1649954, matching the output. Use None for optional arguments (Y_norm_squared, X_norm_squared) and squared = false.

Provide the inputs as JSON-compatible values (lists for arrays, null for Nones).
