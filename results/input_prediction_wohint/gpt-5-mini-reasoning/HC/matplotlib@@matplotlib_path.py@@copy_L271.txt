[THOUGHT]
1. The copy() method returns copy.copy(self) — a shallow copy of the Path instance.
2. The observed output string is "Path(array([[0., 0.],\n       [1., 1.]]), array([1, 2], dtype=uint8))", which indicates the Path's vertices are [[0., 0.], [1., 1.]] and its codes are [1, 2] with dtype uint8.
3. To produce that output, the input self must be a Path instance whose _vertices equals the 2x2 float array [[0.,0.],[1.,1.]] and whose _codes equals the uint8 array [1,2]. copy() does not need other attributes, but include reasonable defaults for _interpolation_steps and _readonly.
4. No positional or keyword args are passed to copy().
