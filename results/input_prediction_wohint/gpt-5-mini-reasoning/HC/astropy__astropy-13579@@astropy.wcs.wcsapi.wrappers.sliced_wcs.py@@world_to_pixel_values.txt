[THOUGHT]
We need to infer what inputs to SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values could have produced the reported output: a pair of very small numbers (two floats, near zero). Walkthrough of the method:

- It builds sliced_out_world_coords by calling self._pixel_to_world_values_all with as many zeros as len(self._pixel_keep). If there is no integer indexing in _slices_pixel, this simply yields values used only for world dimensions that are not kept.
- It converts the provided world_arrays into numpy arrays and constructs world_arrays_new by inserting either entries from the user-supplied world_arrays (for indices in _world_keep) or values from sliced_out_world_coords (for indices not in _world_keep).
- It calls self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays_new), and then possibly subtracts slice starts from pixel arrays. The result is then filtered by _pixel_keep and returned.

The output is a 2-tuple of scalar pixel coordinates, so:
- the underlying WCS returned two scalar pixel values (or arrays broadcasting to scalars),
- there was no array broadcasting complexity,
- simplest consistent scenario: the WCS has 2 world dimensions and 2 pixel dimensions, no slicing offsets that would change the numbers, and the user supplied two scalar world coordinates which the WCS mapped to those near-zero pixel values.

The minimal, plausible call that yields such a result is calling world_to_pixel_values with two scalar world coordinates. The simplest choice is (0.0, 0.0) as the world inputs (many WCS setups map the reference world position to near-zero pixel offsets). So we return the input representation with a self having the minimal relevant attributes and the args being two scalar world coordinates (0.0, 0.0).
