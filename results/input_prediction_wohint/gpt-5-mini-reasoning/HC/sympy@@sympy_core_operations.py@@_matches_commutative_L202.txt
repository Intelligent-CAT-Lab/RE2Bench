[THOUGHT]
The simplest way for _matches_commutative to return the exact mapping {"a_": "1", "n_": "1", "m_": "0"} is for the caller to supply that mapping as repl_dict and for the function to hit the early-return case where self == expr (which returns the provided repl_dict). That requires expr to be equal to self and repl_dict to already contain the shown mappings. So the input will set expr equal to self, provide repl_dict with those key/value strings, and leave old as False.
