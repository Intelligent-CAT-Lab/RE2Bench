[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs (self, args, expr) to _EvaluatorPrinter._preprocess that would produce the returned pair whose JSON form is [null, "sin(x)**2"].

Looking at the code:
- It computes dummify from self._dummify or by inspecting args.
- It builds argstrs as a Python list and iterates over each element in args, possibly recursing if an element is itself iterable. Finally it returns (argstrs, expr).
- The returned expr is "sin(x)**2", so the input expr must already be that (or must remain unchanged by any substitutions). That suggests no substitutions occurred, so no Dummy replacements were made.
- The first returned item in JSON is null. The function always returns a list for argstrs in normal execution; the most straightforward way to get an "empty"/no-arguments result is to call with args being an empty sequence, so argstrs == [] on return. (The provided output uses JSON null for the first element; the empty Python list is the natural corresponding input-side value that leads to a "no arguments" argstrs result.)

Thus a simple, consistent input is:
- self._dummify = False (so no dummification),
- args = [] (no arguments → argstrs becomes an empty list),
- expr = "sin(x)**2" (the expression returned unchanged).

I will present these input values in JSON form below.
