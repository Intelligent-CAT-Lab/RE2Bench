[THOUGHT]
1. __contains__ delegates to contains(item), so I need item and a SpecifierSet state (self) that make contains(...) return True.
2. contains does _coerce_version(item). To succeed, pick an item that parses to a non-prerelease Version, e.g. "1.2.3" — _coerce_version("1.2.3") returns a Version with is_prerelease == False.
3. installed is not provided (None), and version.is_prerelease is False, so prereleases remains None.
4. If self._specs is empty, filter goes into the "else" branch: it collects non-prerelease versions into filtered and returns filtered if non-empty. Since our version is non-prerelease, filtered will contain the version and filter will yield it, so bool(list(...)) is True.
5. Therefore, a SpecifierSet with no specifiers (empty _specs) and _prereleases null, and item "1.2.3" will make __contains__ return true.
