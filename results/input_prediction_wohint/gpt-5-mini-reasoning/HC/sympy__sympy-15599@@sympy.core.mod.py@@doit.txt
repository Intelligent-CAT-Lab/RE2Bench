[THOUGHT]
We need values p and q such that doit(p, q) returns S.Zero (printed as "0").

Check the early return conditions in doit:
- If p == S.Zero: return S.Zero. This is the simplest way to get 0, as long as q is not S.Zero (to avoid ZeroDivisionError).
So choose p = 0 and any nonzero q (e.g. 5). This satisfies the condition and yields output 0.
