[THOUGHT]
We need an input to roots(...) that will produce the dictionary {0: 1}.

- The simplest way is to pass the polynomial f = x (a degree-1 polynomial with root 0).
- With no generators given, Poly(x) will use x as its generator. For degree 1 the code sets result[roots_linear(f)[0]] = 1, and roots_linear for Poly(x) yields 0.
- No flags or extra gens are required.

So call roots with a single Symbol x (i.e. f = x) and no extra args/kwargs.
