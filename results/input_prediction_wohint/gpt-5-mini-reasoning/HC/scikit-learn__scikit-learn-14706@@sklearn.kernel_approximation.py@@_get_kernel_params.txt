We need to find a self state that makes _get_kernel_params() return {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}.

Examine _get_kernel_params:
- It starts with params = self.kernel_params; if params is None it uses an empty dict.
- If self.kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed', it iterates over KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel] and for each param name adds params[param] = getattr(self, param) if that attribute is not None.
- Otherwise (kernel is callable or 'precomputed'), if any of gamma, coef0, degree is not None it raises ValueError.

To get only "coef0" and "degree" keys (and not "gamma"), we want:
- self.kernel to be a named kernel (not callable and not 'precomputed') whose KERNEL_PARAMS include 'degree' and 'coef0' — the polynomial kernel ('poly') fits.
- self.degree == 3.1 and self.coef0 == 0.1 so these are added.
- self.gamma must be None so 'gamma' is not added.
- self.kernel_params can be None (so params starts as {}) or an empty dict; using None is simplest.

Thus the predicted input is a self object with kernel = "poly", gamma = null, coef0 = 0.1, degree = 3.1, kernel_params = null, and no additional args/kwargs.
