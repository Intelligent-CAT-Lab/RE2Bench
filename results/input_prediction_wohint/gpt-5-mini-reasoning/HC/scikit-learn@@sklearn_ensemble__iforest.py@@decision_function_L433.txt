[THOUGHT]
1. decision_function returns self.score_samples(X) - self.offset_.
2. The observed output is array([0., 0.]), so for each sample score_samples(X) must equal self.offset_.
3. The simplest consistent choice is to set offset_ = 0.0 and have score_samples(X) return [0.0, 0.0]. I'll provide X as a 2-sample input (2x1 array of zeros) and indicate that score_samples returns the matching array.
4. The input JSON will include the relevant self attribute (offset_) and the function argument X. I'll also indicate (as a value used at call time) that score_samples would return [0.0, 0.0] for that X.
