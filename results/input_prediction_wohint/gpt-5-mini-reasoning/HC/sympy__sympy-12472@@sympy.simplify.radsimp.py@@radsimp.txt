[THOUGHT]
We need an input expr that radsimp will transform to 1/(a - b).

A straightforward candidate is
  1/((sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))
because (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) = a - b, so this expression equals 1/(a - b). The radsimp code works by taking the fraction of expr and simplifying/rationalizing the denominator; for this input it will detect the product of two conjugate square roots and reduce the denominator to a - b, producing 1/(a - b).

I'll include the default values for the optional parameters symbolic and max_terms.

So the function input will be the expression "1/((sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)))", symbolic = true, max_terms = 4.
