[THOUGHT]
We need an _args such that the function returns two ExprCondPair entries:
  (1, x < 0)
  (3, True)

Walk through the code:
- For each (expr, cond) in _args, cond is run through cond.replace(lambda _: _.is_Relational, _canonical_coeff). If cond is a simple relational like x < 0 this replacement will leave it effectively unchanged.
- The code skips handling of Piecewise unless expr is a Piecewise; choosing expr as simple integers avoids that branch.
- current_cond starts empty, so neither pair will be considered redundant or removed.
- No And/Relational simplifications are triggered for these simple inputs.
- The function will append ExprCondPair(1, x < 0) then ExprCondPair(3, True), producing exactly the output shown.

Therefore the simplest matching input is a list of two pairs:
  [(1, x < 0), (3, True)]

I will represent the relational as the string "x < 0" (the code would actually expect a SymPy relational, but this JSON representation indicates that condition), and True as a boolean.
