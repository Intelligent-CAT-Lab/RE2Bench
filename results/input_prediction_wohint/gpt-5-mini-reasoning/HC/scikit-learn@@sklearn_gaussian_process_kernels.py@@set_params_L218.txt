The output "RBF(length_scale=0.112)" is the string representation of an RBF kernel after its length_scale parameter has been set to 0.112. Kernel.set_params accepts keyword parameters and assigns them to attributes if they are valid parameters returned by get_params. Therefore set_params must have been called with the kwarg {"length_scale": 0.112} on an instance of an RBF kernel (self) which has a length_scale attribute. I represent the kernel object with class "RBF" and an initial length_scale (e.g., 1.0) that set_params updates to 0.112. The call passes no positional args.
