[THOUGHT]
- The output string "GridSpec(1, 1)[0:1, 0:1]" indicates a GridSpec with geometry (1, 1).
- That means self.get_geometry() returned (1, 1), so the GridSpecBase instance was created with nrows=1 and ncols=1.
- The bracketed part "[0:1, 0:1]" corresponds to a tuple of two slice objects slice(0, 1) for the row and column selection.
- Therefore __getitem__ was called on a GridSpecBase with _nrows=1 and _ncols=1, and the key argument was the tuple (slice(0,1), slice(0,1)).
- Representing slices in JSON, provide them as objects with start, stop, step (null for step).
