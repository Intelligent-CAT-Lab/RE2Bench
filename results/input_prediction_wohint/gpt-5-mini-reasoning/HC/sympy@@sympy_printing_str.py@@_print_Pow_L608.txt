[THOUGHT]
To get the output "sqrt(2)", the branch in _print_Pow that runs is the first if:
    if expr.exp is S.Half and (not rational):
        return 'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base)

So expr.exp must be S.Half (SymPy Rational(1,2)), rational must be False (default), and self._print(expr.base) must produce "2". That happens when expr.base is the integer 2 (sympy.Integer(2)). expr.is_commutative is irrelevant because this branch runs before the commutative checks.

Therefore the input is a StrPrinter instance (rational left as default False) and a Pow-like expr with base = 2 and exp = S.Half.
