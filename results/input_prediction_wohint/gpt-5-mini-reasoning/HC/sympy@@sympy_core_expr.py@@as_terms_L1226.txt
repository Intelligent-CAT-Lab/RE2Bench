[THOUGHT]
We need an Expr (self) such that as_terms produces four term entries for y**2, z**2, -w**2, -x**2 and gens list ["w","x","y","z"].

- as_terms iterates Add.make_args(self) to get the terms. So self must be an Add expression whose args are these four terms (or equivalent).
- For each term, as_coeff_Mul yields coefficient and remaining multiplicative part. For y**2 and z**2 the coefficient is 1, for -w**2 and -x**2 the coefficient is -1.
- decompose_power on each base**2 yields (base, 2), so cpart maps each base to exponent 2 and gens_set collects {w,x,y,z}.
- default_sort_key sorts gens into the order ["w","x","y","z"] (consistent with the returned gens).
- The monomial tuples are then (exponents in gens order): y**2 -> [0,0,2,0], z**2 -> [0,0,0,2], -w**2 -> [2,0,0,0], -x**2 -> [0,2,0,0], matching the output coefficients and tuples.

Thus the simplest input is the expression: y**2 + z**2 - w**2 - x**2 (a SymPy Expr with symbols w,x,y,z). No additional args are required.
