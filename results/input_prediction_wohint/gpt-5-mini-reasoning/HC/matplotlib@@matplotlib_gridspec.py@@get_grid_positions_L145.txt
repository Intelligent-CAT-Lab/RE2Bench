[THOUGHT]
We need to find inputs (self and fig) that produce these outputs from get_grid_positions:
fig_bottoms = [0.1], fig_tops = [0.9], fig_lefts = [0.125], fig_rights = [0.9]

For a 1x1 grid (nrows = ncols = 1) the code reduces to:
- cell_h = tot_height = top - bottom
- fig_tops = [top]
- fig_bottoms = [top - cell_h] = [bottom]
So top = 0.9 and bottom = 0.1 (since fig_tops = 0.9 and fig_bottoms = 0.1), giving cell_h = 0.8.

For columns:
- cell_w = tot_width = right - left
- fig_lefts = [left]
- fig_rights = [left + cell_w] = [right]
So left = 0.125 and right = 0.9, giving cell_w = 0.775.

Thus the GridSpec must have nrows = 1, ncols = 1, row/col ratios can be the defaults [1], and the subplot params must provide left=0.125, right=0.9, bottom=0.1, top=0.9. hspace/wspace do not matter for 1x1 (they multiply by n-1 = 0).

I'll present self with those numeric attributes and a placeholder _subplot_spec/position indicating extents, and pass fig as None (the subplot params are supplied via self._subplot_spec in this input representation).
