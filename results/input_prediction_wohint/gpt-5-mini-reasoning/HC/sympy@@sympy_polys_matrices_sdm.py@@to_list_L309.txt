We need to reconstruct the SDM instance M that to_list(M) processed to produce the given 2x2 nested list of Matrix string representations.

1. to_list builds an m x n list ddm using M.shape (m,n). The output is a 2x2 list, so M.shape must be (2, 2).
2. to_list initializes all entries with M.domain.zero but then overwrites any positions present in M (the dict) with the explicit elements from M.items().
3. The final ddm contains four matrix values (none are the zero placeholder), therefore M must provide entries for all positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).
4. The element values must match the strings shown in the output. We represent those matrix elements as the corresponding values in the nested row dictionaries.
5. domain.zero is unused in the final result (since all positions are overwritten), but we still supply a placeholder for domain.zero.

So the SDM instance (the "self" passed to to_list) is a dict with keys 0 and 1 (each mapping to a dict of column->element), plus attributes shape and domain. We include args/kwargs as empty (method called without extra args).

The input below encodes that SDM instance and its contents matching the provided output.
