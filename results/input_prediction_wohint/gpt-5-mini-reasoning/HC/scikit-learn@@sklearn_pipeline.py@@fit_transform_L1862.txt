[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to FeatureUnion.fit_transform that produce the 2x4 array:
[[1., 1., 1., 0.],
 [1., 1., 0., 1.]]

FeatureUnion concatenates (hstack) the outputs of its transformers. So pick two transformers whose outputs (Xs) hstack to the target:

- Transformer 1 should produce a 2x2 array of all ones:
  [[1., 1.],
   [1., 1.]]
- Transformer 2 should produce a 2x2 identity-like array:
  [[1., 0.],
   [0., 1.]]

hstacking these yields the desired 2x4 array.

fit_transform receives X (with 2 samples). The transformers here ignore X (they return fixed arrays), so X can be any 2-sample array; choose X = [[0], [0]].

Represent the FeatureUnion instance with a transformer_list containing two transformers that, when fit_transform is called, return the arrays above. Other FeatureUnion attributes set to defaults (n_jobs, transformer_weights, verbose).

Now present the predicted input JSON.
