[THOUGHT]
1. The output X is a 2D array with 50 rows and 2 columns (counted 50 rows). So n_samples = 50 and n_features = 2.
2. All labels in y are 0 (length 50). That implies n_classes = 1 (so k % n_classes == 0 for all clusters).
3. The X rows are tightly clustered around large values ~328435 and ~-255363 with small per-row variation. This matches a large explicit shift vector being added (shift close to [328435, -255363]) and scale near 1. The default shift=0.0 would not produce those large offsets, so shift must have been provided.
4. To avoid redundancy errors with n_features=2, set n_informative=2 and set n_redundant and n_repeated to 0.
5. Keep other parameters at typical defaults (n_clusters_per_class=2 etc.). Provide a fixed random_state (e.g. 0) to yield a deterministic X.

Therefore plausible input arguments that produce the given output:
- n_samples: 50
- n_features: 2
- n_informative: 2
- n_redundant: 0
- n_repeated: 0
- n_classes: 1
- shift: [328435.0, -255363.0]
- scale: 1.0
- random_state: 0
(others left as defaults)
