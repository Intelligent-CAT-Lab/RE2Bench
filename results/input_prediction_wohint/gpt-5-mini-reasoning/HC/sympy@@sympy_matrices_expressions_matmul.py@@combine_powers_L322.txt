[THOUGHT]
We need an input for combine_powers(mul) that leads to the returned expression being "X*Z".

combine_powers does:
- factor, args = mul.as_coeff_matrices()
- new_args = [args[0]]
- then loops for i in range(1, len(args)); if len(args) == 1 the loop body is skipped
- returns newmul(factor, *new_args), which for a scalar factor "X" and a single matrix argument "Z" yields "X*Z"

Therefore the simplest input is a MatMul-like object whose as_coeff_matrices() returns factor = "X" and matrices list = ["Z"]. That makes new_args = ["Z"], no changes in the loop, and newmul("X", "Z") -> "X*Z".

So provide mul described by its as_coeff_matrices return values.
