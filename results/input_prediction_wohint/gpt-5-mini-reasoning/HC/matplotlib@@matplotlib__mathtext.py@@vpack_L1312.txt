[THOUGHT]
We need to infer the arguments with which vpack was called given the output null (None). vpack always returns None (either via an explicit return when x == 0 or implicitly at the end), so many different inputs could produce the same output. The typical call site is Vlist.__init__, which calls self.vpack(h=h, m=m) and does not pass l (so l uses its default np.inf). In the provided Vlist.__init__ signature the default values are h=0.0 and m='additional'. The simplest and most likely call consistent with the code and the shown output is the default-case call from __init__ with an (empty) elements sequence and default h and m.

Therefore I predict vpack was invoked as vpack(self=<Vlist with no children>, h=0.0, m='additional') with l left as the default (np.inf). Representing the Vlist instance minimally with an empty children list.
