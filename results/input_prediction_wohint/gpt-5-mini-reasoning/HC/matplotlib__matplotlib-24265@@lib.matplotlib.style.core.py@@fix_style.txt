[THOUGHT]
1. fix_style(s) returns s modified only if s is a str: first mapped via style_alias ('mpl20'->'default', 'mpl15'->'classic'), then possibly replaced if it's a deprecated seaborn style.
2. The output is "_classic_test_patch", which is not one of the aliases ('mpl20','mpl15') and not a seaborn deprecated key (those start with 'seaborn').
3. Therefore the function would return s unchanged. So the input s must have been the same string "_classic_test_patch".
