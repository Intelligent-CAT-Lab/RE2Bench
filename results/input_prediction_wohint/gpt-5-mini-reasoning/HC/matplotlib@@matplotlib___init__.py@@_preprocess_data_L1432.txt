[THOUGHT]
We need to determine what arguments were passed into _preprocess_data to produce the returned object shown:

    "<function test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs at 0x71b989c0c720>"

Looking at _preprocess_data:
- If func is None, it returns a functools.partial (not a function named like the wrapped function). The output is a function object with the name/qualname "test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs", so func was not None.
- The decorator returns an inner function that is wrapped with functools.wraps(func), so inner will have the same __name__ and qualname as the original func. That matches the output showing a function named func_kwargs defined inside test_compiletime_checks.
- replace_names and label_namer default to None; nothing in the output indicates they were provided. So the simplest input is that func was the original function object named test_compiletime_checks.<locals>.func_kwargs, and replace_names and label_namer were left as their defaults (None).

Therefore the input was the function object func_kwargs and the optional parameters were not provided (None).
