[THOUGHT]
We need an input eq that, when passed into _mask_nc, produces the returned expr string shown:
sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1

The function returns early if expr.is_commutative is True, returning (eq, {}, []). The output's second element is {} and the first element is the string form of eq, so eq must be an expression whose printed form matches the given string. The given string shows a sin(...) term whose argument is a quoted text "Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)". That indicates the inner argument was a Python string literal, not a SymPy Sum object; the whole expression is sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)")) + 1.

Thus the input to _mask_nc is eq = sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)")) + 1 and name left as default (null).
