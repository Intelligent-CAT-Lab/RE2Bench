[THOUGHT]
We need inputs (self, params, parent, caller) such that _route_params returns a Bunch with keys "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a".

- The method builds args = {k: v for k, v in params.items() if v is not None}. To get those values in the result, params must contain "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a".
- For each prop in self._requests:
  - If alias is True and prop in args, then res[prop] = args[prop].
  - If alias is None, the prop would be treated as unrequested (would raise).
  - If alias equals another name that appears in args, res[prop] would take that value.
- The simplest mapping is to set self._requests = {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}. Then both props present in params are copied into res and no UnsetMetadataPassedError is raised.

parent and caller are not used when no unrequested entries exist, so they can be any values.

Therefore the predicted input supplies self with _requests mapping and owner/method (method used only for messages), params containing the two keys, and arbitrary parent/caller.
