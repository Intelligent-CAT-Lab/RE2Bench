[THOUGHT]
The inner function create_method is defined as def create_method(name, method): and returns a wrapper decorated with @wraps(method). The functools.wraps decorator sets the wrapper's __wrapped__ attribute to the original method object.

The observed output JSON shows the wrapper has a __wrapped__ attribute whose value is represented as {}. That means the original method argument passed to create_method was a function object (represented here by {}).

The name argument only appears inside the wrapper (used with getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)) and is not reflected in the provided output, so it can be any string. I'll use "some_method_name" as a placeholder.

Therefore the inputs to create_method are:
- name: "some_method_name"
- method: {} (placeholder for the original function object)
