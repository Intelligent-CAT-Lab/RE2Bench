[THOUGHT]
We need an argument newbackend (a string) that lets switch_backend run to completion and implicitly return None (matching the observed output null).

Key branches to consider:
- If newbackend is rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel, a complex search path is executed. Avoid that.
- The function will call backend_registry.load_backend_module(newbackend), which must successfully import a backend module.
- The backend's FigureCanvas.required_interactive_framework must either be None or match the currently running interactive framework; otherwise an ImportError is raised.
- install_repl_displayhook() is called at the end; it may set internal state but only raises NotImplementedError (caught and converted to ImportError). To avoid that, pick a widely available non-interactive backend.

A safe choice is "agg" (Matplotlib's default non-interactive raster backend). Loading "agg" should succeed, its canvas typically has no required interactive framework, and install_repl_displayhook will not raise an uncaught exception. Therefore switch_backend("agg") will complete and return None, matching {"output": null}.
