[THOUGHT]
The function returns (polys, opt). The output shows two Poly objects:
- "Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')" — a constant polynomial 2 with generator cos(phi).
- "Poly(-2*(cos(phi)), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')" — polynomial -2*cos(phi), i.e. -2 times the generator.

This indicates:
- The function processed two expressions (len(exprs) == 2).
- The early branch for two Poly instances was not taken (opt.polys in the final opt is false), so the inputs were ordinary expressions (not Poly objects).
- _parallel_dict_from_expr discovered the single generator cos(phi) and construct_domain produced domain 'ZZ' (integer coefficients). The coefficients are integers (2 and -2) and the generator is cos(phi), so exprs must have been equivalent to [2, -2*cos(phi)].
- The initial opt likely had gens and domain unset (None) and polys unset (None), so after processing opt.gens became ["cos(phi)"], opt.domain became "ZZ", and opt.polys was set to False (since no input Poly objects).

Therefore a minimal plausible input is:
- exprs: [ "2", "-2*cos(phi)" ] (strings that sympify to the needed SymPy expressions)
- opt: an options-like object represented as a dict with gens=null, domain=null, polys=null (and expand true by default)

I will represent None as null in JSON.
