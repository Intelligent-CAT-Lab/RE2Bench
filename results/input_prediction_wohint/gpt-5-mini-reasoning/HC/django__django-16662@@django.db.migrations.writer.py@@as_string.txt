[THOUGHT]
We need the minimal MigrationWriter state that produces the given migration string.

1. as_string builds imports and class body from self.migration and self.include_header.
2. The output contains only "from django.db import migrations" as imports and no migration header, no replaces block, no initial flag, no dependencies, and no operations.
3. Therefore:
   - self.migration.operations must be an empty list (so operations block is empty).
   - self.migration.dependencies must be an empty list (so dependencies block is empty).
   - self.migration.replaces must be falsy (e.g., empty list) so replaces_str is empty.
   - self.migration.initial must be falsy (False) so initial_str is empty.
   - self.include_header must be False so migration_header is empty.
4. No other attributes are required by as_string for this case.

So the input is a MigrationWriter instance with those migration attributes and include_header False; no positional or keyword args.
