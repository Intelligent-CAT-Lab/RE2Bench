[THOUGHT]
The confusion_matrix result is a 2x2 array with counts [[9, 0], [0, 11]]. That means there are two labels and all samples were correctly predicted (no off-diagonal counts). So there must be 9 samples of the first label and 11 of the second, with y_pred equal to y_true for each sample.

The simplest choice is numeric labels 0 and 1:
- y_true = [0]*9 + [1]*11
- y_pred = y_true

No sample_weight or labels or normalize are needed (they can be null/default).
