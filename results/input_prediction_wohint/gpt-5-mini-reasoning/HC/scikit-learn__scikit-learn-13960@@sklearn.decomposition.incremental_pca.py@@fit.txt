We need to infer what input to IncrementalPCA.fit produced the given final attributes.

1. The final n_samples_seen_ is 150 and mean_ is [5.84333333 3.05733333 3.758 1.19933333] — these are the canonical means of the Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features). The components_, singular_values_, explained_variance_ also match PCA results on the Iris dataset.
2. components_.shape is (2, 4) so n_components = 2 and n_features = 4.
3. batch_size_ is 50 in the final state. The constructor parameter batch_size is shown as 50 in the provided output, so the IncrementalPCA instance was created with batch_size=50 (not left None).
4. Therefore fit was called with X being the Iris data array of shape (150, 4). y was not used (None).
5. The self object before calling fit would have been initialized with n_components=2, whiten=False, copy=True, batch_size=50; other learned attributes (components_, mean_, etc.) would have been unset or None prior to fit (fit initializes them at start).

Based on this, the input to fit is the IncrementalPCA instance (with the constructor parameters above) and X equal to the Iris dataset (150 samples × 4 features). I represent the dataset by name/shape in the JSON input for brevity.
