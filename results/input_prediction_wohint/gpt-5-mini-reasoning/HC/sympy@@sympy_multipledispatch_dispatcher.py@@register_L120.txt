[THOUGHT]
The register method returns the inner function _ (a decorator) whenever it's called. The output shows that a function object (Dispatcher.register.<locals>._) was returned. That occurs even if register was called with no positional types and no keyword args. So the simplest input consistent with the output is a call like dispatcher.register().

I'll provide a plausible Dispatcher instance state (as created by __init__) and empty args/kwargs.
