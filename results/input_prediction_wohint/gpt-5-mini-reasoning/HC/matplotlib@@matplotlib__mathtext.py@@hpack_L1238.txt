[THOUGHT]
We need an input that leads hpack to return None (output null). hpack always has no explicit return, so it returns None in all cases; but the function has an early return when x == 0.0 after computing widths.

To keep execution simple and avoid any calls to _set_glue, choose a self with no children so the loop doesn't add width (x stays 0.0). Use w = 0.0 (the default) and m = 'additional' (default). Steps:
- children empty -> loop doesn't change x, h, d.
- self.height and self.depth set to 0.0.
- m == 'additional' so w += x -> w remains 0.0.
- self.width = w -> 0.0.
- x = w - x -> 0.0.
- x == 0.0 triggers setting glue_sign = 0, glue_order = 0, glue_ratio = 0.0 and returns None.

Thus a minimal, valid input is self with children = [] and default w and m.
