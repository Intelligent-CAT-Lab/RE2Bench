[THOUGHT]
We need self such that the method returns [2].

1. The method starts with output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]. To get [2], self.categories_ should be a sequence with one element whose length is 2, e.g. [['a', 'b']].

2. If self._drop_idx_after_grouping is not None, some entries could be decremented. To avoid that, set _drop_idx_after_grouping to None.

3. If self._infrequent_enabled is True, further decrements may occur. To avoid that, set _infrequent_enabled to False.

With these attributes:
- output becomes [2] from the first line,
- _drop_idx_after_grouping is None so no change,
- _infrequent_enabled is False so the function returns output immediately.

No positional or keyword arguments are required.
