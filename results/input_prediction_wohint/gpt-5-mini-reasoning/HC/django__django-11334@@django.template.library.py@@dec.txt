[THOUGHT]
- The dec function is the decorator returned by Library.simple_tag when simple_tag is called with func=None.
- dec takes a single argument func, which is the user-defined function being decorated.
- The provided output is the serialized attributes of that function (module, name, qualname, docstring, annotations, and __wrapped__).
- Therefore the input to dec is a Library instance as self (with empty filters/tags by default) and the func object having exactly those attributes.
