[THOUGHT]
The method axis_aligned_extrema immediately returns (np.array([]), np.array([])) when the degree n <= 1 (first lines of the method). Degree is self._N - 1, so this happens when self._N <= 2. The simplest case is a single control point (self._N == 1), e.g. control_points = [[0.0, 0.0]], which yields degree 0 and triggers the early return. The method doesn't need polynomial coefficients in this path, so only _N (and plausibly _cpoints/_d) must be consistent.
