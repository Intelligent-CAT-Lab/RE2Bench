[THOUGHT]
We need a self value that makes __int__ produce no JSON output (null). The function body starts by accessing self._mpf_. If that attribute doesn't exist, Python raises AttributeError and the function does not return a value (the call fails), which is represented as null in the given output. Therefore the simplest input causing this is an object (here represented as a mapping) without a _mpf_ attribute.
