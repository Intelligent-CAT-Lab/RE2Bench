[THOUGHT]
We need Xs such that _hstack returns the 2x3 array:
[[-1. -1.  2.]
 [ 1.  1.  5.]]

_hstack (non-sparse branch) does:
- convert sparse inputs to dense (not relevant if inputs are numpy arrays),
- get output config and, unless config['dense']=='pandas' with all Xs supporting .iloc, it returns np.hstack(Xs).

So choose Xs as three 2x1 arrays that horizontally stack to the target:
col1 = [[-1.], [1.]]
col2 = [[-1.], [1.]]
col3 = [[2.], [5.]]

Also ensure self.sparse_output_ is False so the non-sparse branch is taken.
