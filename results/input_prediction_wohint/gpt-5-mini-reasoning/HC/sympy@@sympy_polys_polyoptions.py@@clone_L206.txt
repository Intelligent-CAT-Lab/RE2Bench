[THOUGHT]
The clone method simply creates a new dict-like object, copies all items from self, then applies updates (overwriting or adding keys). The output matches exactly a dict with keys "fraction": true and "gens": ["cos(phi)"]. The simplest explanation is that updates was empty and self already contained those keys/values. Therefore provide self with those items and an empty updates.
