[THOUGHT]
We need inputs to polytope_integrate that produce the numeric result 1/8.

- polytope_integrate integrates the given expression over the provided polytope. If poly is a 2D Polygon and expr is a scalar constant, the integral is just the polygon area times that constant.
- So a simple way to get 1/8 is to use expr = 1 and pick a polygon of area 1/8.
- A triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1/4) has area = base*height/2 = 1 * (1/4) / 2 = 1/8.
- Therefore calling polytope_integrate(poly=Polygon((0,0),(1,0),(0,1/4)), expr=1) should return 1/8.

I'll represent the polygon as a list of vertex coordinate pairs and the expression as the number 1 (using a rational "1/4" for exactness of the vertex y-coordinate).
