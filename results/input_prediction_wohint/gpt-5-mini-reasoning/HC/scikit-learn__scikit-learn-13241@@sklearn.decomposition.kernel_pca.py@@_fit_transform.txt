[THOUGHT]
The first line of _fit_transform is K = self._centerer.fit_transform(K). KernelCenterer centers the kernel matrix by subtracting column/row means and adding the overall mean. The provided matrix has each row summing to 0 (check: every row sums to ~0), so its column means and overall mean are zero — i.e., it is already centered. Therefore fit_transform would return the same matrix unchanged. Consequently the input K to _fit_transform must be exactly the matrix shown in the output. I will provide the call with that matrix as the argument.
