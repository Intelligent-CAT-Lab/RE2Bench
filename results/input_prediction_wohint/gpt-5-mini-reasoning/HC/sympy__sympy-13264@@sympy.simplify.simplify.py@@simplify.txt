[THOUGHT]
The function returns the SymPy expression printed as "n + n**(-n)". The simplest input that sympifies to that and will be returned unchanged by simplify is the expression n + n**(-n) (with n a symbolic variable). The function's other parameters use their defaults (ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, rational=False). Represent the expression as a string that sympify can parse.
