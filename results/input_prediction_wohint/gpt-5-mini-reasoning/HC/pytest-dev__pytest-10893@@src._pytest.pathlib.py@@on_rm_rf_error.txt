[THOUGHT]
We need inputs that make on_rm_rf_error return True.

Checking the function:
- excinfo must not indicate FileNotFoundError and must be a PermissionError. The simplest choice is excinfo being a PermissionError instance (not a tuple).
- func must be one of os.rmdir, os.remove, or os.unlink; otherwise the function returns False. I'll pick os.remove.
- path should be a path pointing to an existing file/entry so that os.stat/os.chmod and func(path) succeed; using "/tmp/somefile" is a reasonable example.
- start_path should be a Path object that can appear in p.parents; using "/tmp" is appropriate.

These inputs satisfy:
- exc is a PermissionError -> continue
- func is os.remove -> continue
- chmod and func(path) would be called and (assuming filesystem permits) the function returns True.

I'll represent func and start_path as their canonical strings and excinfo as a PermissionError instance representation.
