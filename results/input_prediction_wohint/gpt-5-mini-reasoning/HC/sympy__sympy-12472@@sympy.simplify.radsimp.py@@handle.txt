[THOUGHT]
- radsimp returns coeff + _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d).
- The final output "1/(a - b)" implies coeff = 0, n = 1, d = a - b.
- Inside radsimp, it calls n, d = fraction(handle(expr)), so handle(expr) must produce a form whose numerator and denominator are 1 and (a - b).
- handle begins by computing n, d = fraction(expr), so the simplest input that yields n = 1 and d = a - b is expr = 1/(a - b).
- Therefore handle was called with expr equal to 1/(a - b).
