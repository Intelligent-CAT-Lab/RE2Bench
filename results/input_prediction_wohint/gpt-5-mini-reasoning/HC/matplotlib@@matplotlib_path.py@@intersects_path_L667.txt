[THOUGHT]
The method Path.intersects_path simply returns _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled). To get True, choose two Path instances whose filled areas overlap. I will represent each Path by the attributes the properties access: _vertices and _codes (codes can be null). Use two simple axis-aligned squares that overlap (e.g., one from (0,0) to (1,1), the other from (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,1.5)). Use filled=True (the default) explicitly.
