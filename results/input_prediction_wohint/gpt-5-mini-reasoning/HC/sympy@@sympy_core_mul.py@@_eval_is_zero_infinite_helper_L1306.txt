[THOUGHT]
We need self.args such that the method returns (False, False).

The method initializes seen_zero = seen_infinite = False. To keep both False at the end, no branch can set them to True or None.

- If any a.is_zero is truthy -> seen_zero becomes True (bad).
- If any a.is_infinite is truthy -> seen_infinite becomes True (bad).
- In the else branch (when both checks are falsy), seen_zero becomes None if seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None. To avoid that, a.is_zero must not be None; since it's falsy, it must be False.
- Similarly, a.is_infinite must be False (not None).

Therefore every element in self.args must have is_zero == False and is_infinite == False. Provide a simple self with one or more such args. I'll give two args for clarity.
