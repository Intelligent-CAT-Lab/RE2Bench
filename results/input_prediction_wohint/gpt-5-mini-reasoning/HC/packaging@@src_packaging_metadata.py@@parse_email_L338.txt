[THOUGHT]
We need parse_email to return (raw, unparsed) equal to [{"download_url": "VaLuE"}, {}].

- parse_email lowercases header names and looks up each in _EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING to get a raw_name. The packaging metadata mapping maps the header "Download-URL" to the raw key "download_url". So adding a header "Download-URL: VaLuE" will produce raw['download_url'] = "VaLuE" (it's a single-string field).
- We must ensure valid_encoding stays True (use plain ASCII/UTF-8 text), so the header value "VaLuE" is fine.
- The function also processes the payload. If input is a str, _get_payload returns the message payload as a str. If the payload is empty (no body), parse_email will not add anything to raw or unparsed for the body. So provide an email string with headers and an empty body (i.e., a blank line after headers).
- Therefore the input should be the raw email as a string: "Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n".

So the predicted input argument is data = "Download-URL: VaLuE\n\n".
