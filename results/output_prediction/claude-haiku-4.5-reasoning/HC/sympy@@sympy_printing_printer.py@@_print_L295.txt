[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `_print` method:

1. Input: `self` is a base Printer instance, `expr = "phi"` (a string)

2. The `_print` method is called:
   - `self._print_level` is incremented (from 1 to 2)
   - `self.printmethod` is None (class attribute), so the first if block is skipped
   
3. Get the MRO of the string type:
   - `classes = type("phi").__mro__ = (str, object)`
   
4. Check for special function types:
   - `AppliedUndef` not in classes
   - `UndefinedFunction` not in classes  
   - `Function` not in classes
   
5. Loop through the MRO looking for print methods:
   - For class `str`: look for `_print_str` method in self - the base Printer class does not define this
   - For class `object`: look for `_print_object` method in self - not found
   
6. No print method found, so fall back to `emptyPrinter(expr)`

7. The `emptyPrinter` method is defined in the base Printer class as:
   ```python
   def emptyPrinter(self, expr):
       return str(expr)
   ```
   
8. `str("phi")` returns `"phi"`

9. Finally block: `self._print_level` is decremented back to 1

10. Return `"phi"`

So the output is simply the string `"phi"`.
