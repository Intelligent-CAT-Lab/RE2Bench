[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_setup`:

1. **Initial setup**: `new = copy(self)` creates a copy of the input object.

2. **Tick params check**: Since `new._tick_params is None`, the code calls `new = new.tick()`. This method would initialize `_tick_params` with the dict structure shown (locator, at, upto, count, every, between, minor). Without the full `tick()` implementation, these fields would likely be initialized to None or default values.

3. **Label params check**: The condition `if new._label_params is None` is FALSE because the input has `_label_params` as `{"formatter": null, "like": null, "base": null, "unit": null}`, so `new.label()` is NOT called. `_label_params` remains unchanged.

4. **Transform and scale**: The code calls `_get_transform()` (not defined, but would return forward/inverse transform functions for the "log" transform) and `_get_scale()` (would create a matplotlib scale object).

5. **Axis setup**: Since `axis is None`, a `PseudoAxis` is created with the mpl_scale.

6. **Normalize section**: `prop.normed` is not defined in the input, so assuming it's False/not set, `normalize = vmin = vmax = None`.

7. **Pipeline**: Creates `new._pipeline` as a list with 4 elements (though these are callable objects).

8. **Spacer**: Defines and assigns the `_spacer` function.

9. **Legend check**: `prop.legend` is not defined in the input, so it's not set to the legend tuple. `new._legend` remains `None`.

10. **Return**: Returns the modified `new` object.

Since many helper methods and the full class definition are missing, I'm making reasonable assumptions that:
- `tick()` initializes `_tick_params` with None values for each field
- `_legend` stays null since `prop.legend` isn't set  
- `_pipeline` and `_spacer` contain callable objects (represented as null/{}  in JSON)
- `_matplotlib_scale._transform` structure is populated by the scale setup
- Simple attributes like `values`, `norm`, `trans` remain unchanged
