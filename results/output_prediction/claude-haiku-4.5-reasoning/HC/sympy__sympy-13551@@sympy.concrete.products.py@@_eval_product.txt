[THOUGHT]
Looking at the input provided:
- `term = "(i**2 + 5*i + 4)/(i**2 + 2*i - 3)"` (a string representing a rational function)
- `limits = ["u + v", "u - 1"]` (a list with 2 string elements)

The `_eval_product` method begins with:
```python
def _eval_product(self, term, limits):
    from sympy.concrete.delta import deltaproduct, _has_simple_delta
    from sympy.concrete.summations import summation
    from sympy.functions import KroneckerDelta, RisingFactorial
    k, a, n = limits  # <-- THIS LINE
```

The first operation is to unpack `limits` into three variables: `k, a, n = limits`.

However, the provided `limits` is a list with only 2 elements: `["u + v", "u - 1"]`

When Python attempts to unpack a 2-element list into 3 variables, it raises a `ValueError` because there are not enough values to unpack.

The function signature for `_eval_product(self, term, limits)` expects `limits` to be a 3-tuple or 3-element sequence of the form `(k, a, n)` where:
- `k` is the index variable
- `a` is the lower limit
- `n` is the upper limit

Since the input provides only 2 elements in the limits list, the unpacking will immediately fail before any further computation can occur.
