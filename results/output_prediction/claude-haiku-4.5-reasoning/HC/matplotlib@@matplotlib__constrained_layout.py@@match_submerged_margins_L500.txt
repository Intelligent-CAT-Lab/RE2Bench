[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `match_submerged_margins(layoutgrids, fig)`:

1. **Initialize axsdone**: `axsdone = []` - an empty list

2. **Process subfigures**: `for sfig in fig.subfigs:` - For a typical figure, subfigs would be empty or minimal, so this loop likely doesn't add anything significant to axsdone

3. **Get filtered axes**: 
```python
axs = [a for a in fig.get_axes() if a.get_subplotspec() is not None and a.get_in_layout() and (a not in axsdone)]
```
The figure is described as having "2 Axes", and based on the GridSpec(1, 2) layout provided in layoutgrids, we would expect fig.get_axes() to return 2 axes. Both axes should:
   - Have a subplotspec (they're in the GridSpec)
   - Be in layout 
   - Not be in axsdone (which is empty)

So `axs` would contain 2 axes initially.

4. **Process each axis in the loop**:
For each axis (ax1):
   - Get its subplotspec: `ss1 = ax1.get_subplotspec()`
   - Check if gridspec is in layoutgrids: `ss1.get_gridspec()` would return GridSpec(1, 2), which IS in the layoutgrids dict ✓
   - Check `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1`: For GridSpec(1, 2) with each axis occupying a single column, len(colspan) = 1 for each axis, so this condition is False
   - Check `if len(ss1.rowspan) > 1`: For GridSpec(1, 2) with each axis occupying a single row, len(rowspan) = 1 for each axis, so this condition is False

Since no spanning occurs (no axes span multiple columns or rows), no margin adjustments are made.

5. **Return value**: The function returns `axs`, which is the list of 2 processed axes from the figure.

Since axes are complex matplotlib objects that cannot be directly serialized to JSON, they are represented as Axes objects in the output.
