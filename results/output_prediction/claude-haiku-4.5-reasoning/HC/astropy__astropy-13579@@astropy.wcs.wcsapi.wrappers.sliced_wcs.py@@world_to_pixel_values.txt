[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `world_to_pixel_values` step by step:

1. The function is called with no positional arguments (args is empty), so `world_arrays = ()`

2. First line: `sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`
   - From the input, `_pixel_keep = "[0 1]"` (interpreting as a numpy array [0, 1] with length 2)
   - So this expands to: `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`

3. Inside `_pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`:
   ```python
   pixel_arrays = tuple(map(np.asanyarray, [0, 0]))
   # Results in: (array(0), array(0))
   
   pixel_arrays_new = []
   ipix_curr = -1
   for ipix in range(self._wcs.pixel_n_dim):  # range(3) since naxis=3
       if isinstance(self._slices_pixel[ipix], numbers.Integral):
   ```

4. **Critical issue**: When the loop tries to evaluate the condition on the first iteration (ipix=0), it attempts to access `self._slices_pixel[0]`. However, from the input, `_slices_pixel = null` (which is `None` in Python).

5. Attempting to subscript `None` with `None[0]` raises:
   ```
   TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
   ```

This error occurs because the code tries to index into `self._slices_pixel` before checking if it's `None`. The function never completes normally; it raises an exception immediately in `_pixel_to_world_values_all`.

The exception would be raised at the line with `isinstance(self._slices_pixel[ipix], numbers.Integral)` during the first iteration of the loop.
