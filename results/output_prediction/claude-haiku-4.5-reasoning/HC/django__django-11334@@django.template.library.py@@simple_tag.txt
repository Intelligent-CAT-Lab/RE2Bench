[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `simple_tag` method with the given input.

Given input:
- `self` is a Library instance with `filters={}` and `tags={}`
- `func = {}` (an empty dictionary)
- `takes_context = None` (default)
- `name = None` (default)

The method evaluates three conditions:

1. `if func is None:` 
   - `func = {}` (empty dict), not None → False

2. `elif callable(func):`
   - In Python, `callable({})` returns `False` because an empty dictionary is not a callable object → False

3. `else:`
   - This branch executes since both previous conditions are False
   - The code executes: `raise ValueError('Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag')`

Since `func` is an empty dictionary (not None and not callable), the function would raise a `ValueError` with the message 'Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag'.

However, following the output structure provided, which is an empty object `{}`, the function does not return a normal value in this case due to the exception raised.
