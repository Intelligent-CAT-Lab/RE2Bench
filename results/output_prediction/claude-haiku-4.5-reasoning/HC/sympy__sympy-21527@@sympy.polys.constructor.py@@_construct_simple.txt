[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the execution of `_construct_simple` with the given input.

**Input parameters:**
- `coeffs = null` (None in Python)
- `opt = {}` (or an options object represented as empty)

**Execution trace:**

1. The function initializes:
   - `rationals = False`
   - `floats = False`
   - `complexes = False`
   - `algebraics = False`
   - `float_numbers = []`

2. Checks `if opt.extension is True:` - Assuming `opt` is an options object (as it should be in the SymPy context), `opt.extension` would be `None` or `False` (the default value when not explicitly set), so this condition is `False`

3. Goes to the else clause:
   - `is_algebraic = lambda coeff: False`

4. Attempts the for loop:
   ```python
   for coeff in coeffs:
   ```
   
   Since `coeffs` is `None` (null in JSON maps to None in Python), attempting to iterate over it raises:
   **`TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`**

The function does not successfully complete execution—it raises an exception when trying to iterate over `None`. Therefore, the function does not return any value.
