[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_set_params` step by step.

Given:
- `self.transformers` = `null`
- `attr` = `"_transformers"`
- `kwargs` = `{"trans1__with_mean": false}`

Execution of `_set_params`:

Step 1: Check if `attr` in `params`
- `"_transformers"` is not in `{"trans1__with_mean": false}`, so skip this block

Step 2: Get items from the attribute
```python
items = getattr(self, attr)  # getattr(self, "_transformers")
```

This invokes the `_transformers` property defined as:
```python
def _transformers(self):
    return [(name, trans) for name, trans, _ in self.transformers]
```

Since `self.transformers` is `null` (None), the list comprehension tries to iterate over None, which raises:
**TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable**

The error occurs before the function can proceed further. The method raises an exception during the property access, so `_set_params` never completes normal execution and never modifies any attributes of self.

Since the function raises an exception before returning, the state of `self` remains unchanged from its input state.
