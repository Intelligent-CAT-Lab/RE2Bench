[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `add_hash` method:

1. The method signature is: `def add_hash(self):` which takes only `self` as parameter
2. Inside `add_hash`:
   - First, it calls `_make_hash_script(self._cls, self._attrs, frozen=self._frozen, cache_hash=self._cache_hash)` 
   - This would generate a hash script and globals dictionary
   - Then it defines a nested function `attach_hash` that will be called later
   - It appends a tuple `(script, globs, attach_hash)` to `self._script_snippets`
   - **Finally, it returns `self`**

3. The return statement is: `return self`

The key characteristic of this method is that it's implementing the **builder pattern** for method chaining - it returns `self` (the same `_ClassBuilder` instance it was called on) after modifying its state by appending to `_script_snippets`.

When you call `add_hash()`, you get back the same `_ClassBuilder` object, allowing for chained method calls like `builder.add_hash().add_repr()`.

Therefore, the output of the `add_hash` method is `self` - the `_ClassBuilder` instance that called it.
