[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `build_lut()` function step by step:

1. **Call build_default_lut():**
   - Creates a bytearray of size LUT_SIZE (assumed 512 for 3×3 neighborhood = 2^9)
   - `m = 1 << 4 = 16` (binary: 10000)
   - For each index i from 0 to 511: `lut[i] = 1 if (i & 16) > 0 else 0`
   - This creates a default pattern: indices with bit 4 set get value 1, others get 0
   - Pattern: [0]×16 + [1]×16 + [0]×16 + [1]×16 + ... (repeats)

2. **Parse the patterns:**
   - Pattern 1: `"4:(... .1. .0.)->0"`
     - options = "4" (apply 4-fold rotation)
     - pattern = "....1..0." (after removing spaces, center=1, bottom-middle=0)
     - result = 0
   
   - Pattern 2: `"4:(... .1. ..0)->0"`
     - options = "4" 
     - pattern = "....1...0." (center=1, bottom-right=0)
     - result = 0

3. **Apply _pattern_permute():**
   - For each pattern with "4" option: generates 4 rotational variants
   - This creates 4 rotations per pattern = 8 compiled regex patterns total
   - Each "." becomes "[01]" (matches any bit), fixed positions stay fixed

4. **Build and apply compiled patterns:**
   - Convert each compiled regex pattern to binary matching rules
   - For each index i (0-511):
     - Convert i to 9-bit binary (LSB-first)
     - Check if it matches any compiled pattern
     - If matches: `lut[i] = 0` (the result value)
     - Otherwise: `lut[i]` keeps default value

5. **Return:**
   - The modified bytearray is returned

The result is a bytearray with 512 bytes. The default pattern of alternating zeros and ones (based on bit 4) is modified for indices matching the erosion patterns, which are set to 0.

Without the exact ROTATION_MATRIX constant and running the code, I cannot compute every exact value, but the output structure would be a bytearray of 512 elements following the default pattern with specific indices modified.
