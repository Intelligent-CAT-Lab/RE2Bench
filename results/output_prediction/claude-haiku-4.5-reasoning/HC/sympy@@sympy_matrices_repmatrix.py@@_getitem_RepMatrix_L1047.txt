[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through `_getitem_RepMatrix` with `key = [0, 0]` (a list).

1. First check: `isinstance(key, tuple)` 
   - `[0, 0]` is a list, not a tuple, so this is `False`
   - We go to the `else` branch

2. In the else branch:
   - `rows, cols = self.shape` → `rows = 3, cols = 3`
   - `if not rows * cols:` → `not 9` is `False`, so we skip the early return
   - `rep = self._rep.rep`
   - `domain = rep.domain`
   - `is_slice = isinstance(key, slice)` → `isinstance([0, 0], slice)` is `False`

3. Since `is_slice` is `False`:
   ```python
   values = [rep.getitem(*divmod(index_(key), cols))]
   ```
   
   This line attempts to call `index_(key)` where `key = [0, 0]`

4. The function `index_` is imported as `from operator import index as index_`, so it calls `operator.index([0, 0])`.

5. `operator.index([0, 0])` attempts to call `[0, 0].__index__()`, but lists don't have an `__index__` method.

6. This raises a `TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`

The function never completes successfully - it raises an exception at the point where it tries to convert the list to an integer index.
