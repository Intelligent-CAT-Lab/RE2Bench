[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step:

1. `__getitem__` is called with `self` being a GridSpecBase instance and `key = [0, 0]` (a Python list)

2. First, `get_geometry()` is called:
   - Returns `(self._nrows, self._ncols)` = `(1, 1)`
   - So `nrows = 1, ncols = 1`

3. The nested `_normalize` function is defined locally within `__getitem__`

4. The code checks: `if isinstance(key, tuple):`
   - `key = [0, 0]` is a **list**, not a tuple
   - `isinstance([0, 0], tuple)` returns **False**

5. Therefore, execution goes to the **else branch**:
   ```python
   num1, num2 = _normalize(key, nrows * ncols, None)
   ```
   - This calls `_normalize([0, 0], 1, None)`

6. Inside the `_normalize` function with arguments `([0, 0], 1, None)`:
   - `key = [0, 0]`, `size = 1`, `axis = None`
   - `isinstance(key, slice)` is False, so we go to the else block
   - Next line attempts: `if key < 0:`
   - This tries to compare a **list** with an **integer**: `[0, 0] < 0`
   - In Python 3, this raises a **TypeError** because the `<` operator is not supported between list and int types

The TypeError is raised before any return value can be computed.
