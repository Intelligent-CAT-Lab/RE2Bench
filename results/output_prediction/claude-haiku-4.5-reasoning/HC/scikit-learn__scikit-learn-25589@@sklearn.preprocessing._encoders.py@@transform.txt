[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `transform` method with the given input where `X=None`.

1. First, `check_is_fitted(self)` is called. Since `n_features_in_` = 2 exists, the model is considered fitted and this passes.

2. Then `warn_on_unknown` is calculated:
   - `self.drop` = "first" (not None)
   - `self.handle_unknown` = "ignore" (which is in {'ignore', 'infrequent_if_exist'})
   - So `warn_on_unknown = True`

3. The method calls `self._transform(X, ...)` where X=None.

4. Inside `_transform`, it calls `self._check_n_features(X, reset=False)`.

5. Inside `_check_n_features`, it tries to call `_num_features(None)`:
   ```python
   def _num_features(X):
       # For X=None:
       if not hasattr(X, '__len__') and not hasattr(X, 'shape'):
           if not hasattr(X, '__array__'):
               raise TypeError('Unable to find the number of features from X of type builtins.NoneType')
   ```
   Since None has no `__len__`, `shape`, or `__array__` attributes, this raises a TypeError.

6. Back in `_check_n_features`, the TypeError is caught:
   ```python
   except TypeError as e:
       if not reset and hasattr(self, 'n_features_in_'):
           raise ValueError(f'X does not contain any features, but {self.__class__.__name__} is expecting {self.n_features_in_} features')
   ```
   
   Since:
   - `reset=False`
   - `hasattr(self, 'n_features_in_')=True` (n_features_in_=2)
   
   A ValueError is raised with the message: "X does not contain any features, but OneHotEncoder is expecting 2 features"

The function does not complete successfully; instead, a ValueError exception is raised.
