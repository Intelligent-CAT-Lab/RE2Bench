[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_complement(self, other)` with:
- `self` represented as `{}`  
- `other` is a FiniteSet with `_elements = frozenset({1})`

**Step 1: Determine the code path**

Looking at the `_complement` method, I need to check what type `other` is:
- `other` has `_elements` attribute with value `frozenset({1})`, so it's a FiniteSet
- The method will execute the `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):` branch

**Step 2: Execute the FiniteSet branch**

```python
def ternary_sift(el):
    contains = self.contains(el)
    return contains if contains in [True, False] else None
sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)
```

For each element in `other` (just element `1`), the code calls `self.contains(1)`.

**Step 3: Determine containment**

Since `self` is represented as empty `{}`, it doesn't contain element `1`. Therefore `self.contains(1)` returns a falsy value, which means element `1` belongs to `sifted[False]`.

Result of sifting:
- `sifted[False]` = `[1]` (elements not in self)
- `sifted[None]` = `[]` (empty, used here would be False)

**Step 4: Build the return value**

Since `sifted[None]` is falsy:
```python
Union(FiniteSet(1), S.EmptySet)
```

This is semantically the complement of an empty set within `{1}`, which equals `{1}`.

The Union simplifies/evaluates to `FiniteSet(1)`, which has `_elements = frozenset({1})`.

**Step 5: Format the output**

The result is a FiniteSet with `_elements = frozenset({1})`.
