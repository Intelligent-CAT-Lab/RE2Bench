[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the `_hstack` method execution with the given input:

1. **Input analysis:**
   - `self.sparse_output_` = `false` (Python: `False`)
   - `Xs` = `null` (Python: `None`)

2. **Execution flow:**
   - Since `self.sparse_output_` is `False`, we enter the `else` block
   - First line in the `else` block (line within the method):
     ```python
     Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
     ```
   - This attempts to iterate over `Xs` using a list comprehension: `for f in Xs`
   - Since `Xs` is `None`, Python cannot iterate over it

3. **Exception raised:**
   - When trying to iterate over `None` with `for f in None`, Python raises:
   ```
   TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
   ```

This exception is raised before the function can return any value. The function execution terminates with this error.
