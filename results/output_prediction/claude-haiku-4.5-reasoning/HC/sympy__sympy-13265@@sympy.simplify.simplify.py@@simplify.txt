Let me trace through the execution step-by-step:

1. **Input parsing**: The input string `"(\"exp(x)\" + \"exp(-x)\")/(y*(\"exp(x)\" - \"exp(-x)\"))"` when parsed as JSON becomes:
   - `(exp(x) + exp(-x))/(y*(exp(x) - exp(-x)))`

2. **sympify(expr)**: This converts the string to a SymPy expression representing:
   - `(exp(x) + exp(-x)) / (y * (exp(x) - exp(-x)))`

3. **Attempting _eval_simplify()**: The code tries the direct method first if available.

4. **Main simplification process**: Since the expression is an instance of `Mul` (division is represented as multiplication), it proceeds through various simplifications.

5. **Key simplification step**: The code reaches:
   ```python
   if short.has(TrigonometricFunction, HyperbolicFunction, ExpBase):
       short = exptrigsimp(short)
   ```
   Since the expression contains `ExpBase` (exp functions), `exptrigsimp` is called. This function is specifically designed to convert between exponential and hyperbolic/trigonometric forms.

6. **Mathematical simplification**: Using hyperbolic identities:
   - `exp(x) + exp(-x) = 2*cosh(x)`
   - `exp(x) - exp(-x) = 2*sinh(x)`
   
   The expression becomes:
   - `2*cosh(x) / (y * 2*sinh(x))` = `cosh(x) / (y*sinh(x))`

7. **Further reduction**: Since `coth(x) = cosh(x)/sinh(x)`, this simplifies to:
   - `coth(x) / y`

8. **Measure comparison**: Using `count_ops` as the measure, `coth(x)/y` has far fewer operations than the original exponential form, so it's selected as the shorter result.

The simplified expression is `coth(x)/y`.
