Let me trace through the execution of the `fit` method step by step.

**Step 1: Call to `fit`**
The `fit` method is called with:
- X = `[[1, nan], [0, 0]]` (2x2 array with NaN)
- y = None
- sample_weight = None

**Step 2: Call `_reset()`**
The `_reset()` method checks if `scale_` attribute exists. Since this is a fresh StandardScaler instance, it doesn't have these attributes yet, so nothing is deleted.

**Step 3: Call `partial_fit(...)`**
The `partial_fit` method is decorated with `@_fit_context`, which validates parameters and calls the actual method.

**Inside `partial_fit`:**

1. **Data validation:** X is validated and converted to a NumPy float array: `[[1., nan], [0., 0.]]`

2. **Initialization:** 
   - `first_call = True` (no `n_samples_seen_` attribute yet)
   - `n_features = 2` (X.shape[1])
   - `dtype = np.int64` (since sample_weight is None)
   - `self.n_samples_seen_ = [0, 0]` (initialized as int64 array)

3. **Non-sparse branch** (X is a regular array):
   - `self.mean_ = 0.0` (initial value)
   - `self.var_ = 0.0` (initial value, since with_std=True)

4. **Call `_incremental_mean_and_var`:**
   - For column 0: values [1, 0] → mean=0.5, var=0.25, n=2
   - For column 1: values [nan, 0] → only 0 is valid → mean=0.0, var=0.0, n=1
   - Result: `self.mean_ = [0.5, 0.0]`, `self.var_ = [0.25, 0.0]`, `self.n_samples_seen_ = [2, 1]`

5. **Check if all samples equal:** `max([2,1]) ≠ min([2,1])`, so n_samples_seen_ remains as array

6. **Compute scale:**
   - `_is_constant_feature` identifies column 1 as constant (var=0.0)
   - `self.scale_ = _handle_zeros_in_scale(√[0.25, 0.0], constant_mask=[False, True])`
   - Result: `self.scale_ = [0.5, 1.0]`

**Step 4: Return**
The `partial_fit` method returns `self` (the fitted StandardScaler object with parameters copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True).

The `fit` method then returns the result from `partial_fit`, which is the fitted StandardScaler instance.
