[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` with the given inputs.

The function signature is:
```python
def _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx):
```

From the input:
- `self._infrequent_enabled` = False
- `feature_idx` = 1
- `drop_idx` = "0"

Execution trace:

1. The function checks the first condition: `if not self._infrequent_enabled:`
   - `self._infrequent_enabled` = False
   - `not False` = True, so the condition is True

2. Since the condition is True, the function immediately returns `drop_idx`
   - The return statement is: `return drop_idx`
   - `drop_idx` = "0"

3. Therefore, the function returns "0"

The function doesn't proceed to the remaining code because the early return happens on the first condition.
