[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `fit` method:

1. `fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params)` is called where `fit_params = {'a': 0}`

2. The first line inside `fit` is:
   ```python
   transformers = self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one)
   ```

3. Inside `_parallel_func`, the first line is:
   ```python
   self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)
   ```

4. Since `self.transformer_list` is `None` (from the input), attempting to execute `list(None)` will raise:
   ```
   TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
   ```

5. This exception is raised before any assignment completes, so `self.transformer_list` remains unchanged.

6. The exception propagates up through the call stack, and the `fit` method does not complete successfully.

7. The object state remains as it was before fit was called.

Since an exception occurs during execution, the object state is not modified from its initial values. The attributes remain:
- transformer_list: None (null)
- n_jobs: None (null)
- transformer_weights: None (null)
- verbose: False (false)
