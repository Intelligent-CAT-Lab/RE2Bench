[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_fit` step by step:

1. **validate_data**: X and y are validated. X has shape (150, 2), y has 150 samples with classes 0, 1, 2.

2. **Extract n_features**: 
   - `n_features = X.shape[1] = 2`

3. **Determine n_features_to_select**:
   - `self.n_features_to_select = 4` (an Integral)
   - `n_features_to_select = 4`
   - Since `4 > 2` (n_features), a warning is issued: "Found n_features_to_select=4 > n_features=2. There will be no feature selection and all features will be kept."

4. **Determine step value**:
   - `0.0 < 0.1 < 1.0` is True
   - `step = int(max(1, 0.1 * 2)) = int(max(1, 0.2)) = int(1) = 1`

5. **Initialize arrays**:
   - `support_ = [True, True]` (2 features)
   - `ranking_ = [1, 1]`

6. **While loop**:
   - Condition: `np.sum(support_) > n_features_to_select` → `2 > 4` is False
   - The while loop does NOT execute

7. **After while loop**:
   - `features = [0, 1]` (all features remain)
   - `self.estimator_` is created by cloning and fitting the SVC estimator

8. **Set final attributes**:
   - `self.n_features_ = 2`
   - `self.support_ = [True, True]`
   - `self.ranking_ = [1, 1]`

9. **Return self**: The method returns the RFE instance

The `_fit` method returns `self` (the RFE instance). The properties accessed are:
- `self.estimator` - remains SVC(kernel='linear'), unchanged
- `self.n_features_to_select` - remains 4, unchanged
- `self.step` - remains 0.1, unchanged
- The estimator object has a kernel attribute with value 'linear'
