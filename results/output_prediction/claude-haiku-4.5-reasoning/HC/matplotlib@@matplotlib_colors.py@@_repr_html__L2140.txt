[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_repr_html_()` method step by step:

1. The method starts with: `png_bytes = self._repr_png_()`

2. Before `_repr_png_()` can return anything, it executes:
   ```python
   if not self._isinit:
       self._init()
   ```

3. From the input, `"_isinit": false`, so the condition `not self._isinit` evaluates to `not False` which is `True`.

4. Therefore, `self._init()` is called.

5. Looking at the `_init()` method definition:
   ```python
   def _init(self):
       raise NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')
   ```

6. Since `BivarColormap` is marked as an abstract class (only the base implementation is shown), calling `_init()` raises a `NotImplementedError` with the message 'Abstract class only'.

7. This exception is raised before `_repr_png_()` can complete and return any PNG bytes, so the entire `_repr_html_()` method fails at this point.

The function never completes successfully because it attempts to initialize an abstract class that is not meant to be instantiated directly.
