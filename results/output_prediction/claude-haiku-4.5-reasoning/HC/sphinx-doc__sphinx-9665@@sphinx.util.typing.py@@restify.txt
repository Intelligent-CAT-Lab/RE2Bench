[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `restify` with `cls = None`:

1. The function `restify(cls: Optional[Type]) -> str:` is called with `cls = None`
2. Execution enters the try block
3. The first condition checks: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`
   - Since `cls` is `None`, the condition `cls is None` evaluates to `True`
4. When this condition is `True`, the function immediately returns: `':py:obj:`None`'`
5. This is a string literal containing: `:py:obj:`None`` (with backticks as part of the reStructuredText markup)
6. The function returns this string without evaluating any other conditions

Since the first condition matches and returns, no exception occurs, so the except block is not executed.
