Let me trace through the `_get_kernel_params` method step by step:

1. `params = self.kernel_params`
   - self.kernel_params = null, so params = None

2. `if params is None:`
   - params is None, so we enter this block
   - `params = {}`
   - Now params is an empty dictionary

3. `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':`
   - self.kernel = "polynomial"
   - callable("polynomial") = False, so `not callable(self.kernel)` = True
   - "polynomial" != 'precomputed' = True
   - Both conditions are True, so we enter this if block

4. Inside the if block: `for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:`
   - KERNEL_PARAMS is imported from `.metrics.pairwise`
   - Based on sklearn's standard implementation, KERNEL_PARAMS["polynomial"] includes: ['degree', 'gamma', 'coef0']
   
   Iteration 1: param = "degree"
   - `if getattr(self, "degree") is not None:` → True (3.1 is not None)
   - `params["degree"] = 3.1`
   
   Iteration 2: param = "gamma"
   - `if getattr(self, "gamma") is not None:` → False (gamma is null/None)
   - Skip this
   
   Iteration 3: param = "coef0"
   - `if getattr(self, "coef0") is not None:` → True (0.1 is not None)
   - `params["coef0"] = 0.1`

5. The elif condition doesn't execute since we entered the if block

6. `return params`
   - Returns {"degree": 3.1, "coef0": 0.1}

{
    "coef0": 0.1,
    "degree": 3.1
