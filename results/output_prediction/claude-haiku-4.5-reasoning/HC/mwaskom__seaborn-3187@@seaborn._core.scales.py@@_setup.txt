[THOUGHT]
Looking at this code, I need to trace through the `_setup` method step by step:

1. `new = copy(self)` - Creates a shallow copy of the Scale object with its current attributes

2. `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()` - Since `_tick_params` is None in the input, the `tick()` method is called. This method is not provided in the code, but based on the structure and seaborn patterns, it should set up tick parameters. Without the implementation, I'll assume it returns a modified instance with tick params set (likely with default None values).

3. `if new._label_params is None: new = new.label()` - Similarly, since `_label_params` is None, the `label()` method is called, which should set up label parameters.

4. `forward, inverse = new._get_transform()` - Gets forward and inverse functions for the log transform (based on `trans: "log"`)

5. `mpl_scale = new._get_scale(str(data.name), forward, inverse)` - Creates a matplotlib scale object with data.name="ymax"

6. Since `axis is None`, a `PseudoAxis` is created and initialized.

7. The matplotlib scale's locators and formatters are set.

8. For the normalize function: The code checks `if prop.normed:`. Since `prop` only shows `"variable": "y"` without a `normed` attribute, this would be False/falsy, so `normalize = None`

9. `new._pipeline = [axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]` - Creates a pipeline list with 4 callable items

10. `new._spacer = spacer` - Assigns the spacer function

11. For `_legend`: The code checks `if prop.legend:`. Since this attribute isn't shown in prop, it's likely False, so `_legend` remains None

The original attributes (values, norm, trans) are copied but not modified by the method, so they remain as they were in the input.

For JSON representation of callable objects and methods (which can't be directly serialized), they would be represented as null or empty objects.
