[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__int__` method with the input `self = "1 + I"` (the SymPy complex number 1 + i).

Step 1: Check `if not self.is_number:`
- The `is_number` property checks if the expression has free symbols
- 1 + I is a complete number with no free symbols
- So `self.is_number` = True, and we don't raise here

Step 2: Check `if not self.is_comparable:`
- The `is_comparable` property returns True if "self can be computed to a real number (or already is a real number) with precision"
- The key phrase is "can be computed to a **real** number"
- 1 + I is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part
- It cannot be reduced or computed to a real number
- Therefore, `self.is_comparable` = False
- So `not self.is_comparable` = True

Since the second condition is True, the function executes:
```python
raise TypeError('Cannot convert non-comparable expression to int')
```

The function raises a TypeError before reaching any of the later logic.
