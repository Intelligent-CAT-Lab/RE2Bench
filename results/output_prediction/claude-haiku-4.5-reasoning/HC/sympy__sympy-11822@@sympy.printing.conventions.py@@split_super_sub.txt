[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `split_super_sub("Fvec")` step by step.

**Initial state:**
- text = "Fvec"
- len(text) = 4, which is > 0, so we continue
- pos = 0
- name = None
- supers = []
- subs = []

**While loop iteration (pos = 0):**
- start = pos + 1 = 1
- text[0:2] = "Fv" ≠ "__", so start stays 1
- pos_hat = text.find('^', 1) = -1 (no '^' found)
  - Since -1, set pos_hat = len(text) = 4
- pos_usc = text.find('_', 1) = -1 (no '_' found)
  - Since -1, set pos_usc = len(text) = 4
- pos_next = min(4, 4) = 4
- part = text[0:4] = "Fvec"
- pos = 4
- Since name is None: name = "Fvec"

**Loop condition check:**
- pos < len(text) → 4 < 4 → False, exit loop

**Regex matching:**
- Pattern `_name_with_digits_p` is `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$` which matches letters followed by digits
- "Fvec" contains only letters, no digits at the end
- m = _name_with_digits_p.match("Fvec") = None (no match)

**Return:**
- Since m is None (falsy), skip the if block
- return (name, supers, subs) = ("Fvec", [], [])
