[THOUGHT]

Let me trace through the execution of `exptrigsimp` with the input `expr = "sinh(x) + cosh(x)"`.

First, I need to consider what happens when this string is passed to the function. However, the function is designed to work with SymPy expression objects. Let me assume the string input represents a SymPy expression: `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`.

1. Initial call: `exptrigsimp(sinh(x) + cosh(x))`

2. First step - `newexpr = bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)`:
   - The `bottom_up` function traverses the expression tree from leaves to root
   - For each sub-expression, `exp_trig` is called, which:
     - Creates choices: original expression, expression rewritten in exponential form, expression rewritten in cosine form
     - Returns the option with minimum `count_ops`
   - For `sinh(x)` alone: count_ops is likely 1 (just the function)
   - For `(exp(x) - exp(-x))/2`: count_ops would be much higher
   - So individual `sinh(x)` and `cosh(x)` likely remain unchanged
   - For the sum `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`: The rewrite to exp form `(exp(x) - exp(-x))/2 + (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2` has more operations than the original (which has count ~3)

3. Second step - `newexpr = bottom_up(newexpr, f)`:
   - Function `f` only processes `Mul` expressions
   - Since `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` is an `Add` expression, it returns unchanged

4. Third step - `if newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction)`:
   - This is True, so:
   - `e, f = hyper_as_trig(newexpr)` and `newexpr = f(TR2i(e))`
   - These functions apply hyperbolic simplifications
   - The identity `sinh(x) + cosh(x) = e^x` should be recognized

5. Final steps check for trig functions and imaginary units, then return the simplified expression

Since `sinh(x) + cosh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2 + (e^x + e^{-x})/2 = e^x`, the function should simplify the expression to `exp(x)`.

The output structure requests `"nargs"` with `"_elements"`, which appears to be asking for a representation of the result. The most reasonable interpretation is to represent the simplified expression.
