Let me trace through the execution of the `fit` method step by step.

Given inputs:
- `self.estimators` = `null` (None)
- `self.voting` = "hard"
- `self.weights` = `null` (None)
- `self.n_jobs` = `null` (None)
- `self.flatten_transform` = `true`
- `self.le_.classes_` = "[0 1 2]"
- `self.classes_` = "[0 1 2]"
- X = iris dataset (150 samples × 4 features)
- y = iris labels
- `sample_weight` = `null` (None)

Executing the `fit` method:

```python
def fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):
    if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
        raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')
```

The first condition checks: `self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0`

Since `self.estimators` is `null` (None), the first part of the OR condition (`self.estimators is None`) evaluates to `True`. 

Therefore, the condition is `True`, and the code immediately raises:
```
AttributeError: Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples
```

An exception is raised before any other code in the method executes. This means:
- `estimators_` attribute is never created
- `named_estimators_` attribute is never created
- All other attributes remain unchanged from their initial state

The method does not complete successfully - it raises an AttributeError at the validation check.
