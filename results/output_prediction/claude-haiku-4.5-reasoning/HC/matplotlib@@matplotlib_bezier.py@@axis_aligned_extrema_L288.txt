[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `axis_aligned_extrema` method step by step.

Given input:
- `_N = 1`
- `_d = 2`
- `_cpoints` is a numpy array with shape (1, 2)

Execution:

1. First line: `n = self.degree`
   - The `degree` property returns `self._N - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - So `n = 0`

2. Next line: `if n <= 1:`
   - Check: `0 <= 1` evaluates to `True`
   - This condition is met immediately

3. Since the condition is true, the function returns early:
   - `return (np.array([]), np.array([]))`
   - This returns a tuple of two empty numpy arrays

Since the degree is 0 (representing just a single point, not a curve), there are no extrema to find, so empty arrays are returned.

When converting to JSON format, numpy arrays are represented as lists, so the tuple of two empty arrays becomes `[[], []]`.
