[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `get_weight` method:

1. The method `get_weight` is defined as:
```python
def get_weight(self):
    return self._weight
```

2. This is a simple getter method that returns the `_weight` attribute of the object.

3. From the input, we can see that `self._weight` is set to `"normal"` (a string value).

4. Therefore, calling `get_weight()` simply returns the value of `self._weight`, which is `"normal"`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "normal"
}
```
