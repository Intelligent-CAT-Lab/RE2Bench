[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of this function step by step.

Given inputs:
- nums = [1, 2, 3]
- pop1 = 2
- pop2 = 4

Execution:

1. Initial state: nums = [1, 2, 3]

2. First operation: `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)` = `nums.pop(2 - 1)` = `nums.pop(1)`
   - This removes the element at index 1 from the list
   - Index 1 in [1, 2, 3] contains the value 2
   - After this pop operation: nums = [1, 3]

3. Second operation: `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)` = `nums.pop(4 - 1)` = `nums.pop(3)`
   - This attempts to remove the element at index 3
   - However, nums is now [1, 3], which only has 2 elements (valid indices are 0 and 1)
   - Index 3 is out of bounds
   - This will raise an IndexError: list index out of range

The function will not complete successfully due to this index out of range error on the second pop operation.
