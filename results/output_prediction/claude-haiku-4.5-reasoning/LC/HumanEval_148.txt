[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given inputs:
- planet1 = "Earth"
- planet2 = "Earth"

Execution:

1. `planet_names = ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')`
   This creates a tuple of planet names.

2. Check the if condition:
   ```
   if planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2:
   ```
   
   - `planet1 not in planet_names`: "Earth" IS in planet_names, so this is False
   - `planet2 not in planet_names`: "Earth" IS in planet_names, so this is False
   - `planet1 == planet2`: "Earth" == "Earth" is True
   
   Since the third condition `planet1 == planet2` evaluates to True, the entire if condition is True.

3. Since the condition is True, the function executes:
   ```
   return ()
   ```
   and returns an empty tuple.

The function never reaches the remaining code that calculates indices and slices, because it returns early with an empty tuple.
