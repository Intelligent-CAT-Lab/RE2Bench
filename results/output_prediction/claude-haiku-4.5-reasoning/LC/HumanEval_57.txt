[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `monotonic` takes a list `l` as input.
The input is: `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`

The function checks two conditions:
1. `l == sorted(l)` - checks if the list equals the sorted version (ascending order)
2. `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` - checks if the list equals the reverse sorted version (descending order)

Let's evaluate:
1. `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` returns `[9, 9, 9, 9]`
   So `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]` is `True`

2. Since the first condition is `True` and we have an `or` operator, the overall condition evaluates to `True`

3. The function returns `True`

A list of all identical elements is considered monotonic because it satisfies both the non-decreasing (ascending) and non-increasing (descending) conditions.
