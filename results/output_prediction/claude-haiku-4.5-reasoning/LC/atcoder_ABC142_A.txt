[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

1. `N = int(input())` - The input is "99", so N = 99

2. `if N % 2 == 0:` - Check if N is even
   - 99 % 2 = 1, which is not equal to 0, so the condition is False

3. Since the condition is False, we execute the else branch:
   - `print((N + 1) / N / 2)`
   - Substitute N = 99: (99 + 1) / 99 / 2
   - = 100 / 99 / 2
   - = (100 / 99) / 2
   - = 1.0101010101010102 / 2 (due to floating point precision)
   - = 0.5050505050505051

4. The print statement outputs this floating point number.
