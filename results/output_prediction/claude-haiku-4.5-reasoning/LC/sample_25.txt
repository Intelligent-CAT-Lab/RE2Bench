[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution step by step.

The function `f(d)` is called with:
```
d = {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}
```

Step 1: `d = d.copy()`
- This creates a shallow copy of the input dictionary
- `d` is now a separate dictionary: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`

Step 2: `d.popitem()`
- This removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary
- In Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order, so `popitem()` removes the last inserted item
- The last item in the dictionary is `("x:", 3)`, so it gets removed
- After this operation, `d` becomes `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`

Step 3: `return d`
- The function returns the modified dictionary `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`

So the output dictionary has two keys: "l" with value 1, and "t" with value 2.
