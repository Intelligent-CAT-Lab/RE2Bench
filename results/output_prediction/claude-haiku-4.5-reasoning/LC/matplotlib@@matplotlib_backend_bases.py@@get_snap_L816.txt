[THOUGHT]
1. The function `get_snap` is called with `self` as the GraphicsContextBase instance.
2. Looking at the input, the `self` object has property `_snap` which is set to `null`.
3. The function simply returns `self._snap`.
4. Since `self._snap = null`, the function returns `null`.
5. In JSON format, Python's `None` is represented as `null`.
