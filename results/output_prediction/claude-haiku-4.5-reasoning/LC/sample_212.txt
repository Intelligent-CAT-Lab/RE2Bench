[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

The input list is: `nums = [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

The function is:
```python
def f(nums):
    for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
        nums.reverse()
    return nums
```

First, let's determine how many iterations the loop runs:
- `len(nums)` = 7
- `len(nums) - 1` = 6
- So the loop runs 6 times

Now let me trace through each reverse operation:

Initial: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`

Iteration 1 (1st reverse): `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

Iteration 2 (2nd reverse): `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Iteration 3 (3rd reverse): `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

Iteration 4 (4th reverse): `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Iteration 5 (5th reverse): `[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]`

Iteration 6 (6th reverse): `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]` (back to original)

Since reversing twice returns a list to its original state, and we perform an even number of reverses (6), the list returns to its original state.

The function returns: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`
