[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `add_event` method step by step.

1. The `add_event` method is called with:
   - self.events is a list containing 1 event
   - event parameter is the new event to add

2. The method executes:
   ```
   self.events.append(event)
   ```
   This appends the new event to the self.events list.

3. After execution, self.events will contain 2 events (the original one plus the newly added one).

4. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns `None` implicitly.

The output of the method is `None`, which in JSON format is represented as `null`.
