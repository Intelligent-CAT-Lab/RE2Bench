[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method step by step with the given input.

The method is:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, Model):
        return NotImplemented
    if self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model:
        return False
    my_pk = self.pk
    if my_pk is None:
        return self is other
    return my_pk == other.pk
```

Given:
- `self`: A Model instance with id=1
- `other`: Another Model instance with id=1
- Both have identical structure and the same primary key

Execution flow:

1. `if not isinstance(other, Model):` 
   - `other` is a Model instance, so this is False. Continue.

2. `if self._meta.concrete_model != other._meta.concrete_model:`
   - Both are instances of the same Model class with identical structure
   - `self._meta.concrete_model == other._meta.concrete_model`
   - This condition is False. Continue.

3. `my_pk = self.pk`
   - For a Django model, accessing the `pk` property calls `_get_pk_val()`
   - `_get_pk_val()` returns `getattr(self, meta.pk.attname)`
   - From the input, `self` has `"id": 1`
   - So `my_pk = 1`

4. `if my_pk is None:`
   - `my_pk` is 1 (not None)
   - This condition is False. Continue.

5. `return my_pk == other.pk`
   - `my_pk = 1`
   - `other.pk = 1` (from the input, other also has id=1)
   - `1 == 1` evaluates to True
   - Return True
