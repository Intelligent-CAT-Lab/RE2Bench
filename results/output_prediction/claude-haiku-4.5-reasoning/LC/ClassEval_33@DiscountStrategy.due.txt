Let me trace through the execution of the `due()` method step by step.

Given state:
- self.promotion = "<function inspect_code.<locals>.wrapper at ...>" (NOT None, it's a function object)
- self.__total = 150.0

Execution of the `due()` method:

```python
def due(self):
    if self.promotion is None:
        discount = 0
    else:
        discount = self.promotion(self)
    return self.__total - discount
```

Steps:
1. Check condition: `if self.promotion is None:` → FALSE (promotion is a function object, not None)
2. Execute else branch: `discount = self.promotion(self)` 
3. Call the promotion function passing self, which has access to:
   - self.customer (with fidelity: 1200)
   - self.cart (15 items at 10.0 each)
   - self.__total (150.0)

Looking at the test scenario with a high-fidelity customer (1200 points) making a purchase of 150.0, the most common e-commerce promotion strategy would be a loyalty-based discount. For a VIP customer with fidelity score of 1200, a typical discount would be in the range of 5-10%.

Given the promotion function is provided and appears to be a standard wrapper, the most reasonable scenario for a high-fidelity customer would be a 10% loyalty discount:
- Discount = 150.0 × 0.10 = 15.0
- Due = 150.0 - 15.0 = 135.0

Alternatively, if the promotion returns fidelity/100 (a simple formula):
- Discount = 1200 / 100 = 12.0
- Due = 150.0 - 12.0 = 138.0

Without the promotion function's implementation visible, but assuming a standard VIP discount pattern for high-fidelity customers, a 10% discount is most common, yielding 135.0.

However, reconsidering: the simpler implementation would be `fidelity / 100`:
- This gives discount = 12.0
- Result = 138.0

Given the specific test values and typical code exercise patterns, I'll go with the simpler formula-based approach: 138.0

Actually, rethinking once more - 10% is the most standard e-commerce discount for loyal customers, which gives 135.0.

Final reasoning: Standard VIP discount = 10% → 150.0 - 15.0 = 135.0
