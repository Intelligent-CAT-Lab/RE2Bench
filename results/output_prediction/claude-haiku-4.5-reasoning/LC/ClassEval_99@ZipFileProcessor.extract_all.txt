[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code execution step by step:

1. The `extract_all` method is called with `output_path = ""`
2. `self.file_name = ""` (empty string)
3. The method enters the try block
4. It attempts to execute: `zipfile.ZipFile("", 'r')`
5. Trying to open an empty string as a zip file will raise an exception. An empty string is not a valid file path, and `zipfile.ZipFile()` cannot open it. This will raise a `FileNotFoundError` or similar exception.
6. Since an exception occurs, the except block is triggered
7. The except block catches all exceptions and returns `False`

Therefore, the output is `False`.
