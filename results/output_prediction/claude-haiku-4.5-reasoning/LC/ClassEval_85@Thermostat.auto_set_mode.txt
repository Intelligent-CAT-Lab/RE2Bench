[THOUGHT]
Let's execute `auto_set_mode` step by step.

Initial state:
- self.current_temperature = 25
- self.target_temperature = 25
- self.mode = "cool"

Execution:
1. The condition `if self.current_temperature < self.target_temperature:` is evaluated
   - Is 25 < 25? No, this is False
   
2. Since the condition is False, the else branch executes:
   - `self.mode = 'cool'`
   - The mode is set to 'cool' (it was already 'cool')

3. The method has no explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns None

The method modifies the state of the object but doesn't return any value.
