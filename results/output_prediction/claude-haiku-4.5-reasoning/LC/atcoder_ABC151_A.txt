[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

The code is:
```python
print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))
```

Looking at the input JSON:
```json
{
    "input": "\"a\""
}
```

In JSON notation, `\"` represents an escaped double-quote character. So the string value `"\"a\""` would represent a literal three-character string containing: `"a"` (quote, letter a, quote).

However, `ord()` function expects a single character string, not a multi-character string. If we passed a 3-character string to `ord()`, it would raise a TypeError.

Given that the problem format expects normal output rather than an error, I'll interpret this as: the JSON encoding is being used for display purposes, but the actual input passed to the program is the single character `a`. This is a reasonable interpretation since `ord()` is being used.

With input `a`:
1. `input()` returns the string `"a"` (single character)
2. `ord("a")` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97
3. 97 + 1 = 98
4. `chr(98)` returns the character with ASCII value 98, which is `"b"`
5. `print("b")` outputs `b`
