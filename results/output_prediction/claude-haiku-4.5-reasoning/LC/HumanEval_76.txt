[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_simple_power` step by step with the inputs x=1 and n=1:

1. The function is called with parameters x=1 and n=1
2. First, we check the condition `if n == 1:`
   - Since n = 1, this condition is True
3. When n == 1, we execute `return x == 1`
   - We evaluate x == 1
   - Since x = 1, this comparison evaluates to True
4. The function returns True immediately without executing the while loop

So the return value is True.
