[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the skewness function step by step with data = [1, 1, 1].

1. n = len(data) = 3

2. mean = sum(data) / n = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.0

3. variance = sum(((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data)) / n
   - For each x in [1, 1, 1]: (1 - 1)^2 = 0, (1 - 1)^2 = 0, (1 - 1)^2 = 0
   - sum = 0
   - variance = 0 / 3 = 0.0

4. std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance) = math.sqrt(0.0) = 0.0

5. Now for the skewness calculation:
   - We have a conditional expression: `... if std_deviation != 0 else 0`
   - Since std_deviation = 0.0, the condition `std_deviation != 0` is False
   - Therefore, the else clause is executed: skewness = 0

6. return 0
