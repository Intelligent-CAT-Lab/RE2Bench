[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. The input string is "74 74" (after JSON unescaping)
2. `input().split()` splits this by whitespace, giving ["74", "74"]
3. `map(int, ["74", "74"])` converts to integers
4. `S, W = 74, 74` assigns the values
5. The condition check: `if S <= W`
6. Since S = 74 and W = 74, the condition `74 <= 74` is **True**
7. When the condition is True, it executes `print('unsafe')`
8. Therefore, the output will be: "unsafe"
