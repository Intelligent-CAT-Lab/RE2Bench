[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `update_product_quantity(product_id=1, quantity=-3)` is called
2. The method checks `if product_id in self.inventory:`
   - `product_id = 1` (an integer)
   - `self.inventory = {"1": {"name": "product 1", "quantity": 2}}`
   - The dictionary has a string key `"1"`, not an integer key `1`
   - In Python, `1 in {"1": ...}` checks for the integer key `1`, which does not exist
   - The condition evaluates to `False`
3. Since the condition is `False`, the if block does not execute
4. The method has no explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`

The method does not modify any state and returns `None`.
