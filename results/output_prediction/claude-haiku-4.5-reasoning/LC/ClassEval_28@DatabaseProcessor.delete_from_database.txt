[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `delete_from_database`:

1. The function is called with:
   - self.database_name = "test.db"
   - table_name = "test_table"
   - name = "Alice"

2. `conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)` - Connects to "test.db"

3. `cursor = conn.cursor()` - Creates a cursor object

4. `delete_query = f'DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?'` - Constructs the query: "DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?"

5. `cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))` - Executes the DELETE query with name parameter "Alice"

6. `conn.commit()` - Commits the transaction to the database

7. `conn.close()` - Closes the database connection

8. The function does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns `None`.
