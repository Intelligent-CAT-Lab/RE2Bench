[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function execution step by step.

Given:
- `num = [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` (the input list)

Function execution:
1. `num.append(num[-1])` - This appends the last element of the list to itself
   - `num[-1]` accesses the last element of the list, which is `1`
   - `num.append(1)` adds `1` to the end of the list
   - After this operation, `num` becomes `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`

2. `return num` - The function returns the modified list

So the output is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`
