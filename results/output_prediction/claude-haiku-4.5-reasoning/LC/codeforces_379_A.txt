[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is `"80 970"`, so after `map(int, input().split())`:
- `a = 80`
- `b = 970`

Initial state:
- `x = a = 80`
- `h = 0`
- `s = 0`

**First while loop:** `while x > 0:`
```
while x > 0:
    x -= 1
    h += 1
    s += 1
```
This loop continues while x > 0. Each iteration:
- x decreases by 1
- h increases by 1  
- s increases by 1

Since x starts at 80, this loop executes exactly 80 times.

After the first loop:
- `x = 0`
- `h = 80`
- `s = 80`

**Second while loop:** `while s // b != 0:`
```
while s // b != 0:
    h += 1
    s = s - b + 1
```

The condition checks if `s // b != 0`. With s = 80 and b = 970:
- `s // b = 80 // 970 = 0` (integer division, since 80 < 970)

So `0 != 0` evaluates to False, and the second while loop doesn't execute at all.

Final value: `h = 80`

The code prints h, which is 80.
