[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `decimal_to_binary` with the input `decimal = 0`.

1. The function receives `decimal = 0`
2. `bin(0)` converts the decimal number 0 to its binary representation. In Python, `bin(0)` returns the string `'0b0'` (where '0b' is a prefix indicating binary)
3. `bin(0)[2:]` slices the string starting from index 2, which removes the first 2 characters ('0b'). So `'0b0'[2:]` results in `'0'`
4. The function concatenates: `'db' + '0' + 'db'`
5. The final result is `'db0db'`
