[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. `x = int(input())` - This reads the input from console and converts it to an integer. The input is "1", so `x = 1`.
2. `if x == 1:` - This checks if x equals 1. Since x is indeed 1, the condition evaluates to True.
3. Since the condition is True, the code executes `print(0)`, which outputs 0 to the console.
4. The else branch is not executed.

So the output will be `0`.
