[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `clean_non_binary_chars` method.

Given input:
- self.binary_string = "01101000011011010110001001101111"

The method executes:
```python
def clean_non_binary_chars(self):
    self.binary_string = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string))
```

This filters the binary_string to keep only characters that are in '01' (i.e., '0' or '1').

Checking the input string "01101000011011010110001001101111":
- All characters are already either '0' or '1'
- So all characters pass the filter

After filtering: "01101000011011010110001001101111" (remains unchanged)

This filtered result is assigned to self.binary_string.

Important: The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns None (implicitly).

The "output" in the structure refers to the return value of the function call, which is None.
