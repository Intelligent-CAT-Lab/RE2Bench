[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

1. The `generate_email_pattern` method is called on a `RegexUtils` instance with no additional arguments.
2. Inside the method, a string variable `pattern` is assigned the value: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`
3. This is a string literal with escaped backslashes:
   - `\\b` in the source code represents the literal string `\b` (one backslash, one 'b')
   - `\\.` in the source code represents the literal string `\.` (one backslash, one dot)
4. The function simply returns this pattern string.

The returned string will be: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
}
