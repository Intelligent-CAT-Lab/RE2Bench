[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step:

1. Input: `array = [1, 2, 1]`

2. `new_array = array.copy()` 
   Creates a shallow copy of the array, so `new_array = [1, 2, 1]`

3. `new_array = reversed(new_array)`
   The `reversed()` function returns a reverse iterator object. It will iterate through the elements in reverse order.
   The original array [1, 2, 1] reversed would be [1, 2, 1] (it's a palindrome, so reversing it yields the same sequence).

4. `return [x * x for x in new_array]`
   The list comprehension iterates through the reverse iterator and squares each element:
   - First element: 1 * 1 = 1
   - Second element: 2 * 2 = 4
   - Third element: 1 * 1 = 1
   
   Result: [1, 4, 1]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [1, 4, 1]
}
```
