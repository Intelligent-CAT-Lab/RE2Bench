[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

Input: "2.4"

1. `num = input().split('.')`
   - `input()` returns "2.4"
   - `.split('.')` splits the string by the dot character
   - `num = ["2", "4"]`

2. `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
   - `num[0]` is "2" (the first element)
   - `num[0][-1]` is the last character of "2", which is "2"
   - `int("2")` equals 2
   - `2 == 9` is False
   - This condition is not met

3. `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
   - `num[1]` is "4" (the second element)
   - `num[1][0]` is the first character of "4", which is "4"
   - `int("4")` equals 4
   - `4 >= 5` is False
   - This condition is not met

4. `else:`
   - Since both if and elif conditions are False, we execute the else block
   - `print(num[0])` prints the value of `num[0]`
   - `num[0]` is "2"
   - Output: "2"
