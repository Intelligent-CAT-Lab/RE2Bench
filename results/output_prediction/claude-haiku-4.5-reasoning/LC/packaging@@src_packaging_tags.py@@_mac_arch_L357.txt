[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_mac_arch` with the given inputs:

Function signature:
```python
def _mac_arch(arch: str, is_32bit: bool=_32_BIT_INTERPRETER) -> str:
```

Given inputs:
- `arch = "x86_64"`
- `is_32bit = true`

Step-by-step execution:

1. The function is called with `arch="x86_64"` and `is_32bit=True`

2. First condition: `if not is_32bit:`
   - `is_32bit = True`, so `not True = False`
   - This condition is False, so we don't return early

3. Second condition: `if arch.startswith('ppc'):`
   - Check if `"x86_64".startswith('ppc')`
   - This is False since "x86_64" does not start with "ppc"
   - This condition is False, so we don't return here

4. Execute final line: `return 'i386'`
   - Since both conditions were False, we reach the final return statement
   - The function returns the string `'i386'`
