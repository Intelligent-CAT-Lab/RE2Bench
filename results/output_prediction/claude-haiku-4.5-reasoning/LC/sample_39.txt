[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the function `f(array, elem)` step by step.

Given inputs:
- array = [6, 2, 7, 1]
- elem = 6

Execution:
1. The function checks `if elem in array:`
   - We need to check if 6 is in the list [6, 2, 7, 1]
   - Yes, 6 is present in the array
   
2. Since the condition is True, we execute `return array.index(elem)`
   - array.index(6) returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of 6 in the array
   - Looking at the array [6, 2, 7, 1], the value 6 is at index 0
   - So array.index(6) returns 0

3. The function returns 0
