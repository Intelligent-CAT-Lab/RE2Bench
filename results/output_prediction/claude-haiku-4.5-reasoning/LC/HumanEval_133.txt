Let me trace through the execution of `sum_squares` step by step.

The function is given:
```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        squared += math.ceil(i) ** 2
    return squared
```

With input `lst = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`

Execution trace:

1. Initialize: `squared = 0`

2. First iteration: `i = -1.4`
   - `math.ceil(-1.4) = -1` (ceiling of -1.4 is -1)
   - `(-1) ** 2 = 1`
   - `squared = 0 + 1 = 1`

3. Second iteration: `i = 17.9`
   - `math.ceil(17.9) = 18`
   - `18 ** 2 = 324`
   - `squared = 1 + 324 = 325`

4. Third iteration: `i = 18.9`
   - `math.ceil(18.9) = 19`
   - `19 ** 2 = 361`
   - `squared = 325 + 361 = 686`

5. Fourth iteration: `i = 19.9`
   - `math.ceil(19.9) = 20`
   - `20 ** 2 = 400`
   - `squared = 686 + 400 = 1086`

6. Return `squared = 1086`
