[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

1. The SQLGenerator object has table_name = "table1"
2. The select method is called with:
   - fields = None (not provided in args or kwargs)
   - condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20" (from kwargs)

3. In the select method:
   - fields is None, so: fields = '*'
   - sql = f'SELECT * FROM table1'
   - condition is not None (it's "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"), so:
   - sql += f' WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'
   - sql becomes 'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'
   - Finally, return sql + ';' which adds a semicolon

The output will be: "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
</THOUGHT>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
}
```
