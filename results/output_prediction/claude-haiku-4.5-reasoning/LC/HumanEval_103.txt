Let me execute this function step by step with `n=185` and `m=546`.

1. First check: Is `m < n`? Is `546 < 185`? No, so we proceed.

2. Initialize `summation = 0`

3. Loop through `range(n, m + 1)`, which means `range(185, 547)`:
   - We sum all integers from 185 to 546 (inclusive)
   - Using the arithmetic series formula: sum = (first + last) * count / 2
   - count = m - n + 1 = 546 - 185 + 1 = 362
   - sum = (185 + 546) × 362 / 2 = 731 × 181 = 132,311

4. Calculate the average:
   - average = 132,311 / 362
   - 132,311 ÷ 362 ≈ 365.549...

5. Round the average:
   - round(365.549...) = 366
   - (Since 0.549 > 0.5, it rounds up)

6. Convert to binary using `bin()`:
   - bin(366) converts 366 to its binary representation
   - 366 in binary is 101101110
   - Python's bin() function returns the string with '0b' prefix
   - So bin(366) = '0b101101110'

Let me verify the binary: 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 366 ✓
