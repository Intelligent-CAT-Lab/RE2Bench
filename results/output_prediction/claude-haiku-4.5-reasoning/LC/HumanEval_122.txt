[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add_elements` function step by step.

Given inputs:
- `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `k = 4`

Execution:
1. `arr[:k]` → `arr[:4]` gives us the first 4 elements: `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`

2. The generator expression filters elements where `len(str(elem)) <= 2`:
   - `111`: `str(111) = "111"`, length = 3. Is `3 <= 2`? No, excluded.
   - `21`: `str(21) = "21"`, length = 2. Is `2 <= 2`? Yes, included.
   - `3`: `str(3) = "3"`, length = 1. Is `1 <= 2`? Yes, included.
   - `4000`: `str(4000) = "4000"`, length = 4. Is `4 <= 2`? No, excluded.

3. The filtered elements are: `[21, 3]`

4. `sum([21, 3])` = `21 + 3 = 24`

The function returns `24`.
