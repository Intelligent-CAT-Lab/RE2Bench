[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_bored` with the input `S = "bIt"`.

1. `sentences = re.split('[.?!]\\s*', S)`
   - The regex pattern `'[.?!]\\s*'` matches a period (.), question mark (?), or exclamation mark (!), followed by zero or more whitespace characters.
   - We're trying to split the string `"bIt"` using this pattern.
   - Since `"bIt"` contains no periods, question marks, or exclamation marks, there are no delimiters to split on.
   - Therefore, `re.split()` returns the original string as a single-element list: `["bIt"]`

2. `return sum((sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences))`
   - This is a generator expression that iterates over each sentence in the `sentences` list.
   - For each sentence, it checks if the first 2 characters equal the string `'I '` (capital I followed by a space).
   - For the only sentence `"bIt"`:
     - `sentence[0:2]` = `"bI"` (the first two characters of "bIt")
     - `"bI" == 'I '` evaluates to `False`
   - The generator yields one value: `False`
   - `sum([False])` treats `False` as `0`, so the result is `0`

The function returns `0`.
