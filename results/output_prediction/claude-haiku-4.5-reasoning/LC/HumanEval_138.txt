[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function step by step.

1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes parameter `n` with value `10`
2. The function returns: `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`
3. Let me evaluate this expression with `n = 10`:
   - First condition: `10 % 2 == 0`
     - 10 % 2 = 0 (the remainder when 10 is divided by 2)
     - 0 == 0 evaluates to `True`
   - Second condition: `10 >= 8`
     - 10 >= 8 evaluates to `True`
   - Combined: `True and True` = `True`
4. The function returns `True`
