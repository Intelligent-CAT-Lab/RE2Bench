[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_gpa("Charlie")` step by step:

1. The method is called with `name="Charlie"`
2. Check the condition: `if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:`
   - First part: `"Charlie" in self.students` → TRUE (Charlie is a key in the students dict)
   - Second part: `self.students["Charlie"]['courses']` → `{"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}` → This is a non-empty dict, which is truthy → TRUE
3. Both conditions are true, so we execute:
   `return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])`
4. Calculate:
   - `self.students["Charlie"]['courses'].values()` returns the values: [70, 80]
   - `sum([70, 80])` = 150
   - `len(self.students["Charlie"]['courses'])` = 2 (Charlie has 2 courses)
   - `150 / 2` = 75.0

Therefore, the output is 75.0
