[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

First, I need to interpret the input. The JSON shows `"input": "\"1 1 1\""`. The escaped quotes `\"` in JSON represent literal quote characters, but in the context of how this problem is presented, I'll interpret the intended input as the string `1 1 1` (three space-separated numbers). This is the most reasonable interpretation for this type of problem.

1. `k, n, w = map(int, input().strip().split())`
   - `input()` returns the string `"1 1 1"`
   - `.strip()` removes leading/trailing whitespace: `"1 1 1"`
   - `.split()` splits by whitespace: `["1", "1", "1"]`
   - `map(int, ...)` converts each to int: k=1, n=1, w=1

2. `sum = 0`
   - Initialize sum to 0

3. `for i in range(1, w + 1):`
   - Since w=1, this is `range(1, 2)` which gives [1]
   - Loop runs once with i=1

4. `sum += k * i`
   - When i=1: sum += 1 * 1
   - sum becomes 0 + 1 = 1

5. `if sum <= n:`
   - Check if 1 <= 1 (True)
   - Since condition is True, execute `print(0)`

6. The output is: `0`
