Let me trace through the Euclidean algorithm step by step.

The function implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.

Initial state: a = 10, b = 15

Iteration 1:
- while b: (15 is truthy, so we enter the loop)
- a, b = (b, a % b) = (15, 10 % 15) = (15, 10)
- Now a = 15, b = 10

Iteration 2:
- while b: (10 is truthy, so we continue)
- a, b = (b, a % b) = (10, 15 % 10) = (10, 5)
- Now a = 10, b = 5

Iteration 3:
- while b: (5 is truthy, so we continue)
- a, b = (b, a % b) = (5, 10 % 5) = (5, 0)
- Now a = 5, b = 0

Iteration 4:
- while b: (0 is falsy, so we exit the loop)

Return a = 5

The greatest common divisor of 10 and 15 is 5 (since 10 = 2 × 5 and 15 = 3 × 5).
