[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `load_image` method is called with `image_path = "/home/changshu/ClassEval/data/benchmark_solution_code/test.png"`

2. Inside `load_image`, the code does:
   ```python
   self.image = Image.open(image_path)
   ```
   This opens the image from the file path and stores it in `self.image`.

3. However, the method does not have an explicit `return` statement. In Python, when a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`.

4. Therefore, the output of calling `load_image` is `None`.
