[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__format_line_feed` method step by step.

1. The method signature is `__format_line_feed(text)` and it's a static method.
2. Input: `text = "Some sentence here."`
3. The method executes: `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)`
   - `re.compile('\\n+')` creates a regex pattern that matches one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`)
   - `re.sub()` replaces all occurrences of this pattern with a single newline `'\n'`
4. Looking at the input text "Some sentence here." - there are no newline characters (`\n`) present in this string.
5. Since the regex pattern `\\n+` doesn't match anything in the text, no replacement occurs.
6. The function returns the text unchanged: "Some sentence here."
