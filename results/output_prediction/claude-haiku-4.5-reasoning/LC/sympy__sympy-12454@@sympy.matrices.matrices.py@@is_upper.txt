[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `is_upper` property step by step:

```python
@property
def is_upper(self):
    return all((self[i, j].is_zero for i in range(1, self.rows) for j in range(min(i, self.cols))))
```

Given input:
- `self.rows = 4`
- `self.cols = 4`
- `self._mat = null` (None)

The `is_upper` property checks if all elements **below** the main diagonal are zero (which is the definition of an upper triangular matrix).

The generator expression iterates:
- `i` in `range(1, 4)` = [1, 2, 3]
- For each `i`, `j` in `range(min(i, 4))`:
  - i=1: j in range(1) = [0] → checks self[1, 0]
  - i=2: j in range(2) = [0, 1] → checks self[2, 0], self[2, 1]
  - i=3: j in range(3) = [0, 1, 2] → checks self[3, 0], self[3, 1], self[3, 2]

This iterates over all elements in the lower triangular part (below the diagonal).

For a matrix with rows=4 and cols=4, even though `_mat` is None in the representation, the matrix dimensions are defined. In the context of SymPy matrices, when initialized or accessed with defined dimensions, elements that haven't been explicitly set are typically considered as 0 (zeros).

For a zero matrix (or default-initialized matrix):
- All elements checked: `self[i,j]` for positions below diagonal are all zero
- For zero elements: `.is_zero` returns `True`
- `all([True, True, True, True, True, True])` returns `True`

A matrix of all zeros is indeed upper triangular (elements below the diagonal are all zero).
