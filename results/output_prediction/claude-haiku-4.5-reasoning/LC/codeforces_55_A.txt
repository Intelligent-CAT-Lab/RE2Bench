[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step with the input "9".

1. `n = int(input())` reads the input "9" and converts it to integer. So n = 9.

2. `while n % 2 == 0:` checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., if n is even).
   - n = 9, and 9 % 2 = 1 (not equal to 0), so the condition is False.
   - The while loop body does not execute, and we skip to the if statement.

3. `if n == 1:` checks if n equals 1.
   - n = 9, which is not equal to 1, so the condition is False.
   - We proceed to the else branch.

4. `print('NO')` executes and prints "NO".

This program is checking if a number is a power of 2 by repeatedly dividing by 2. If it reaches 1, it's a power of 2 (prints YES); otherwise, it prints NO. Since 9 is not a power of 2, the output is NO.
