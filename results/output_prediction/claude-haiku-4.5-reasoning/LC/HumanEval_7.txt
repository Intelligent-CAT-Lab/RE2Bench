[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `filter_by_substring` function with the given inputs.

The function is:
```python
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
```

Given:
- `strings`: ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- `substring`: "run"

This function returns a list comprehension that keeps only those strings where the substring "run" appears as a substring.

Let me check each string:

1. "grunt" - Does "run" appear in it? g-r-u-n-t contains "r-u-n" at positions 1-3. Yes, "run" is in "grunt"!
2. "trumpet" - Does "run" appear in it? t-r-u-m-p-e-t. We have "r-u" but the next character is "m", not "n". So no "run".
3. "prune" - Does "run" appear in it? p-r-u-n-e contains "r-u-n" at positions 1-3. Yes, "run" is in "prune"!
4. "gruesome" - Does "run" appear in it? g-r-u-e-s-o-m-e. We have "r-u" but the next character is "e", not "n". So no "run".

Therefore, the filtered list contains: ["grunt", "prune"]

```
{
    "output": ["grunt", "prune"]
