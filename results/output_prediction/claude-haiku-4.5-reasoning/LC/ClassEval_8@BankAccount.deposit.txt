[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution:

1. We have a BankAccount instance with self.balance = 0
2. The deposit method is called with amount = 300
3. First, we check if amount < 0: Is 300 < 0? No, so no ValueError is raised.
4. Then we update the balance: self.balance += amount → self.balance = 0 + 300 = 300
5. Finally, we return self.balance, which is 300

Therefore, the deposit method returns 300.
