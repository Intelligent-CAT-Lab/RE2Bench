[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the `heal` method step by step:

1. The object is initialized with `hp = 100`
2. The `heal` method is called with no arguments
3. First line of `heal`: `self.hp += 10` → `self.hp = 100 + 10 = 110`
4. Next, we check the condition: `if self.hp > 100:` → `if 110 > 100:` → This is True
5. Since the condition is True, we execute: `self.hp = 100`
6. Finally, we `return self.hp` → return 100

The method returns the current hp value after healing, which is capped at 100 maximum.
