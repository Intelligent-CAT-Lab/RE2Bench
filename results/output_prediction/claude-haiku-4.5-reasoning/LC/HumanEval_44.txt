[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `change_base` function step by step.

Input:
- x = 4
- base = 5

Initial state:
- ret = ''
- x = 4

**Iteration 1:**
- Condition: x > 0 → 4 > 0 → True
- x % base = 4 % 5 = 4 (the remainder when 4 is divided by 5)
- str(x % base) = str(4) = '4'
- ret = '4' + '' = '4'
- x //= base → x = 4 // 5 = 0

**Iteration 2:**
- Condition: x > 0 → 0 > 0 → False
- Loop condition is false, so we exit the while loop

Return ret = '4'

The function converts a decimal number to the specified base. In this case, converting decimal 4 to base 5 gives us '4' since 4 is less than 5 and is represented as a single digit in base 5.
