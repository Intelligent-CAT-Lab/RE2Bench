[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution step by step:

1. The function `double_the_difference` takes a list as input.
2. From the input, `lst = []` (an empty list)
3. The function evaluates the list comprehension: `[i ** 2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and ('.' not in str(i))]`
4. Since `lst` is empty, the iteration `for i in lst` will not execute any iterations (there are no elements to iterate over)
5. The list comprehension produces an empty list: `[]`
6. `sum([])` returns `0` (the sum of an empty list is 0 by default)
7. The function returns `0`
