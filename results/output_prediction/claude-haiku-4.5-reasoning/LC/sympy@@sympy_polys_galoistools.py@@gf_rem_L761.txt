[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `gf_rem`:

1. `gf_rem` simply calls `gf_div(f, g, p, K)` and returns the second element of the tuple (the remainder).

2. Now tracing through `gf_div` with:
   - f = [2, 0]
   - g = [1, 0, 1]
   - p = 3
   - K = ZZ

3. In the dense polynomial representation used by sympy's galoistools:
   - f = [2, 0] represents 2x + 0 (length 2, so degree 1)
   - g = [1, 0, 1] represents x^2 + 0x + 1 (length 3, so degree 2)

4. Calculate degrees:
   - df = gf_degree(f) = len([2, 0]) - 1 = 1
   - dg = gf_degree(g) = len([1, 0, 1]) - 1 = 2

5. Check conditions:
   - `if not g:` is False (g is non-empty)
   - `elif df < dg:` is True (1 < 2)

6. Since df < dg (the dividend has lower degree than the divisor), the function returns:
   - quotient q = []
   - remainder r = f = [2, 0]
   - Returns: ([], [2, 0])

7. `gf_rem` returns the second element of the tuple: [2, 0]
