[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add_heading` method step by step.

Given input:
- self.file_path = "test_example.docx"
- heading = "Test Heading 5"
- level = 1 (default value, since kwargs is empty)

The `add_heading` method executes:
1. It enters a try block
2. It attempts to open a Document at "test_example.docx" using `Document(self.file_path)`
3. Since "test_example.docx" is not provided in the test environment, this file does not exist
4. `Document()` from the python-docx library will raise a FileNotFoundError when trying to open a non-existent file path
5. The exception is caught by the bare `except:` clause
6. The method returns False

Therefore, since the file doesn't exist, an exception occurs, gets caught, and the function returns False.
