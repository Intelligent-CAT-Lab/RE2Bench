[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this step by step.

The function calls `re.split(pattern, text)` where:
- pattern: "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b"
- text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

The pattern matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX with word boundaries:
- \b = word boundary
- \d{3} = exactly 3 digits
- - = literal hyphen
- \d{3} = exactly 3 digits
- - = literal hyphen
- \d{4} = exactly 4 digits
- \b = word boundary

Let me identify matches in the text:
1. "123-456-7890" - matches (start has word boundary, end has word boundary before space)
2. "876-286-9876" - matches (space before is word boundary, space after is word boundary)
3. "987-762-9767" - matches (space before is word boundary, end of string is word boundary)

When `re.split()` splits on these matches (with no capturing groups), it removes the matched portions and returns the text between them:
- Before first match: "" (empty, at start)
- Between first and second match: " abiguygusu "
- Between second and third match: " kjgufwycs "
- After third match: "" (empty, at end)

Result: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]

{
    "output": ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]
