[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

Given:
- text = "g"
- n = 15

Step 1: Check the condition `if len(text) <= 2:`
- len("g") = 1
- Is 1 <= 2? Yes, this condition is True

Step 2: Since the condition is True, the function immediately executes the return statement:
- `return text`
- This returns "g"

The function exits early and never reaches the lines that calculate `leading_chars` or the final return statement.

Therefore, the output is "g".

{
    "output": "g"
