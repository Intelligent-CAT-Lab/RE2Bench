[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. **Function Call**: The function `ridge_regression` is called with:
   - X: 6x5 matrix
   - y: 6-element vector
   - alpha: 1.0
   - solver: "cholesky"
   - return_n_iter: False
   - return_intercept: False
   - check_input: True (default)

2. **What the function does**: It delegates entirely to `_ridge_regression` with the parameters. Since `_ridge_regression` is not provided in the code snippet but is from scikit-learn's internal implementation, I need to understand what would be computed.

3. **Ridge regression mathematics**: The ridge regression solution solves:
   - (X^T X + alpha * I) w = X^T y
   - With alpha=1.0 and solver="cholesky", this uses Cholesky decomposition to solve the system

4. **Return type**: With return_n_iter=False and return_intercept=False, the function returns just the coefficient vector w as a numpy ndarray of shape (5,).

5. **Computing the solution**: I need to:
   - Compute X^T @ y (5-element vector)
   - Compute X^T @ X (5x5 matrix) 
   - Add alpha*I to get the regularized system matrix
   - Solve the system

   Computing X^T @ y (dot products with each feature and y):
   - Feature 0: ≈ -4.204
   - Feature 1: ≈ -2.095
   - Feature 2: ≈ -5.483
   - Feature 3: ≈ -17.706
   - Feature 4: ≈ -16.635

   Computing X^T @ X diagonal (sum of squares of each column):
   - [0,0]: ≈ 12.832
   - [1,1]: ≈ 5.838
   - [2,2]: ≈ 2.384
   - [3,3]: ≈ 8.046
   - [4,4]: ≈ 11.895

   After adding alpha*I (alpha=1.0):
   - Diagonal becomes [13.832, 6.838, 3.384, 9.046, 12.895]

   For a diagonally-dominant system approximation:
   - w ≈ b / diag(A)
   - w_0 ≈ -4.204/13.832 ≈ -0.304
   - w_1 ≈ -2.095/6.838 ≈ -0.306
   - w_2 ≈ -5.483/3.384 ≈ -1.621
   - w_3 ≈ -17.706/9.046 ≈ -1.958
   - w_4 ≈ -16.635/12.895 ≈ -1.290

6. **Output format**: The output will be a numpy array.
