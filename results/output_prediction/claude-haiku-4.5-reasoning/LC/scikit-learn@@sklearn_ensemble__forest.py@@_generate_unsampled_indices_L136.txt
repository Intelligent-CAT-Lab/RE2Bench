Let me trace through this step by step:

1. `_generate_unsampled_indices(random_state=209652396, n_samples=150, n_samples_bootstrap=150)` is called.

2. First, `_generate_sample_indices(209652396, 150, 150)` is called:
   - Creates `random_instance = check_random_state(209652396)`, which returns `np.random.RandomState(209652396)`
   - Calls `random_instance.randint(0, 150, 150, dtype=np.int32)`
   - This generates 150 random integers from [0, 150) using the seeded random generator
   - The seed 209652396 produces a deterministic sequence

3. `sample_counts = np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=150)`:
   - Counts how many times each index (0-149) appears in the sample_indices
   - Returns an array of length 150 with occurrence counts

4. `unsampled_mask = sample_counts == 0`:
   - Creates a boolean array where True indicates indices with count 0
   - Will be True for indices that were never sampled

5. `indices_range = np.arange(150)`:
   - Creates [0, 1, 2, ..., 149]

6. `unsampled_indices = indices_range[unsampled_mask]`:
   - Selects indices where the boolean mask is True
   - Returns numpy array of unsampled indices

**Key insight**: With 150 bootstrap samples from 150 items (sampling with replacement), statistically approximately 36-37% of items won't be sampled (related to the coupon collector problem). This means roughly 54-56 indices should be unsampled.

The exact sequence depends on the random numbers generated by seed 209652396. For this specific seed, the random sampling process will result in an array of approximately 50-60 indices from 0-149 that were not selected in the 150 bootstrap samples. These indices would be the ones with zero count in the bincount array.
