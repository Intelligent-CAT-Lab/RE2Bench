[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

The `subtract` method is a static method that takes two complex numbers as arguments.

Given input:
- c1 = -1 + 2j (complex number)
- c2 = -3 + 4j (complex number)

The method performs:
1. real = c1.real - c2.real
   - c1.real = -1
   - c2.real = -3
   - real = (-1) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2

2. imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag
   - c1.imag = 2
   - c2.imag = 4
   - imaginary = 2 - 4 = -2

3. return complex(2, -2)
   - This creates a complex number 2 - 2j

In Python, when converted to string representation for output, complex(2, -2) becomes "(2-2j)".

{
    "output": "(2-2j)"
