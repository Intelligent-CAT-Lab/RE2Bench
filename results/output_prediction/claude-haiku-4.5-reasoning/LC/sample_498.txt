[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

The function `f` takes three parameters:
- `nums`: a list [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
- `idx`: 2
- `added`: 3

Key operation: `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)`

This is a slice assignment where:
- `nums[idx:idx]` creates an empty slice at position `idx`
- When you assign to an empty slice, it inserts the elements at that position

With `idx = 2`:
- `nums[2:2]` is an empty slice at index 2 (between index 1 and 2)
- `nums[2:2] = (3,)` inserts the value 3 at index 2

Original list: [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
After insertion at index 2:
- Index 0: 2 (unchanged)
- Index 1: 2 (unchanged)
- Index 2: 3 (newly inserted)
- Index 3: 3 (shifted from index 2)
- Index 4: 2 (shifted from index 3)
- Index 5: 3 (shifted from index 4)
- Index 6: 3 (shifted from index 5)

Result: [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]

The function returns `nums`, which is now the modified list.
