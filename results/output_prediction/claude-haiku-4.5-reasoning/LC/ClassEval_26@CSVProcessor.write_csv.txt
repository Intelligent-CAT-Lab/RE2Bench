[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `write_csv` method:

1. The method is called with:
   - data = [["a", "b", "c", "d"], ["ME"]]
   - file_name = "read_test_process.csv"

2. It enters a try block:
   - Opens the file "read_test_process.csv" in write mode with newline=''
   - Creates a csv.writer object
   - Calls writer.writerows(data) which writes both rows:
     - First row: ["a", "b", "c", "d"] → writes "a,b,c,d"
     - Second row: ["ME"] → writes "ME"
   - The file context manager exits and closes the file
   - No exception occurs

3. The method then returns 1 (indicating success)

The data format is valid (list of lists), the filename is a valid string, and assuming normal file system permissions, the operation should succeed without raising any exception.
