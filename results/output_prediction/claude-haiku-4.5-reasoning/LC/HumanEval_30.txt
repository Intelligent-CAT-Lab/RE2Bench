[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as parameter.
2. The input list is `l = [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`
3. The function uses a list comprehension: `[e for e in l if e > 0]`
4. This iterates through each element `e` in the list and includes it in the result only if the condition `e > 0` is true.

Let me check each element:
   - `e = -1`: Is `-1 > 0`? No, skip
   - `e = -2`: Is `-2 > 0`? No, skip
   - `e = 4`: Is `4 > 0`? Yes, include 4
   - `e = 5`: Is `5 > 0`? Yes, include 5
   - `e = 6`: Is `6 > 0`? Yes, include 6

5. The function returns `[4, 5, 6]`
