Let me trace through the `_jaccard` function step by step.

The function takes four boolean arrays. Looking at the input, let me parse the arrays:

a_rows: Array with True at indices: 1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 14, 27 → 7 True values
a_cols: Array with True at indices: 4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 22, 25, 29 → 8 True values
b_rows: Array with True at indices: 1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 14, 27 → 7 True values (same as a_rows)
b_cols: Array with True at indices: 4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 22, 25, 29 → 8 True values (same as a_cols)

Notice that a_rows == b_rows and a_cols == b_cols (they are identical).

Now computing step by step:

Step 1: Calculate intersection
- (a_rows * b_rows).sum() = Since a_rows == b_rows, element-wise multiplication gives a_rows itself = 7
- (a_cols * b_cols).sum() = Since a_cols == b_cols, element-wise multiplication gives a_cols itself = 8
- intersection = 7 * 8 = 56

Step 2: Calculate a_size
- a_rows.sum() = 7
- a_cols.sum() = 8
- a_size = 7 * 8 = 56

Step 3: Calculate b_size
- b_rows.sum() = 7
- b_cols.sum() = 8
- b_size = 7 * 8 = 56

Step 4: Calculate Jaccard
- jaccard = 56 / (56 + 56 - 56)
- jaccard = 56 / 56
- jaccard = 1.0

Since the two sets are identical, the Jaccard similarity is 1.0.
