[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step:

1. The method `construct_stop_word_list` is called on an instance with no arguments (besides self).
2. Inside the method:
   - A local variable `stop_word_list` is created and initialized with the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`
   - The method immediately returns this list
3. So the function returns `['a', 'an', 'the']`

In JSON format, this is a list with three string elements.

    "output": ["a", "an", "the"]
