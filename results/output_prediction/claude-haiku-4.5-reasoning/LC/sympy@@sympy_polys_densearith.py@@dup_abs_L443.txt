[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `dup_abs`:

1. The function signature is: `def dup_abs(f: dup[Eabs], K: Domain[Eabs]) -> dup[Eabs]:`

2. Inputs:
   - `f = [2]` (a list with a single integer coefficient)
   - `K = "ZZ"` (represents the integer domain in SymPy)

3. The function executes a list comprehension: `[K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]`

4. Iteration:
   - Loop through f: `coeff = 2`
   - Call `K.abs(coeff)` where K is the integer domain (ZZ)
   - `K.abs(2)` applies the absolute value function of the integer domain to 2
   - Since 2 is positive, `abs(2) = 2`

5. The list comprehension creates a new list: `[2]`

6. This list is returned as the output.
