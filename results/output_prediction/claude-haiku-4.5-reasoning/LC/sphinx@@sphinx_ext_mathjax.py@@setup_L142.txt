[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `setup` function execution:

1. The function `setup(app: Sphinx) -> ExtensionMetadata` is called with a Sphinx application object
2. The function body calls several methods on `app`:
   - `app.add_html_math_renderer()` - registers math renderers
   - Multiple `app.add_config_value()` - registers configuration values
   - `app.connect()` - connects an event listener
3. These method calls modify the app's state but don't affect the return value
4. The function returns a dictionary:
   ```python
   return {'version': sphinx.__display_version__, 'parallel_read_safe': True}
   ```

The return statement has two keys:
- `'parallel_read_safe'`: This is a literal boolean value `True`
- `'version'`: This is `sphinx.__display_version__`, which is the version string of the imported Sphinx module

The value of `sphinx.__display_version__` depends on which version of Sphinx is installed. Looking at the code characteristics:
- It uses `from types import NoneType` (Python 3.10+ feature)
- It uses modern type hints and Sphinx API features
- It references `ExtensionMetadata` and modern Sphinx infrastructure
- The code appears to be from Sphinx 7.x (released 2023)

Based on typical Sphinx distributions and the modern nature of this code, the version would likely be a 7.x release. A reasonable estimate for a stable version would be something like 7.1.2 or similar.

The `parallel_read_safe` value is clearly `True` as a boolean literal.
