[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `check_in` method step by step.

Given:
- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}
- room_type = "single"
- room_number = 2
- name = "guest 1"

Execution:

1. First condition: `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`
   - room_type = "single"
   - self.booked_rooms.keys() = dict_keys(['single'])
   - "single" not in dict_keys(['single']) evaluates to False
   - So we do NOT return False here and continue

2. Second condition: `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`
   - name = "guest 1"
   - self.booked_rooms[room_type] = self.booked_rooms["single"] = {} (empty dictionary)
   - "guest 1" in {} evaluates to False
   - So we do NOT enter this if block

3. After the second if block, there is no explicit return statement or any other code, so the function implicitly returns None.
