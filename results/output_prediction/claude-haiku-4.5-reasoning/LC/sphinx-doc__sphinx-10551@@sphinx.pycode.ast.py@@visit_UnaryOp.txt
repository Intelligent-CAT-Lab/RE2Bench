[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `visit_UnaryOp` step by step:

1. The method receives a `UnaryOp` node with:
   - `node.op`: An operator node (empty dict `{}` in JSON, which represents an `ast.Invert` operator for the `~` operator)
   - `node.operand`: A constant node with value `1`

2. Check the condition: `isinstance(node.op, ast.Not)`
   - The operator is `Invert` (from code `~1`), not `Not` (which would be from `not`)
   - So this condition is False

3. Execute the else block (second return statement):
   ```python
   return '%s%s' % (self.visit(node.op), self.visit(node.operand))
   ```

4. `self.visit(node.op)`:
   - The `visit()` method dispatches to the appropriate visitor method based on node type
   - For an `Invert` operator node, this would call `visit_Invert()` (if it exists in the full implementation)
   - This would return the string representation `'~'`

5. `self.visit(node.operand)`:
   - For a Constant node with value `1`, this would call `visit_Constant()` or `visit_Num()`
   - This would return the string representation `'1'`

6. The format string results in:
   ```python
   '%s%s' % ('~', '1') = '~1'
   ```

The output is the string `'~1'`, which matches the original code represented by this AST node.
