[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function step by step.

The function is:
```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
```

Given inputs:
- game = [1, 2, 3, 5]
- guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]

Step-by-step execution:

1. `zip(game, guess)` creates pairs of corresponding elements:
   - (1, -1)
   - (2, 2)
   - (3, 3)
   - (5, 4)

2. For each pair (x, y), we compute `abs(x - y)`:
   - abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(2) = 2
   - abs(2 - 2) = abs(0) = 0
   - abs(3 - 3) = abs(0) = 0
   - abs(5 - 4) = abs(1) = 1

3. The list comprehension collects all these absolute differences into a list: [2, 0, 0, 1]

The return value is [2, 0, 0, 1].
