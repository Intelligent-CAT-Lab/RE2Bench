[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_cmp_name` function step by step.

Given:
- x = ImaginaryUnit (the class)
- y = Pi (the class)

Step 1: Extract class names
```python
n1 = x.__name__  # "ImaginaryUnit"
n2 = y.__name__  # "Pi"
```

Step 2: Check if names are equal
```python
if n1 == n2:
    return 0
```
"ImaginaryUnit" != "Pi", so we continue.

Step 3: Check if y is NOT a subclass of Basic
```python
if not issubclass(y, Basic):
    return -1
```
In SymPy, Pi is a subclass of Basic (it's a mathematical constant). So `issubclass(y, Basic)` is True, meaning `not issubclass(y, Basic)` is False. We don't return here and continue.

Step 4: Try to find indices in ordering_of_classes
Since `ordering_of_classes` is not provided in the code, and both ImaginaryUnit and Pi are specialized numeric constants (not in typical predefined ordering lists), both attempts to find their indices will raise ValueError, setting both i1 and i2 to UNKNOWN.

Step 5: Fall back to string comparison
```python
if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN:
    return (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)
```

Now comparing the strings:
- n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"
- n2 = "Pi"
- Comparing alphabetically: 'I' (ASCII 73) vs 'P' (ASCII 80)
- 'I' < 'P', so "ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi"

Therefore:
- (n1 > n2) = False (which equals 0)
- (n1 < n2) = True (which equals 1)
- Return (False) - (True) = 0 - 1 = -1
