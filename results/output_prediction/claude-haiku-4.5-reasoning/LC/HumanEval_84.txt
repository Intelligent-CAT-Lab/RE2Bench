[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step with N = 147.

Step 1: Convert N to a string
str(147) = "147"

Step 2: Create a generator expression that converts each character digit to an integer
(int(i) for i in str(147)) generates:
- int('1') = 1
- int('4') = 4
- int('7') = 7

Step 3: Sum these integers
sum((int(i) for i in str(147))) = 1 + 4 + 7 = 12

Step 4: Convert the sum to binary using bin()
bin(12) returns the string "0b1100"
(The "0b" prefix indicates it's a binary representation)

Step 5: Slice from index 2 onwards to remove the "0b" prefix
"0b1100"[2:] = "1100"

Therefore, the return value is "1100"
