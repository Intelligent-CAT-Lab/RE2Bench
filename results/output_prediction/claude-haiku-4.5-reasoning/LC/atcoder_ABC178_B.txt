Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is: `"193944314 586260100 -192321079 95834122"`

After `input().split()`, we get individual strings that are converted to integers:
- a = 193,944,314
- b = 586,260,100  
- c = -192,321,079
- d = 95,834,122

Now we calculate:
`ans = max(a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d)`

Let me evaluate each product:
- `a * c = 193944314 × (-192321079)` = negative
- `a * d = 193944314 × 95834122` = positive
- `b * c = 586260100 × (-192321079)` = negative
- `b * d = 586260100 × 95834122` = positive

Since the first and third products are negative, the maximum must be either `a * d` or `b * d` (both positive).

Since b > a and both are multiplied by the same positive d:
`b * d > a * d`

So the maximum is `b * d = 586260100 × 95834122`

Let me calculate this carefully:
- 586260100 × 95000000 = 586260100 × 95 × 1,000,000
  - 586260100 × 95 = 58,626,010,000 - 2,931,300,500 = 55,694,709,500
  - So: 55,694,709,500,000,000

- 586260100 × 834122 = 586260100 × (800000 + 34122)
  - 586260100 × 800000 = 586260100 × 8 × 100,000
    - 586260100 × 8 = 4,690,080,800
    - So: 469,008,080,000,000
  - 586260100 × 34122 = 586260100 × (30000 + 4122)
    - 586260100 × 30000 = 17,587,803,000,000
    - 586260100 × 4122 = 2,416,564,132,200
    - So: 20,004,367,132,200
  - Total: 469,008,080,000,000 + 20,004,367,132,200 = 489,012,447,132,200

Final result:
55,694,709,500,000,000 + 489,012,447,132,200 = 56,183,721,947,132,200
