[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method step-by-step:

1. The method first checks `if isinstance(other, CheckConstraint):`
   - From the input, `other` is indeed a CheckConstraint instance, so this condition is True.

2. Since the condition is True, the method evaluates:
   ```
   self.name == other.name and self.check == other.check and 
   (self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code) and 
   (self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message)
   ```

3. Let me evaluate each comparison:
   - `self.name == other.name`: 
     - "price" == "price" → **True**
   
   - `self.check == other.check`:
     - Both have: {"children": null, "connector": "AND", "negated": false}
     - These are Q objects with identical structure → **True**
   
   - `self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code`:
     - "custom_code" == "custom_code" → **True**
   
   - `self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message`:
     - Both have the same structure: {"_proxy____args": ["Constraint \u201c%(name)s\u201d is violated."], "_proxy____kw": {}}
     - These are lazy translation objects with identical content → **True**

4. The final result is: True and True and True and True = **True**
