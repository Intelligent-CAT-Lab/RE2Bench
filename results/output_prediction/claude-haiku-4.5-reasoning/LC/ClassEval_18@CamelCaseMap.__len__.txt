[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `CamelCaseMap` object is initialized with `_data = {}` (an empty dictionary).
2. The `__len__` method is called on this instance.
3. `__len__` returns `len(self._data)`.
4. Since `self._data = {}`, we need to compute `len({})`.
5. The length of an empty dictionary is 0.

Therefore, the output will be 0.
