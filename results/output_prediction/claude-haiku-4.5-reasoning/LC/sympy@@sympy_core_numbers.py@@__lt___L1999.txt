[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step:

1. We're calling `__lt__` on an Integer object representing 3, with the parameter `other` = 1

2. In the `__lt__` method:
   ```python
   def __lt__(self, other):
       try:
           other = _sympify(other)
       except SympifyError:
           return NotImplemented
       if other.is_Integer:
           return _sympify(self.p < other.p)
       return Rational.__lt__(self, other)
   ```

3. First, `other = _sympify(1)` is called:
   - This calls `sympify(1, strict=True)` which converts 1 to an Integer object: `Integer(1)`
   - No SympifyError is raised

4. Next, we check `if other.is_Integer:`:
   - `Integer(1).is_Integer` is `True`, so we enter this branch

5. Then we execute `return _sympify(self.p < other.p)`:
   - `self.p` is the numerator of `Integer(3)`, which is `3`
   - `other.p` is the numerator of `Integer(1)`, which is `1`
   - So we evaluate: `3 < 1` which is `False` (Python boolean)
   - Then `_sympify(False)` is called, which returns `False`

6. The function returns `False`
