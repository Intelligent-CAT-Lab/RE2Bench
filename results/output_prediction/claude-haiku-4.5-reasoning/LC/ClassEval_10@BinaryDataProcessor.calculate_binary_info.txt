[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `calculate_binary_info` method step by step.

Given input:
- binary_string: "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111"

Step 1: Count the zeroes
Looking through the string character by character:
"0110100001100101011011000110110001101111"

Let me count the '0's:
Positions with 0: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 32, 35
That's 19 zeroes.

Step 2: Count the ones
ones_count = total_length - zeroes_count

Step 3: Get total_length
len("0110100001100101011011000110110001101111") = 40 characters

Step 4: Calculate percentages
- zeroes_count = 19
- ones_count = 40 - 19 = 21
- total_length = 40
- zeroes_percentage = 19 / 40 = 0.475
- ones_percentage = 21 / 40 = 0.525

Step 5: Return the dictionary
{'Zeroes': 0.475, 'Ones': 0.525, 'Bit length': 40}
</THOUGHT>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "Zeroes": 0.475,
    "Ones": 0.525,
    "Bit length": 40
}
```
