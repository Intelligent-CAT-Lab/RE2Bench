[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `string_sequence(n=10)` step by step.

1. The function takes `n = 10` as input.
2. Inside the function: `range(n + 1) = range(10 + 1) = range(11)` which generates integers from 0 to 10 (inclusive).
3. The list comprehension `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]` converts each integer in this range to a string:
   - This produces: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
4. `' '.join(...)` joins all these string elements with a space as separator:
   - This produces: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'
5. The function returns this string.
