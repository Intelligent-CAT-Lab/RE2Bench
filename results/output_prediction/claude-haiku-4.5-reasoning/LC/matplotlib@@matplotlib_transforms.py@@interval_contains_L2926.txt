[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `interval_contains`:

1. The function is called with:
   - `interval` = `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]` (interpreted from the array notation as a sequence with two values)
   - `val` = `-80.0`

2. Line `a, b = interval` unpacks the interval:
   - `a = -107.73502692`
   - `b = -7.73502692`

3. Line `if a > b:` checks if `-107.73502692 > -7.73502692`
   - On a number line: -107.73502692 is to the left of -7.73502692
   - So `-107.73502692 > -7.73502692` is **False**
   - The swap does not occur

4. Line `return a <= val <= b` evaluates to:
   - `return -107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692`
   - This is equivalent to: `(-107.73502692 <= -80.0) and (-80.0 <= -7.73502692)`
   
   First condition: `-107.73502692 <= -80.0` 
   - Since -107.73502692 is more negative (further left), this is **True**
   
   Second condition: `-80.0 <= -7.73502692`
   - Since -80.0 is more negative (further left), this is **True**
   
   Both conditions are true, so the result is **True**

5. The function returns `True`
