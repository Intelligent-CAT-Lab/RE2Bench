[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. `n = int(input())` → n = 8
2. `i, j = (1, n * n)` → i = 1, j = 8 * 8 = 64
3. The while loop runs while `i < j`:
   - Each iteration: prints the current values of i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1
   - The gap between i and j decreases by 2 each iteration (i+1, j-1)
   
4. Initial gap: 64 - 1 = 63
   The loop continues until i >= j. 
   After k iterations: i = 1 + k, j = 64 - k
   Loop ends when 1 + k >= 64 - k, which gives 2k >= 63, so k >= 31.5
   
   This means 32 iterations (k = 0 to 31 runs 32 times)
   
5. Final iteration before loop closes:
   - When i = 32, j = 33: 32 < 33 is True, so we print "32 33"
   - Then i = 33, j = 32
   - When checking i = 33, j = 32: 33 < 32 is False, loop stops

The output will be 32 lines, starting from "1 64" and ending at "32 33":
