[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `add_book` function step by step.

Initial state:
- self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}
- title = "book2"
- quantity = 1 (default value, since no quantity is provided in kwargs)

Execution:
1. Check if title is in self.inventory: "book2" in {"book1": 2, "book2": 1} → True
2. Since the condition is True, execute: self.inventory[title] += quantity
3. self.inventory["book2"] += 1
4. self.inventory["book2"] = 1 + 1 = 2
5. The inventory is now {"book1": 2, "book2": 2}

The function has no explicit return statement, so it returns None implicitly.
