[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `is_prime` function with `n = 13441`.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for k in range(2, n - 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Step 1: Check if `n < 2`
- `13441 < 2` is False, so we continue.

Step 2: Loop through `range(2, 13440)` (i.e., k = 2, 3, 4, ..., 13439)
- For each k, we check if `13441 % k == 0`
- If any k divides 13441 evenly, we return False
- If no k divides 13441, the loop completes and we return True

To determine the output, I need to find if 13441 is prime or composite.

Let me check divisibility by small primes:
- √13441 ≈ 116, so I only need to check divisors up to ~116
- 13441 is odd (not divisible by 2)
- Sum of digits: 1+3+4+4+1 = 13, not divisible by 3
- Doesn't end in 0 or 5 (not divisible by 5)
- 13441 ÷ 7 = 1920.14... (not divisible)
- 13441 ÷ 11 = 1220.09... (not divisible)
- 13441 ÷ 13 = 1033.15... (not divisible)

After checking prime factors up to the square root of 13441 (which is approximately 116), none of them divide 13441 evenly. The next prime after 113 is 127, which exceeds √13441.

Since 13441 has no prime factors ≤ √13441, it is a prime number.

Therefore, the loop will iterate through all values from 2 to 13439 without finding any divisor. The function will return True.
