[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. `stdin = input()` reads the input string. The input provided is `"BBA"` (including the quote characters as they appear in the JSON escaped format `\"BBA\"`).
   So `stdin = '"BBA"'` (a string containing the literal quote characters, B, B, A, and another quote)

2. `s = stdin`, so `s = '"BBA"'`

3. Now we evaluate the condition: `'A' in s and 'B' in s`
   - `'A' in s`: Is the character 'A' in the string `"BBA"`? Yes, it's present.
   - `'B' in s`: Is the character 'B' in the string `"BBA"`? Yes, it's present (twice).
   - So `True and True` evaluates to `True`

4. Since the condition is `True`, `result = 'Yes'`

5. `print(result)` outputs `Yes`
