[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this step by step:

1. The `write_xml` method is called with:
   - `self.root = None`
   - `file_name = ""` (empty string)

2. In the try block:
   - `tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root)` attempts to create an ElementTree with `None` as the root element
   - Then `tree.write(file_name)` attempts to write to a file with an empty string as the filename

3. Attempting to write to a file with an empty string filename will raise an exception (likely `FileNotFoundError` or similar, since "" is not a valid filename).

4. The exception is caught by the `except:` clause, which is a bare except that catches all exceptions.

5. The function returns `False`.
