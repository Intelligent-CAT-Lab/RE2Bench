[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_new` method step by step:

1. The method is called with:
   - `cls`: ImmutableDenseNDimArray
   - `iterable`: A matrix-like object with rows=2, cols=2, _mat=null
   - `shape`: null
   - `kwargs`: {}

2. First line calls: `shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)`
   - Since `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` is not defined in the provided code (it's inherited from a parent class), I need to infer its behavior
   - Given the input is a 2x2 matrix structure (rows=2, cols=2) with shape=null, the method would infer shape=(2, 2)
   - Since _mat is null, the flat_list would be empty: []

3. Next, the code executes:
   - `shape = Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))` → shape becomes Tuple(2, 2)
   - `flat_list = flatten(flat_list)` → flattens the empty list → []
   - `flat_list = Tuple(*flat_list)` → converts to Tuple() (empty tuple since flat_list is empty)

4. Then it sets instance attributes:
   - `self._shape = shape` → Tuple(2, 2)
   - `self._array = list(flat_list)` → list(Tuple()) → []
   - `self._rank = len(shape)` → len((2, 2)) → 2
   - `self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, shape, 1)` → 1 * 2 * 2 → 4

The returned object has these attributes:
- `_array`: [] (empty list since the matrix _mat was null)
- `_rank`: 2 (length of shape tuple)
- `_loop_size`: 4 (product of shape dimensions: 2 * 2)
