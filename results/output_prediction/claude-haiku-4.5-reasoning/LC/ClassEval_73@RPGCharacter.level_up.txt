[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `level_up` method step by step.

Initial state of self:
- name: "John"
- hp: 140
- attack_power: 30
- defense: 20
- level: 3
- exp: 0

Now executing level_up():

1. Check condition: if self.level < 100
   - self.level = 3, which is < 100, so the condition is True

2. Execute the if block:
   - self.level += 1 → self.level = 3 + 1 = 4
   - self.exp = 0 → remains 0
   - self.hp += 20 → self.hp = 140 + 20 = 160
   - self.attack_power += 5 → self.attack_power = 30 + 5 = 35
   - self.defense += 5 → self.defense = 20 + 5 = 25

3. Return statement: return (self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)
   - Returns (4, 160, 35, 25)
