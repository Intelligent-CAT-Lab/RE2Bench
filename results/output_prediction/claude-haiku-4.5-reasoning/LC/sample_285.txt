[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the code step by step.

The function is:
```python
def f(text, ch):
    return text.count(ch)
```

Given inputs:
- text = "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!"
- ch = " " (a space character)

The function calls `text.count(ch)`, which counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `ch` (space) in the string `text`.

Let me count the spaces in "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!":
- "This" followed by a space (1st space)
- "be" followed by a space (2nd space)
- "Pirate's" followed by a space (3rd space)
- "Speak" followed by a space (4th space)
- "for" followed by a space (5th space)
- "'help'!" (no trailing space)

Total number of spaces: 5
