Let me trace through this code step by step.

The input is: `"\"FFEE\""` in JSON format.

In JSON, `\"` represents an escaped quote character. So `"\"FFEE\""` represents the string with literal quote characters: `"FFEE"` (6 characters total: quote, F, F, E, E, quote)

Now executing the code:

1. `s = sorted(input())` - sorts all characters in the input string
   - Input characters: `"`, `F`, `F`, `E`, `E`, `"`
   - ASCII values: `"` = 34, `E` = 69, `F` = 70
   - After sorting: `"`, `"`, `E`, `E`, `F`, `F`
   - So `s = ['"', '"', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'F']` (list of 6 characters)

2. Now checking the condition: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[2] == s[3] and (s[0] != s[2]):`
   - `s[0] == s[1]` → `'"'` == `'"'` → **True**
   - `s[2] == s[3]` → `'E'` == `'E'` → **True**
   - `s[0] != s[2]` → `'"'` != `'E'` → **True**
   - Overall: `True and True and True` = **True**

3. Since the condition is True, it executes `print('Yes')`

The output is: `Yes`
