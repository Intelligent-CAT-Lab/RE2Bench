[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of this function step by step.

The function `f` takes an array as input: `array = []`

1. First while loop: `while -1 in array:`
   - Checks if -1 is in the array. Since the array is empty `[]`, the condition is False.
   - We skip this loop entirely.

2. Second while loop: `while 0 in array:`
   - Checks if 0 is in the array. Since the array is still empty `[]`, the condition is False.
   - We skip this loop entirely.

3. Third while loop: `while 1 in array:`
   - Checks if 1 is in the array. Since the array is still empty `[]`, the condition is False.
   - We skip this loop entirely.

4. `return array`
   - The function returns the array, which remains `[]` (unchanged throughout).

The output is an empty list.
