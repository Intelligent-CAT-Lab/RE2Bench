[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `next_smallest` function with `lst = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.

Step 1: `lst = sorted(set(lst))`
- `set(lst)` creates a set from the list: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `sorted()` sorts this set into a list in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- So `lst` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Step 2: `return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]`
- The condition checks if `len(lst) < 2`
- `len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5`, which is not less than 2
- So we execute the else clause and return `lst[1]`
- `lst[1]` is the element at index 1 (the second element), which is `2`

The function returns `2`.
