1. `dup_l1_norm` is called with `f = [1, 2]` and `K = ZZ` (integers).
2. Since `f` is not empty, it proceeds to call `K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))`.
3. `dup_abs(f, K)` applies `K.abs` to each coefficient in `f`, resulting in `[1, 2]`.
4. `K.sum([1, 2])` computes the sum of the absolute coefficients, which is 3.

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output.

1. The function `assign_name` is called with `name = "foo"` and `func = <function namefoo at 0x7f8b0e1c0d30>`.
2. Inside the function, it checks if `name` is not in `self._lookup`, which is true because `self._lookup` is initially empty.
3. Since the condition is true, it assigns `func` to `self._lookup[name]`. That is, it sets `self._lookup["foo"] = <function namefoo at 0x7f8b0e1c0d30>`.
4. The function completes and returns `None` implicitly.
