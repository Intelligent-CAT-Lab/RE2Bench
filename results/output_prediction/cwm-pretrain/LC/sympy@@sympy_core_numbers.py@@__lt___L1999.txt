You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE].

2. Inside `getbasetemp`, since `_basetemp` is None, so basetemp = Path("/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0"). Therefore, getbasetemp() returns "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".
3. Inside `make_numbered_dir`:
    root = /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0
