I will carefully analyze the function and input step by step.

[PYTHON]
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n ** 2
[/PYTHON]

[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 3
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

<think>
Let's execute this code step by step:
1. The function is defined as `car_race_collision(n: int)`.
2. The input shows that we are calling this function with `n = 3`.
3. Inside the function, we have `return n ** 2`.
4. When n is 3, we calculate 3 squared (3 * 3).
5. The result of 3 squared is 9.
6. So the function returns 9.

Based on this analysis, the output should be:
{
    "output": 9
}
</think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": 9
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[OUTPUT]

[OUTPUT]
```

    "output": 9
}
```
