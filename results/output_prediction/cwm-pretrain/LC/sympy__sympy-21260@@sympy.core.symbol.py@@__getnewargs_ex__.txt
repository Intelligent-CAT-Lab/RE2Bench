1. We need to predict the output of `Dummy.__getnewargs_ex__()` with given inputs.
2. Since input doesn't provide values for `name` and `dummy_index`, we need to understand how these are determined.
3. From the code, we see:
   - `name` is used to create the symbol name.
   - `dummy_index` is randomly generated using a random number generator.
   - `_base_dummy_index` is initialized once as a class variable for consistent indexing.
4. Each `Dummy` object has a unique `dummy_index`.
5. The default name for the symbol is "x" as seen from typical usage of `Dummy()`.
6. The assumptions are taken from `self.assumptions0`.
7. Given no input for `name` or `dummy_index`, we can assume default values will be used.

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function.

1. The function `_tokenize_list` takes two arguments:
   - `s`: the string to tokenize
   - `list_delimiters`: a list of delimiter strings
2. The function first checks if the string `s` is empty or only whitespace using `if not s.strip()`.
3. In the given input, `s` is an empty string (`""`).
4. Since the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list `[]`.
5. This is done as per the first condition in the code: `if not s.strip(): return []`.

1. The function `interpret_mul_relation` takes two arguments:
   - `rhs`: the right-hand side expression of a relation (e.g., "5*x")
   - `LHS`: the left-hand side expression of a relation (e.g., "2*x")
2. First, the function converts `LHS` to a polynomial and extracts the polynomial and variable using `as_poly`.
3. It then identifies the variable part of the relation by using `a`, which is the first argument of `rhs`.
4. The function attempts to solve for the variable `x` in the polynomial equation defined by `LHS` and `rhs`.
5. In this case, `rhs = 5*x` and `LHS = 2*x`, so the equation becomes 2*x = 5*x, which simplifies to 3*x = 0, hence x = 0.
6. The solution is added to the result list `R` and the function returns this list.
