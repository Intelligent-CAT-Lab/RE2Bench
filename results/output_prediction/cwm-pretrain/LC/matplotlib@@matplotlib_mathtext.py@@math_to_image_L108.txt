1. `math_to_image` is called with `s="$x^2$"` and `filename_or_obj="/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/example.png"`. The other parameters `prop`, `dpi`, `format`, and `color` are `None` or not provided.
2. A `MathTextParser` is created to parse the input string. The `_output_type` is set to `"vector"` as the default.
3. The method `parse` of `MathTextParser` is called to parse the string. This returns a `VectorParse` object containing the parsed expression and the calculated width, height, and depth.
4. A new `Figure` is created with the calculated size based on the parsed dimensions.
5. The input string `$x^2$` is added as text to the figure.
6. The figure is saved to the specified file path `"/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/example.png"` using the `savefig` method.
7. The `depth` of the parsed text is returned as the output.

[/OUTPUT]

The `math_to_image` function processes the input text `$x^2$`, creates a figure, places the text on it, saves the figure as a PNG file, and returns the depth of the parsed text. Based on the function, the expected output is the `depth` value, which is a float number. The value 0.7 is a plausible depth for the parsed text.
