Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The input array is `[5]`. 
2. We check the length of the array. Since the length is not 0, we proceed to the `else` part.
3. The expression `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0` is evaluated. Since the array has only one element, `array[0]` and `array[-1]` are both 5. The sum is 10, and 10 modulo 2 equals 0. The condition evaluates to True.
4. The `reverse` parameter for the `sorted()` function is set to `True` because the condition is met. 
5. The `sorted()` function is called with `reverse=True`, which means the array should be sorted in descending order. However, since the array has only one element, the sorted result remains `[5]`.
6. The final output is `[5]`.
