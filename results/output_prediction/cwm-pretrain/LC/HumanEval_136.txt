Sure! I'll help you generate the appropriate output for the function `largest_smallest_integers` given the input. Let's go through it step-by-step and predict the output.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": (-1, None)        
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Now, I'll explain why I came to that conclusion.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The input list is: `[-1, -3, -5, -6, 0]`.

2. **Filtering Negative Numbers**:
   - The function filters all elements in `lst` where `x < 0` (i.e., negative numbers).
   - The `filter` returns `[-1, -3, -5, -6]` (0 is excluded as it's not negative).
   - These values are stored in the `smallest` variable.

3. **Filtering Positive Numbers**:
   - The function filters all elements in `lst` where `x > 0` (i.e., positive numbers).
   - Since there are no positive numbers in the list, `filter` returns an empty list.
   - This empty list is stored in the `largest` variable.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - `max(smallest)` finds the largest (i.e., closest to zero) negative number in the `smallest` list, which is `-1`.
   - `min(largest)` would attempt to find the smallest (i.e., closest to zero) positive number, but since `largest` is empty, it returns `None`.

5. **Result**:
   - The function returns the tuple `(-1, None)`.
