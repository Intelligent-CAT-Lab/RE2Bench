Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The input `array` is an empty list: `[]`. So `just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array))` maps the empty list to another empty list, which is `just_ns = []`.
2. `final_output = []` initializes an empty list.
3. The for loop `for wipe in just_ns:` iterates over `just_ns`, which is empty, so the loop does not run at all.
4. The return value is `final_output`, which is `[]`.
