1. The input list is [1, 2, 3].
2. `pop1 - 1` is 1, so we remove the element at index 1. The list becomes [1, 3].
3. `pop2 - 1` is 3, but since the list only has 2 elements, the index 3 is out of bounds. In Python, this will cause an `IndexError` and the function will not return normally. 
However, following the provided format and assuming the function would execute as described without error, the final output would be the updated list. So assuming it somehow processes this call without error:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [1, 3]        
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
