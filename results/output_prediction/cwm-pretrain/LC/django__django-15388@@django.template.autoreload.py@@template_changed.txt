1. `template_changed` is called with `sender` set to `None` and `file_path` pointing to an HTML template inside `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/`.
2. The function checks if the file's extension is `.py`. It is not, so the function proceeds.
3. It calls `get_template_directories()`. This function iterates over all engines in the template system (which are `DjangoTemplates` instances).
4. For each engine, it looks at the directories specified in the engine's configuration. It skips any engines that are not `DjangoTemplates` instances.
5. It also iterates through the engine's `template_loaders` to get additional directories from `get_dirs()`. If a directory is part of Django's core (determined by `is_django_path`), it is skipped.
6. All the collected paths are added to a set and returned from `get_template_directories()`.
7. Back in `template_changed`, the function checks if any of the paths in the set (returned from `get_template_directories()`) are parents of the `file_path`. If they are, `reset_loaders()` is called and `True` is returned, otherwise `None` or `False`.
8. Since `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/` is a valid template directory, `reset_loaders()` is called and the function returns `True`.
