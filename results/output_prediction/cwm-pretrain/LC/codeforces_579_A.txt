<think>
The function initializes `n` as the integer value of the input "536870912". `x` is initialized to 1. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly subtracts powers of 2 from `n` until the logarithm base 2 of `n` is an integer.

1. Initially, `n = 536870912`. `x = 1`.
2. The logarithm base 2 of `n` is 29.0, which is an integer, so the loop doesn't execute.
3. The function returns `x = 1`.

1. The function is called with `n = 2`.
2. Since `n` is not 0 or 1, the function moves to the else block and returns `2 * calculate_recursive_factorial(1)`.
3. The function is called with `n = 1`.
4. Since `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
5. The original call returns `2 * 1 = 2`.

Let's step through the code with the input "52010110201":

1. The input text is "52010110201".
2. We start with n = 2 (first iteration).
3. The first character is '5', which is not 2, so we rotate the string: "20101021025".
4. The first character is '2', which is equal to n=2, so we remove it: "20101021025" -> "0101020125".
5. We continue with the remaining characters.
6. n = 3 (second iteration).
7. The first character is '0', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "1010201250".
8. The first character is '1', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "0102012501".
9. The first character is '0', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "102012501".
10. The first character is '1', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "02012501".
11. The first character is '0', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "2012501".
12. The first character is '2', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "012501".
13. The first character is '0', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "12501".
14. The first character is '1', which is not 3, so we rotate the string: "2501".
