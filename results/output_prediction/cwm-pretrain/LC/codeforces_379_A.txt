<think>
Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, `a = 80`, and `b = 970`.
2. `x = a` sets `x = 80`.
3. `h = 0` initializes a counter `h` to 0.
4. `s = 0` initializes another counter `s` to 0.

Now we enter the first while loop:
`while x > 0:`  
    `x -= 1`  
    `h += 1`  
    `s += 1`

Since `x` starts at 80, this loop will execute 80 times:
- On each iteration, `x` decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.
- On each iteration, both `h` and `s` increase by 1.
- At the end of this loop, `x = 0`, `h = 80`, and `s = 80`.

Next, we enter the second while loop:
`while s // b != 0:`  
    `h += 1`  
    `s = s - b + 1`

We evaluate `s // b`:  
Since `b = 970` and `s = 80`, we have `80 // 970 = 0`.  
Therefore, the condition `s // b != 0` is false, and the loop does not execute.

We then print `h`:
`print(h)`  
At this point, `h = 80`.
