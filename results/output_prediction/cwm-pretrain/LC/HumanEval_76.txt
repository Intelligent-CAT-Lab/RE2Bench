The function is_simple_power is checking whether a given number x can be represented as a power of n. The function is called with x=1 and n=1. 

1. Inside the function, the first condition checks if n equals 1. Since n is indeed 1, the condition is true.
2. The code then returns whether x is equal to 1. Since x is also 1, the return value will be True.
3. The result of the function call is_simple_power(1, 1) is therefore True.
