Let's think step by step:
1. __init__ is called with self={}
2. subtract is called with c1=(-1+2j) and c2=(-3+4j)
3. Subtract the real parts: -1 - (-3) = 2
4. Subtract the imaginary parts: 2 - 4 = -2
5. Create the complex result: 2 - 2j
6. The output is 2 - 2j

The output of subtract((-1+2j), (-3+4j)) is 2 - 2j

Let's think step by step:

1. The function is called with numbers=[5, 1, 2, 3] and n=2.
2. The first check isinstance(numbers, int) is false since numbers is a list, not an integer.
3. The elif check isinstance(numbers, str) is false since numbers is a list, not a string.
4. The if check n <= 0 is false since n=2 is positive.
5. sorted_numbers = sorted(list(numbers)) sorts the list to [1, 2, 3, 5].
6. nth_smallest = sorted_numbers[n-1] accesses the 2nd element (index 1) which is 2.
7. The function returns 2.

The function correctly finds the 2nd smallest number in the list [5, 1, 2, 3] which is 2.

Let's think step by step through the function execution:

1. a is assigned the value 0.
2. b is assigned a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) - but it doesn't affect the output since it's not used.
3. c is assigned the list [1, 2, 3].
4. d is assigned the list ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
5. x is assigned c + d, which gives [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", "cherry"].
6. y is assigned list(set(x)), which creates a set from x (removing duplicates), then converts back to list. 
   The set will have the elements {1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", "cherry"} 
   (the order might vary as sets are unordered).
7. z is assigned x + y, which concatenates [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", "cherry"] with the set from y.
   Since the elements in the set were originally in x, the combined list will have duplicates.

Finally, the function returns z, which will be a list containing two copies of each element in x: 
[1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", "cherry", 1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", "cherry"].

Let's think step by step:

Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function is called with `inputs = [("F", 32), ("kilometers", 5)]`.

2. `temperature_mapping` is initialized with two key-value pairs:
   - "F": 5/9 ≈ 0.555556
   - "C": 9/5 = 1.8

3. `distance_mapping` is initialized with two key-value pairs:
   - "miles": 0.621371
   - "kilometers": 1/1.60934 ≈ 0.621371

4. `inputs[0]` is decomposed into `temperature_unit` and `temp_value`:
   - `temperature_unit` = "F"
   - `temp_value` = 32

5. `inputs[1]` is decomposed into `distance_unit` and `distance_value`:
   - `distance_unit` = "kilometers"
   - `distance_value` = 5

6. `temperature_result` is calculated as:
   - `32 * 0.555556` = 17.777778 (approximately 18.0)

7. `distance_result` is calculated as:
   - `5 / 0.621371` ≈ 8.04673 (approximately 8.1)

8. The function returns a tuple: (17.777778, 8.04673)

3. sorted_array is assigned the value sorted(array) which is [1, 2, 3] since the array is already sorted.
4. The condition sorted_array[0] > 0 and sorted_array[-1] < 100 is evaluated:
   - sorted_array[0] = 1 > 0 is True
   - sorted_array[-1] = 3 < 100 is True

1. The function is_budget is called with:
   s = "i5 256 2.0 800"
   value = 1000

2. The function splits the string 's' using space as the delimiter:
   s.split(' ') gives ['i5', '256', '2.0', '800']

3. The function takes the last element of the split result:
   s.split(' ')[-1] gives '800'

4. The function compares this string '800' with the integer value 1000 using <=:
   In Python, comparing strings and integers using <= will raise a TypeError

Therefore, the function will actually raise an error because it's trying to compare a string ('800') with an integer (1000) using the <= operator, which is not allowed in Python.
