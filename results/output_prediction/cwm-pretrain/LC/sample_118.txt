The function `f` is designed to iteratively build up a string `extra_chars` and remove all occurrences of that string from `text`, up to `num_applies` times. Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `num_applies` is set to 2.
   - `extra_chars` is initialized as an empty string.

2. **First iteration of the loop** (`i = 0`):
   - `extra_chars += chars` appends "mk" to `extra_chars`, so `extra_chars` becomes "mk".
   - `text.replace(extra_chars, '')` removes all occurrences of "mk" from the input string `text`.
   - The original string `text` is "zbzquiuqnmfkx". Removing "mk" gives "zbzquiuqnfzx" (as "mk" occurs only once in the string).

3. **Second iteration of the loop** (`i = 1`):
   - `extra_chars += chars` appends "mk" again, so `extra_chars` becomes "mkmk".
   - `text.replace(extra_chars, '')` attempts to remove all occurrences of "mkmk" from the current value of `text`, which is "zbzquiuqnfzx".
   - Since "mkmk" does not appear in "zbzquiuqnfzx", no changes are made to `text`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `text`, which is "zbzquiuqnfzx".
