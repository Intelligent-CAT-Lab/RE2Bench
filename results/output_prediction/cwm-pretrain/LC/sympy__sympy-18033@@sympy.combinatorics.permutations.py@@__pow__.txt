1. The input to `__pow__` is `n=-2`, which is an integer.
2. The method converts `n` to an integer (`n = int(n)`), so `n = -2`.
3. It then calls the function `_af_pow` with the `array_form` of the permutation and `n = -2`.
4. The result of `_af_pow` is used to create a new `Permutation` object using `_af_new`.
5. The output should be a `Permutation` object where `_size` is still 7, but `_array_form` is the result of applying `__pow__(-2)` to the original permutation.
