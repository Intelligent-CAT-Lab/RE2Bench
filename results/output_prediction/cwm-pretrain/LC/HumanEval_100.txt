To predict the output of the `make_a_pile` function, let's follow these steps:

1. The function `make_a_pile` takes a single argument `n`.
2. It returns a list comprehension `[n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]`.
3. The value of `n` is 3.
4. The `range(n)` produces the sequence of integers from 0 to 2 (inclusive): `[0, 1, 2]`.
5. For each `i` in this range, the expression `n + 2 * i` is calculated:
   - When `i = 0`, `3 + 2 * 0 = 3`.
   - When `i = 1`, `3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.
   - When `i = 2`, `3 + 2 * 2 = 7`.
6. The resulting list is `[3, 5, 7]`.

Therefore, the output of the function `make_a_pile(3)` is the list `[3, 5, 7]`.
