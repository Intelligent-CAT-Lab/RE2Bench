Let's execute the code step by step. 
1. The function f is called with num = [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
2. num.append(num[-1]) appends the last element of num (which is 1) to the end of the list. The list becomes [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1].
3. The function returns the modified list.

<|output|>
```
{
    "output": [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
<|end_output|>
