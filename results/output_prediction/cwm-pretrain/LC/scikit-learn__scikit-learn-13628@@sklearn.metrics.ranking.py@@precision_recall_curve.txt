Let's analyze the execution step-by-step and determine the output of the `precision_recall_curve` function given the inputs.

### Inputs:
- `y_true`: `null`
- `probas_pred`: `null`
- `pos_label`: `1`
- `sample_weight`: `null`

This means that both `y_true` and `probas_pred` are `null`, which in Python typically means they are not initialized or have not been assigned a value. We can infer that their actual values are not provided or are missing.

### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **Function Call:**
   - The function `precision_recall_curve` is called with the inputs:
     - `y_true = null`
     - `probas_pred = null`
     - `pos_label = 1`
     - `sample_weight = null`

2. **Call to `_binary_clf_curve`:**
   - Inside `precision_recall_curve`, the function `_binary_clf_curve` is called with the same inputs (`y_true`, `probas_pred`, `pos_label`, `sample_weight`).
   - Since both `y_true` and `probas_pred` are `null`, this likely results in an error or unexpected behavior because the function expects valid arrays or sequences for these inputs.

3. **Inside `_binary_clf_curve`:**
   - The function attempts to determine the type of `y_true` using `type_of_target(y_true)`.
   - Since `y_true` is `null`, the check for `isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix))` or whether it has an `__array__` attribute fails, resulting in a `ValueError` being raised.

4. **Error Raised:**
   - The function raises an error because `y_true` is not a valid input (it's `null`), which is required for computing precision and recall curves.

---

### Conclusion:

Given that both `y_true` and `probas_pred` are `null`, the function `precision_recall_curve` cannot compute the required values for precision and recall. The internal function `_binary_clf_curve` will fail due to invalid input types, likely raising a `ValueError`.

---

### Final Output:

Since the function fails due to invalid input, the output will not be a valid result but rather an error. However, based on the expected format and the structure requested, the output would be an error or an indication of invalid input.
