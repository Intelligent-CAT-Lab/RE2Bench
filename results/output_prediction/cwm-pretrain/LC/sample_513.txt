Sure, let's go through the execution of the given function `f(array)` step-by-step with the input `array = []`, following the same format as in the example.

### 🧠 Analysis of the function `f(array)`

The function `f(array)` contains three nested `while` loops:
- **First loop:** `while -1 in array:`
  - If `-1` is found in `array`, it removes the element at index `-3` (third from the end).
- **Second loop:** `while 0 in array:`
  - If `0` is found in `array`, it removes the last element.
- **Third loop:** `while 1 in array:`
  - If `1` is found in `array`, it removes the first element.

The function then returns the modified array.

### 🔍 Execution with Input: `array = []`

Let's simulate step-by-step:

```python
array = []

while -1 in array:   # -1 is not in array → loop doesn't execute
    array.pop(-3)    # This line never runs
while 0 in array:    # 0 is not in array → loop doesn't execute
    array.pop()      # This line never runs
while 1 in array:    # 1 is not in array → loop doesn't execute
    array.pop(0)     # This line never runs

return array         # Returns empty list []
```

Since `array` is empty from the start, none of the loops execute because their conditions are not met.
