Let's analyze the code and input step by step:
1. We have the BookManagement class that manages an inventory dictionary
2. The add_book method checks if a title exists in inventory:
   - If it does, it increments the quantity by the given amount (default 1)
   - If it doesn't, it adds the title with the given quantity
3. The input shows:
   - Initial inventory: {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}
   - Calling add_book with title="book2" and default quantity=1
4. Since "book2" already exists in inventory (with quantity 1), we add 1 to it
5. Resulting inventory should be: {"book1": 2, "book2": 2}
6. The output format requested is a JSON object with the updated output value

The code first initializes self.inventory as an empty dictionary in the constructor.
Then add_book("book2", 1) is called:
1. "book2" is already in inventory with value 1
2. We add 1 to this value
3. The new value of self.inventory["book2"] is 2
The output should be this updated value, which is 2

Based on the code and input:
1. We're working with the BookManagement class that has an inventory dictionary
2. The initial inventory has {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}
3. The add_book method is called with title="book2" and default quantity=1
4. Since "book2" already exists in inventory, we add 1 to its current value of 1
5. The result is a new inventory state of {"book1": 2, "book2": 2}
6. The output should reflect the updated inventory value for "book2"
