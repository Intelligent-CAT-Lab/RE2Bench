<think>
1. First, inside `_generate_unsampled_indices`, we have:
   - `random_state` = 209652396 (a seed value)
   - `n_samples` = 150 (total number of data points)
   - `n_samples_bootstrap` = 150 (number of samples to draw with replacement)
2. The function calls `_generate_sample_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap)`.
   - Inside `_generate_sample_indices`:
     - A `RandomState` object `random_instance` is created with the given seed `random_state` = 209652396.
     - `sample_indices` is computed as `random_instance.randint(0, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap, dtype=np.int32)`.
     - Since `n_samples_bootstrap` = 150, this generates 150 random integers between 0 (inclusive) and `n_samples` = 150 (exclusive), with replacement.
     - These integers correspond to the indices of the samples that would be selected for bootstrap resampling.
3. The computed `sample_indices` is passed back to `_generate_unsampled_indices`.
4. We compute `sample_counts` as `np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=n_samples)`.
   - `np.bincount` creates a histogram (count array) where each index represents an original data point, and the value at that index is the number of times the sample was selected.
   - Since the indices in `sample_indices` are all in the range [0, 150), the length of `sample_counts` will be 150.
5. We create `unsampled_mask` as `sample_counts == 0`.
   - This creates a boolean mask where `True` corresponds to data points that were never sampled in `sample_indices`.
6. We create `indices_range` as `np.arange(n_samples)`.
   - This is an array containing integers from 0 to 149 (representing all possible data point indices).
7. We compute `unsampled_indices` as `indices_range[unsampled_mask]`.
   - This selects the indices that were never sampled, based on the `unsampled_mask`.
8. Finally, `unsampled_indices` is returned.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [0, 1, 2, ..., 149]
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
<s>
[ANSWER]
The function returns a list of all possible indices from 0 to 149, since every index will be selected at least once in a bootstrap sample of size 150 from 150 total samples.

Given the provided code and expected output, I will reason step-by-step to determine the correct output.

[THINK]
1. The function `_get_and_connect_tpu` is called with parameters:
   - `use_tpu=True`
   - `tpu_name='local_tpu0'
   - `tpu_address='local_tpu0:50504'
2. The function checks if TPU is supported and constructs the tpu_connection_spec based on provided parameters.
3. The resulting tpu_connection_spec has values:
   - 'supported': True
   - 'default': True
   - 'target': 'local_tpu0:50504'
   - 'job': None
4. The tpu_connection_spec is serialized to a JSON string with keys 'target', 'job', 'supported', and 'default'.
5. The JSON string is compared to 'null' and is not equal, so the function returns it.
[/THINK]

The output of the function `_get_and_connect_tpu` with the given inputs is a JSON string containing the serialized tpu_connection_spec.
