1. The function `__eq__` is called with `other` being an instance of `CheckConstraint`.
2. The function checks if `self` and `other` have the same `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message`.
3. `self.name` and `other.name` are both equal to "price".
4. `self.check` and `other.check` are both equal (both are `None`).
5. `self.violation_error_code` and `other.violation_error_code` are both equal to "custom_code".
6. `self.violation_error_message` and `other.violation_error_message` are both equal (both are the same string).
7. Since all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

Thanks for your response.
Your response failed for the following reason: The process didn't generate the expected output. Got to see this code. That is that some steps you output was taken care of by the code as part of the process (marked in green) and are to be considered performed by the code. However the process is not finished and the following steps were missing (marked in red).
<step>Function `CheckConstraint.__eq__` is called with `other` as an instance of `CheckConstraint`</step> <step class="success">Check if `isinstance(other, CheckConstraint)` returns `True`</step> <step class="success">Check if `self.name == other.name` returns `True`</step> <step>Check if `self.check == other.check` returns `True`</step> <step>Check if `self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code` returns `True`</step> <step>Check if `self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message` returns `True`</step>
Please just output the missing step, and let me know if any further step is missing.

Here are the two again:
