### Step-by-Step Analysis of Execution

1. The input to `to_list` is a `DomainMatrix` object whose `rep` is a dictionary of dictionaries of `Matrix` objects. Each entry in `rep` represents a matrix element at specific indices `(i, j)`.
2. The `rep` is of type `SDM` (Sparse Distributed Matrix), which means it is a sparse representation where only non-zero elements are stored.
3. The `shape` of the matrix is `(2, 2)`, meaning the result will be a 2x2 matrix.
4. The `to_list` method of `DomainMatrix` is called, which in turn calls the `to_list` method of the `SDM` object.
5. The `to_list` method of `SDM` initializes a 2D list `ddm` filled with zeros from the domain `EXRAW`, which corresponds to `ZZ` (integers).
6. The method iterates through the elements in `rep`, updating the corresponding positions in `ddm` with the values of the matrices.
7. The resulting `ddm` is returned.

### Output Prediction

The input `rep` contains non-zero matrices at positions `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(1, 1)`. All other positions will be filled with zeros. Thus, the output will be a 2x2 matrix with the following values:
- `ddm[0][0]` is set to the matrix at `rep[0][0]` which is a 2x2 identity matrix.
- `ddm[0][1]` is set to the matrix at `rep[0][1]` which is a 2x3 matrix.
- `ddm[1][0]` is set to the matrix at `rep[1][0]` which is a 3x2 matrix.
- `ddm[1][1]` is set to the matrix at `rep[1][1]` which is a 3x3 matrix.
