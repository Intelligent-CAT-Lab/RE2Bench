There are two properties of the given function, labeled as Property 1 and Property 2. Which of the following assertions is true?

1. Property 1 is correct and Property 2 is incorrect.
2. Property 2 is correct and Property 1 is incorrect.
3. Property 1 and Property 2 are both correct.
4. Property 1 and Property 2 are both incorrect.

1. Evaluate property 1:
We first compute the sum of the heights of the two columns for both the left table and the right table.

- For the left table, the total height is 65 + 39 = 104 inches.
- For the right table, the total height is 88 + 45 = 133 inches.

Since the sum of the heights of the left table (104 inches) is less than the sum of the heights of the right table (133 inches), this property is **correct**.

2. Evaluate property 2:
We compute the height of the rightmost object for both the left table and the right table. 

- For the left table, the rightmost object is the statue with a height of 65 inches.
- For the right table, the rightmost object is the height difference between the statue and the table, which is 88 inches.

Since 65 inches is less than 88 inches, this property is **incorrect**.

Therefore, only **Property 1 is correct**, and **Property 2 is incorrect**.
