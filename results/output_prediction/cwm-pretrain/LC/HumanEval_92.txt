1. Let's check if x, y, and z are all integers:
   - x = 2 (int)
   - y = 1 (int)
   - z = 1 (int)
   
   Since all three are integers, we enter the if block.
2. Now we check if any two numbers add up to the third:
   - x + y = 3 (which is not equal to z = 1)
   - x + z = 3 (which is not equal to y = 1)
   - y + z = 2 (which is equal to x = 2)
   
   We found that y + z == x, so we return True.

1. First, we need to understand what the function does. It calculates the number of possible non-negative solutions to an integer equation in n variables with sum k.
2. Looking at the input, we have n = 3 and k = 2.
3. To solve this, we can think of this as distributing 2 indistinguishable items into 3 distinct boxes.
4. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using the "stars and bars" method.
5. The formula is (k + n - 1) choose (n - 1).
6. Applying the formula with k = 2 and n = 3, we get (2 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) = 4 choose 2 = 6.

3. We can simulate the function's behavior step by step.

1. The function `is_power_of_two` checks if a number is a power of two.
2. It does this by using the bitwise AND operation to see if there's only one 1 in the binary representation.
3. Let's apply this to the input 8.
4. First, we calculate 8 - 1 = 7. In binary, 8 is 1000 and 7 is 0111.
5. Then we do 8 & 7. Since the only 1 bit is not set in both numbers, the result is 0.

1. The function `solve_2nd_degree` solves the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

3. The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is 9 - 8 = 1, which is greater than 0.
4. This means we'll get two distinct real roots.
5. We calculate the roots using the quadratic formula: (-b ± sqrt(D)) / (2a)
6. The roots are (-(-3) ± sqrt(1)) / (2*1) = (3 ± 1) / 2
7. This gives us two roots: (3 + 1)/2 = 2 and (3 - 1)/2 = 1

   - fibonacci(0) = 0
   - fibonacci(1) = 1
   - fibonacci(2) = 1
   - fibonacci(3) = 2
   - fibonacci(4) = 3
