To determine the output of the function `_is_standard_calendar` with the given input, we first need to understand what the function does and then apply it to the provided arguments.

### Understanding the Function
The function `_is_standard_calendar(calendar)` is designed to check if a given calendar is considered "standard." It does this by converting the `calendar` input to lowercase and checking if it matches any of the items in the `_STANDARD_CALENDARS` set, which contains the strings `'standard'`, `'gregorian'`, and `'proleptic_gregorian'`.

### Applying the Function to the Input
Given the input `"GREGORIAN"`:

1. The function will convert `"GREGORIAN"` to lowercase, resulting in `"gregorian"`.
2. It then checks if `"gregorian"` is in the `_STANDARD_CALENDARS` set.
3. Since `"gregorian"` is indeed in the set, the function will return `True`.

### Generating the Output
According to the provided format, the output should be enclosed within `[OUTPUT]` and `[/OUTPUT]` tags. The output structure is defined with a placeholder `XXX` for the actual output value.

Given this, the output of the function `_is_standard_calendar("GREGORIAN")` is `True`, as `"gregorian"` is recognized as a standard calendar.
