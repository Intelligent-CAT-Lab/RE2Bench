The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input and performs the following operations:

1. `set(l)` removes duplicate elements from the list `l`.
2. `list(set(l))` converts the set back into a list.
3. `sorted(list(set(l)))` sorts the list in ascending order.

Applying this logic to the input list `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the unique elements are `[5, 3, 2, 9, 0, 123]`. Sorting this list gives `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.

Therefore, the output of the function is `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
}
```
