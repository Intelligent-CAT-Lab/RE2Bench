The object is an empty matrix of size 4x4, and thus all values are zero. The matrix has an all-zero upper triangular form by default. The function is_upper checks this by using ranges i and j. For i from 1 to rows and j from 0 to min(i, cols), since the matrix has no data, this evaluates to True for all combinations.

You have a function `is_upper` that will be called with the following input:

{
    "self": {
        "rows": 4,
        "cols": 4,
        "_mat": null
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}

Given this input, what would be the result of the function call?
