<think>
1. The split function uses re.split to split the text based on the regex pattern.
2. The pattern is "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b" which matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.
3. The text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"
4. re.split will find all phone numbers and split the text at those points.
5. The phone numbers are "123-456-7890", "876-286-9876", and "987-762-9767".
6. The split text will have the phone numbers removed and return the remaining parts.
7. So, re.split will return an array with the parts of the text that don't match the phone number pattern.

class PyClass:

        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        
    def a_method(self):
        return self.param1 + self.param2
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `a_method`, given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "param1": 1,
        "param2": 2

    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{ 
    "output": XXX 
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>
1. The object is initialized with param1=1 and param2=2.
2. The a_method returns the sum of self.param1 and self.param2.
3. So, the output will be 1 + 2 = 3.
</think>

[OUTPUT]

class Tag(Immutable[str]):
    pass
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `__repr__`, given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "__value": "hello"
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{ 
    "output": XXX 
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>
1. The Tag class inherits from Immutable[str], which initializes the __value attribute to "hello".
2. The __repr__ method returns a string representation of the object in the format "Immutable({self.__value!r})".
3. Since self.__value is "hello", the output will be "Immutable('hello')".
</think>
[OUTPUT]

    "output": "Immutable('hello')"

class MathUtils:

    def closest_square(self, n: int) -> int:
        return round(n ** 0.5) ** 2
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `closest_square`, given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 18
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX 
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. round(18 ** 0.5) is round(sqrt(18)) which is round(4.24264...) which is 4.
2. 4 ** 2 = 16.
Therefore, the closest square to 18 is 16.
</think>
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": 16

[PYTHON]
import math

class MathUtils:

    def is_even(self, num: int) -> bool:
        return num % 2 == 0
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `is_even`, given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "num": 9
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "output": XXX 
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

<think>
Let's evaluate the is_even function step by step:
1. The function takes an input number: num = 9
2. It checks if num is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator (%)
3. Since 9 % 2 = 1 (there is a remainder), the condition num % 2 == 0 is False
4. Therefore, the function returns False
</think>

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": false

This prompt is used to complete the missing statements or fields of a Python class based on the given code and a prompt that provides guidance on how to do so. The missing parts of the class and its fields or methods are marked with XXX as placeholders. The challenge requires the model to reason and decide how to implement the missing functionality to complete the class definition.

<b>Internal monologue:</b>
 I will need to use the given code and prompt to fill in the missing fields or methods of the XXX class. I will use my knowledge of Python to decide how to implement the missing functionality. I will need to reason and think about how to complete the XXX class based on the prompt and the given code. I will need to determine if I need to add fields or methods to the XXX class, and if so, what those fields or methods should be and how they should be implemented. I will use the given code and prompt to guide my decision-making process. Once I have decided how to implement the missing functionality, I will fill in the XXX placeholders with the appropriate code.
