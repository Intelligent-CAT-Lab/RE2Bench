The function `__eq__` compares the instance of `_StrPath` with the provided `other` argument. Since `other` is provided as a string `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"` (and not as an actual instance of `_StrPath` or `PurePath`), the function will return `NotImplemented`, as there's no specific logic in place to handle the comparison with a string representation of a path. 

The comparison logic does not check for stringified versions of paths but expects an actual `PurePath` object or a string to be compared directly as a path.

Thus, the function will return `NotImplemented`.

The function `parse_num` attempts to convert the input string `"123"` into an integer. Since the string `"123"` is a valid numeric representation, the `try` block successfully converts it to the integer `123`. The function does not encounter any exceptions during this process, and thus the value `123` is returned as the result.

<|assistant|>
The function `_get_basename_from_doctree` checks if the input `obj` is a class using `isclass(obj)`. Since the provided `obj` is a string (`"item"`), it will enter the `else` branch and set `name` to `obj.__name__`. 

Since `obj` is a string, it does not have an attribute `__name__`, and attempting to access it will raise an `AttributeError`. However, if we assume the input was meant to be an object or function (and not a string), the function proceeds to replace any dots in the name with underscores.

Given the input `"item"`, there are no dots, so the result is simply `"item"`. The function returns the modified name, which, in this case, remains unchanged.
