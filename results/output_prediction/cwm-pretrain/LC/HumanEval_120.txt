Let's go through the function step by step:
1. The input is `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.
2. The if condition `if k == 0` is false, so we skip it.
3. `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order. After this, `arr = [-4, 4]` remains the same.
4. `arr[-k:]` selects the last `k` elements. Here, `k = 2`, so `arr[-2:]` returns the entire array `[-4, 4]`.
5. The function returns `ans = [-4, 4]`.

Therefore, the output of the function is `[-4, 4]`.

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
def maximum(arr, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    arr.sort()
    ans = arr[-k:]
    return ans
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `maximum` given the following input:

```

    "self": {},

        "arr": [

            1
        ],
        "k": 2
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
