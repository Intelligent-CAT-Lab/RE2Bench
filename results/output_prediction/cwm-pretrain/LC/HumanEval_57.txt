To execute the function `monotonic` with the given input, let's break down the steps:

1. The input is a list `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`.
2. The function `monotonic` checks if the list is either sorted in ascending or descending order.
   - `sorted(l)` would return `[9, 9, 9, 9]`, which is the same as the original list.
   - Therefore, the condition `l == sorted(l)` is True.
3. Since the condition is met, the function returns `True`.
