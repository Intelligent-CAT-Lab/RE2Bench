Let's execute the code step by step.
1. Initialize `squared = 0`.
2. First element in `lst` is `-1.4`. `math.ceil(-1.4)` becomes `-1`. Then `-1 ** 2 = 1`. Add this to `squared` which becomes `1`.
3. Second element is `17.9`. `math.ceil(17.9)` becomes `18`. `18 ** 2 = 324`. Add to `squared`: `1 + 324 = 325`.
4. Third element is `18.9`. `math.ceil(18.9)` becomes `19`. `19 ** 2 = 361`. Add to `squared`: `325 + 361 = 686`.
5. Fourth element is `19.9`. `math.ceil(19.9)` becomes `20`. `20 ** 2 = 400`. Add to `squared`: `686 + 400 = 1086`.
6. The final value of `squared` is `1086`.
7. The function will return `1086`.
