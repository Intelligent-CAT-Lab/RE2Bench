1. The function `collect` is called with the following arguments:
   - `expr` is "_Dummy_373" (a symbolic expression)
   - `syms` is None
   - `func` is None
   - `evaluate` is True
   - `exact` is False
   - `distribute_order_term` is True

2. The function `collect` is designed to collect terms in an expression with respect to the provided symbols. If `syms` is None, it should handle the default behavior.

3. Since `syms` is None, the function will process the expression "_Dummy_373" without any specific symbols for collection.

4. The function processes the input expression and, since no specific collection or transformation is needed for "_Dummy_373", it returns the expression unchanged.

5. Since `evaluate` is True, the function will return the processed expression directly.

Remember that I'm using the [OUTPUT] tag to clearly enclose the predicted output in my response. The output is just the unchanged input expression "_Dummy_373" since no collection or transformation is needed. </s>

I don't think the observed output `{"output": "_Dummy_373"}` is consistent with the predicted output. Please try to use your Python environment to extract from the provided source code the functions required to complete the following steps, then implement these steps using Jupyter Notebook to obtain the correct output. This output should be enclosed within [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT] tags. You should use the `print()` function to produce the output. Here are the functions and steps you will need to execute:
