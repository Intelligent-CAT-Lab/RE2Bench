Let's analyze the execution of the `classification_report` function step by step based on the inputs and the internal logic of the function.

### Step-by-Step Execution Analysis

1. **Initialization and Type Checking:**
   - The function starts by calling `_check_targets` on `y_true` and `y_pred`. This function checks the type of the input labels (multiclass, binary, etc.) and ensures they are consistent.

2. **Label Processing:**
   - Since `labels` is not provided, the function uses `unique_labels(y_true, y_pred)` to find all unique labels in both `y_true` and `y_pred`. This creates a set of labels: `['blue', 'green', 'red']`.

3. **Classification Type Check:**
   - It determines if the classification is a binary or multiclass problem. In this case, since there are more than two unique labels, the classification is multiclass.

4. **Precision-Recall-F1-Support Calculation:**
   - The function `precision_recall_fscore_support` is called to compute the precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. This is done by:
     - Creating a multilabel confusion matrix that counts true positives, false positives, and false negatives.
     - Calculating precision, recall, and F1-score based on the confusion matrix.
     - Averaging these metrics over all classes using the `macro` method, which gives equal weight to all classes.

5. **Confusion Matrix and Counting Logic:**
   - Internally, `multilabel_confusion_matrix` is used. Since `y_true` and `y_pred` are not sparse matrices or indicator arrays, the function labels them using a `LabelEncoder`. This assigns unique integer labels to each class (e.g., `['blue', 'green', 'red']` might be encoded as `0, 1, 2`).
   - The function then uses `np.bincount` to count occurrences of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 

6. **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Calculation:**
   - Using the counts from the confusion matrix, the function computes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class:
     - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
     - Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
     - F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   - These values are averaged across all classes using the `macro` average method.

7. **Reporting:**
   - Since `output_dict` is `False` (default), the function returns a formatted string with the classification report, including per-class metrics and macro-averaged metrics.

### Final Output

Given the inputs, the expected output will be a formatted classification report string. Here is the correct prediction:

[OUTPUT]
```python
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support

             blue       0.15      0.25      0.19        10
            green       0.16      0.27      0.21        31
             red       0.39      0.09      0.15        19

        macro avg       0.23      0.20      0.18        60
```
[/OUTPUT]

### Note
- The `output` field in the structure should contain this exact string. This report indicates that the precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each class (blue, green, red) and averaged across all classes using the `macro` averaging method.
- The `support` column indicates the number of instances of each class in the input data.
