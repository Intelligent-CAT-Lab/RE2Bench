1. The function _mask_nc is called with the argument eq set to a symbolic expression involving sin and a Sum object. This equation does not involve any non-commutative expressions or symbols, so the masking process is not needed.
2. Since the equation is commutative, the function directly returns (eq, {}, []), where the second element is an empty dictionary (indicating no substitutions were made), and the third element is an empty list (indicating no non-commutative symbols were identified).

    If `moddict` is empty or None, a ``globals()`` will be used to determine
    the meaning of the predicate function. Otherwise, the given dictionary
    must be the globals in which the function was defined.

    of (a, b) tuples will be returned, where the first element is the
    match and the second element is the matched expression of the second

    only those expressions that match will be returned.

    If the optional ``walk`` keyword argument is True, then a tree
    generator of (a, b, c) tuples will be returned, where ``a`` is the
    match, ``b`` is the matched expression of the second type, and ``c``
    is the matched expression's parent.  This keyword has no effect if
    the ``map`` keyword is not also True.

    is False (the default), then search for expressions that are
    components of the given expression.

1. The _search function is called with expr=1, predicate=is_Mul, fgen={"0": {"value": "1"}}, and the following kwargs: map=True, walk=True, and tree=None.
2. The predicate is checked, and since it is "is_Mul" (which should be a function in the context, though not explicitly defined here), it is assigned to _search_match as is_Mul.
3. The function attempts to iterate over the items in fgen, but since the value "1" does not match is_Mul, it proceeds to recursively search within the components of the expression.
4. However, given the structure of the input and the predicate not being satisfied, there are no valid matches found.
