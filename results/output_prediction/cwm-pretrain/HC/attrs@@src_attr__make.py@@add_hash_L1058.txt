Let's go through the execution step by step and analyze the values of the variables at each step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `_ClassBuilder` is called with parameters `auto_attribs=false`, `these=null`, and `has_custom_setattr=false`.
   - This creates an instance of the `_ClassBuilder` class.

2. **Configuration of the Class**:
   - Inside `_ClassBuilder.__init__`, the attributes `self._cls`, `self._attrs`, `self._cache_hash`, and others are initialized based on the parameters and the properties of the class (`props`).
   - Since `auto_attribs=false`, no attributes are automatically extracted from the class.
   - `_cache_hash` is determined by `props.hashability is ClassProps.Hashability.HASHABLE_CACHED`. Since this is not explicitly set, it defaults to a certain value based on the properties.

3. **Hash Script Generation**:
   - The `add_hash` method calls `_make_hash_script`, which generates the script and glob variables needed to implement the `__hash__` method.
   - The `attrs` parameter in `_make_hash_script` is a list of `Attribute` objects. Only attributes with `hash=True` (or default) are considered.
   - If `cache_hash=True`, `_make_hash_script` adds logic to cache the hash value.
   - The generated script (`script`) and glob variables (`globs`) are stored in the `_script_snippets` list.
   - The function returns `self`, which means the `_ClassBuilder` instance.

4. **Variable Values**:
   - `self._cache_hash`: This variable determines whether the hash is cached. Based on the input, it is not explicitly set, so its value depends on the properties of the class.
   - `attrs`: The list of `Attribute` objects that will be used to compute the hash. It includes attributes that are hashable.
   - `script`: The Python script generated for the `__hash__` method, which includes logic for computing the hash and caching it if enabled.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The `add_hash` method returns the modified `_ClassBuilder` instance (`self`).
   - The only relevant variable to capture in the output is `self`, which is an object of type `_ClassBuilder` that has been modified to include the hash functionality.

Based on this analysis, the output structure should capture the return value of `add_hash`, which is the `_ClassBuilder` instance after the hash script has been added.



[ANSWER]
assert add_hash() == None
