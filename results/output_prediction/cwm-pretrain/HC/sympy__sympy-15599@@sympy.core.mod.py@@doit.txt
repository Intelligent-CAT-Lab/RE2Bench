1. The function `doit(p, q)` is being called with `p = 2*t` and `q = t`.
2. Since `q = t` is not equal to 0, we skip the check for division by zero.
3. Both `p` and `q` are not infinite, so we skip the infinite or nan checks.
4. `p` is not zero, `p` is not equal to `q`, and `p` is not the negative of `q`, so we skip these checks.
5. `q` is not a Number, so we skip the number-related checks.
6. We attempt to call `_eval_Mod` on `p`, but since `p` does not have this method, we skip this.
7. We calculate `r = p / q`, which is `2*t / t = 2`.
8. Since `d = int(r) = 2` is an integer, we calculate `rv = p - d * q = 2*t - 2*t = 0`.
9. Since `rv * q = 0 * t = 0`, we return `rv = 0`.
