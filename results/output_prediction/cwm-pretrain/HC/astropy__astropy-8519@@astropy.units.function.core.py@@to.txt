1. Inside `to`, `self._physical_unit` is of type `UnitBase` (meter), and `self._function_unit` is of type `FunctionUnitBase` (with scale -2.0, meaning it scales its input by 1/100). 
2. `other` is also a `UnitBase` (meter), so `other_function_unit = other`, and no functional unit is applied.
3. Since `self.function_unit` (FunctionUnitBase with scale -2.0) is not equivalent to `other_function_unit` (UnitBase: meter), the function attempts to convert using the physical units only. Since the units are equivalent, the conversion should proceed.
4. The `value` provided is "2.5", a string, so it will be parsed as a float inside the method. The method will return 2.5 (as both units are the same).

You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between <think> and </think>.

1. Inside `mktemp`, since `numbered`=True (default), it calls: p = make_numbered_dir(root=self.getbasetemp(), prefix="world")
2. Inside `getbasetemp`, since `_basetemp` is None, so basetemp = Path("/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0"). Therefore, getbasetemp() returns "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".
3. Inside `make_numbered_dir`:
    root = /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0
    prefix = "world"
    Since max_existing = -1, new_number = 0, so `new_path` = "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0"

1. Inside `mktemp`, `numbered` is "false" (a string, not a boolean), so the condition `if not numbered:` is true because the string is non-empty.
2. `self.getbasetemp()` is called, and since `self._basetemp` is None, and `self._given_basetemp` is not None, it returns `self._given_basetemp` = "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0"
3. `p` is assigned the value `/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world`
4. `p.mkdir()` is called to create the directory.
