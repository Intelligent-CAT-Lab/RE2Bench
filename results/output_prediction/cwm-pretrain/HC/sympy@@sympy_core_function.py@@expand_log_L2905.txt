<think>
1. Inside `expand_log`, `factor` is False, so it enters the first `if` block.
2. `_handleMul` is defined, but since the input expression is just "log(2)", there are no multiplications to handle, so it doesn't get called.
3. `expr = expr.replace(...)` is executed, but since there are no multiplications to replace, the expression remains unchanged.
4. Finally, `sympify(expr).expand(...)` is called, which simply returns the original expression since there is nothing to expand.
