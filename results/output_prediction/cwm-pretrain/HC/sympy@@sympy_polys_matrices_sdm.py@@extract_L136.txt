Let's simulate the `extract` function step by step with the provided input:
```
{
    "self": {
        "shape": [
            3,
            3
        ],
        "rows": 3,
        "cols": 3,
        "domain": "ZZ"
    },
    "args": {
        "rows": [
            0,
            1,
            2
        ],
        "cols": [
            0
        ]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
Step 1: `rows` = [0, 1, 2], `cols` = [0]

Step 2: Since `self` is not empty and both `rows` and `cols` are non-empty, the function skips returning zeros.

Step 3: Validate rows and columns. The minimum of `rows` is 0 and the maximum is 2, which is within the range of `self.shape` rows (0 to 2). The minimum of `cols` is 0, which is within the range of `self.shape` columns (0 to 2).

Step 4: Build `rowmap` and `colmap`:
- `rowmap` maps each original row index to a list of its corresponding indices in the new matrix. Since each index in `rows` is the same as its index in the original matrix, the mapping will be direct:
  - rowmap[0] = [0]
  - rowmap[1] = [1]
  - rowmap[2] = [2]
- `colmap` maps each original column index to a list of its corresponding indices in the new matrix. Since `cols` has only one index (0), the mapping is:
  - colmap[0] = [0]

Step 5: Extract the relevant rows and columns from `self` and create the new sparse matrix:
- The loop `for i1 in rowset & sdm1.keys()` iterates over rows that exist in both the original matrix and the requested `rows`.
- For each such `i1`, a new `row2` is created with only the columns in `colset & row1.keys()`, where `row1` is the row from the original matrix.
- The new matrix `sdm2` is populated with these rows, mapped to their corresponding indices in the new matrix.

Step 6: Return the new matrix.

The resulting sparse matrix `sdm2` will have the same rows and columns as requested, each filled with the corresponding values from the original matrix.
