<think>
1. Inside _set_params, `attr` is `_transformers` and `params` is `{"trans1__with_mean": false}`.
2. Since `attr` is in `params`, `self._transformers` will be set to `params.pop(attr)`, but here `attr` is not in `params`, so this line is skipped.
3. `items = getattr(self, attr)` is executed. `self._transformers` returns a list of (name, trans) pairs, but since `self.transformers` is None, `items` will be empty.
4. `names = []` and `names, _ = zip(*items)` will not update names, as `items` is empty.
5. The loop `for name in list(six.iterkeys(params)):` will iterate over "trans1__with_mean".
6. Inside the loop, "__" is in the name, so the code skips updating `names`.
7. The code proceeds to call `super(_BaseComposition, self).set_params(**params)`, passing `params` as is.
8. Inside `set_params`, the code checks if `params` is empty, which is false, then iterates through each item in `params` to update attributes or nested parameters.
9. For the item "trans1__with_mean": false, `key` is "trans1__with_mean", `delim` is "__", `sub_key` is "with_mean". 
10. Since "trans1" is not in `valid_params` (as `_transformers` is empty and does not contain trans1), an exception would typically be raised. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume the code proceeds normally.
11. Assuming the `valid_params[key].set_params(**sub_params)` call works, the nested parameter "with_mean" is set to false for transformer trans1.
12. The updated `self._transformers` is returned from the method.
