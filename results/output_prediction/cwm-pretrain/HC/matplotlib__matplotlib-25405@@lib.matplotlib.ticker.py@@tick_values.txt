Given the input to the `tick_values` function, let's walk through its execution step by step.

1. **Initial Setup**: The method is called with `vmin = 0.5` and `vmax = 50`. The `numticks` is set to 9, meaning the desired number of tick locations is 9.

2. **Adjust `vmin` if it's not positive**: Since `vmin = 0.5` is positive, there's no need to adjust it.

3. **Logging**: The method logs the initial values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

4. **Ensuring `vmax` is not less than `vmin`**: Here, `vmax` (50) is greater than `vmin` (0.5), so no swap is necessary.

5. **Computing Logarithms**: The method calculates `log_vmin` and `log_vmax` using the logarithm base 10:
   - `log_vmin = math.log(0.5) / math.log(10) ≈ -0.3010`
   - `log_vmax = math.log(50) / math.log(10) ≈ 1.69897`

6. **Calculating Number of Decades**: The number of decades (`numdec`) is the difference between the floored value of `log_vmax` and the ceilinged value of `log_vmin`. This results in:
   - `numdec = math.floor(1.69897) - math.ceil(-0.3010) = 1 - (-0) = 1`

7. **Handling Subs and Stride**: 
   - The `_subs` attribute is a string "auto", but its value is overridden to an array [1.], so `subs = [1.0]`.
   - The stride calculation is: `stride = max(math.ceil(1 / 8), 1) = max(1, 1) = 1`. This stride determines how many decades to skip between tick locations.

8. **Generating Tick Locations**: 
   - The decades array is generated starting from `math.floor(log_vmin) - stride` (which is `math.floor(-0.3010) - 1 = -1`) to `math.ceil(log_vmax) + 2 * stride` (which is `math.ceil(1.69897) + 2 = 3`), with step `stride` (1). This yields the array `[-1, 0, 1, 2]`.
   - Since `stride == 1` and `have_subs` is True, the tick locations are generated using: `np.concatenate([subs * decade_start for decade_start in b ** decades])`. This results in the array `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`.

9. **Filtering Tick Locations**: The method filters out any tick locations that are not within the `vmin` and `vmax` range. All generated tick locations (0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0) are within the specified range.

10. **Final Output**: The final tick locations are `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`.

Since the input you provided is for the `tick_values` method of the `LogLocator` class in Matplotlib, I will walk through the method's execution with the given parameters and compute the output.

1. **Initial Setup**: The method is called with `vmin = 0.5` and `vmax = 50`. The `_base` attribute is set to 10.0, `_subs` is "[1.]", `numdecs` is 4, and `numticks` is 9.

2. **Computing Logarithms**: The method calculates the log values of `vmin` and `vmax` with respect to the base 10:
   - `log_vmin = log10(0.5) ≈ -0.3010`
   - `log_vmax = log10(50) ≈ 1.69897`

3. **Calculating Number of Decades**: The number of decades (`numdec`) is the difference between the ceiling of `log_vmin` and the floor of `log_vmax`. This results in:
   - `numdec = math.floor(1.69897) - math.ceil(-0.3010) = 1 - (-0) = 1`

4. **Stride Calculation**: The stride determines how many decades to skip between tick locations. The stride calculation is:
   - `stride = max(math.ceil(1 / 8), 1) = max(1, 1) = 1`

5. **Generating Decades**: The method generates an array of decades, starting from `math.floor(log_vmin) - stride` to `math.ceil(log_vmax) + 2 * stride`, with step `stride`. This results in:
   - `decades = [-1, 0, 1, 2]`

6. **Generating Tick Locations**: Since `subs` is [1.0] and `stride` is 1, the method calculates tick locations by multiplying each decade value by each subs value. This results in the array `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`.

7. **Final Output**: The output of the `tick_values` method is the array `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`.

    "output": [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]

That's correct! The detailed execution of the `tick_values` method, step-by-step, leads to the array `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`. This is because the method calculates the tick locations in a logarithmic scale using the base 10, starting from `vmin` and ending at `vmax`.
