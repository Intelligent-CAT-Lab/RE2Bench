Here is the step-by-step reasoning to predict the output:

1. The `_mapping_repr` function is called with the arguments `mapping={"foo": "bar"}`, `title="Attributes"`, `summarizer={}`, and `expand_option_name="display_expand_attrs"`.

2. The function initializes `col_width` by calling `_calculate_col_width(mapping)`. This calculates the width needed to display the keys in the mapping. Since the only key in the mapping is "foo" which is 3 characters long, `col_width` becomes 3 + 6 = 9 (as per the function definition).

3. The function initializes `max_rows` to 10 (default value of `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`).

4. It initializes the `summary` variable with the title `"Attributes:"`.

5. Since the mapping is not empty (`len(mapping) = 1`), it checks if the option `display_expand_attrs` is set to `True` (which it is by default).

6. Since `len(mapping) = 1` which is less than `max_rows = 10`, it adds the summarizer result for the key "foo" using `summarize_datavar("foo", var, col_width)` to the `summary` list. `var` would be the value corresponding to the key "foo" in the mapping.

7. Finally, it joins the summary list with newlines to form the output string and returns it.

8. The summarizer function used here is `summarize_datavar`, which in turn calls `summarize_variable` with the name "foo" and the value "bar" (assuming the value of the key "foo" in the mapping).

9. The `summarize_variable` function formats the variable according to the given `col_width` and returns a string representing the variable.

10. Since `col_width` is 9, and the variable is a simple string, the output will be a string that includes the name "foo" padded to 9 characters width and the value "bar".
