1. `sympify` is called on the input string to convert it into a sympy expression. The string "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2" is converted to a symbolic expression.
2. The expression is then processed in the `do` function, which recursively applies various sympy methods to simplify the expression.
3. The expression `sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2` is evaluated to the numerical approximation using sympy's numerical capabilities.

The expression `sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2` simplifies to `sin((1/156*pi))**2`, which is approximately `1/6**2`.

Therefore, the final output should be 1/36 or approximately 0.0277777777777778, but since we are dealing with sympy, it is better to represent the output as a fraction.
