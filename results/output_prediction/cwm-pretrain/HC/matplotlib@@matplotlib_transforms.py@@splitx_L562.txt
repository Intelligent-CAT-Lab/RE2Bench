Let's trace through the execution step-by-step, focusing on the values of the variables at each step.

1. The function call to `splitx` is initiated with the given input. The `self` parameter is a Bbox object with extents [0.125, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]. The first argument of `args` is 0.85, and the second argument of `args` is 0.85.
2. Inside the function, `xf` is initialized as [0, 0.85, 0.85, 1] by combining 0 with the args and 1.
3. The variables `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, and `y1` are extracted from `self.extents`. The values are:
   - x0 = 0.125
   - y0 = 0.1
   - x1 = 0.9
   - y1 = 0.9
4. The variable `w` is calculated as `x1 - x0`, resulting in `w = 0.775`.
5. The `itertools.pairwise(xf)` function is called, which generates pairs of consecutive elements from `xf`. The pairs are (0, 0.85) and (0.85, 1).
6. For each pair (xf0, xf1), a new `Bbox` object is created. The x-coordinates for the new Bbox are calculated as `x0 + xf0 * w` and `x0 + xf1 * w`. The y-coordinates remain the same as `y0` and `y1`.
   - For the first pair (0, 0.85):
     - x0 + xf0 * w = 0.125 + 0 * 0.775 = 0.125
     - x0 + xf1 * w = 0.125 + 0.85 * 0.775 = 0.776875
     - New Bbox: [[0.125, 0.1], [0.776875, 0.9]]
   - For the second pair (0.85, 1):
     - x0 + xf0 * w = 0.125 + 0.85 * 0.775 = 0.776875
     - x0 + xf1 * w = 0.125 + 1 * 0.775 = 0.9
     - New Bbox: [[0.776875, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]
7. The resulting list of `Bbox` objects is returned.

The final result is a list of two `Bbox` objects as described above.
