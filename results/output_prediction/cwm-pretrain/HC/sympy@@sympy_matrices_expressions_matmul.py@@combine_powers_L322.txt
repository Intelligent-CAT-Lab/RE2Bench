Step 1: Understand the structure of the input and output.
- Input: The `mul` argument represents a multiplication operation of two matrices, "X" and "Z".
- Output: The function should return a structured JSON object with the simplified form of the multiplication, possibly combining powers if applicable.

Step 2: Analyze the execution of `combine_powers`.
1. `factor, args = mul.as_coeff_matrices()` 
   - Extracts scalar and matrix components from the multiplication.
   - Since "X" and "Z" are matrices, `factor` will be 1, and `args` will be ["X", "Z"].

2. Iterates through `args` to simplify the multiplication.
   - For each matrix in `args`, check if it is a power of another matrix and simplify accordingly.
   - If "X" and "Z" are distinct and not powers of each other, they will remain as separate terms.

Step 3: Construct the final output.
- The simplified form will be "X*Z", as there are no powers or inverse relations to simplify.
- Return the structured output with the simplified expression.
