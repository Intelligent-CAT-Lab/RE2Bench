You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output.

<think>
1. Inside `mktemp`, since `numbered`=True (default), it calls: p = make_numbered_dir(root=self.getbasetemp(), prefix="world")
2. Inside `getbasetemp`, since `_basetemp` is None, so basetemp = Path("/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0"). Therefore, getbasetemp() returns "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".
3. Inside `make_numbered_dir`:
    root = /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0
    prefix = "world"
    Since max_existing = -1, new_number = 0, so `new_path` = "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0"
