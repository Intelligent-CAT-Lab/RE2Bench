1. `factor_terms` is called with the expression "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)". 
2. The `do` function will be called on this expression.
3. Since the expression is a string, it will be parsed by `parse_expr` into a sympy expression.
4. `parse_expr` returns `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)` as a sympy expression.
5. The denominator `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2` is a difference of squares, which factors to `a**2*(x - y)*(x + y)`.
6. The expression becomes `2*x / (a**2 * (x - y) * (x + y))`.
7. This is the final factored form, and will be returned as the result.
