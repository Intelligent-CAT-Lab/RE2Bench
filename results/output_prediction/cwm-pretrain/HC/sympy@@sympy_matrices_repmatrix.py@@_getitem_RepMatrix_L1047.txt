**Plan:**
1. Analyze the structure of the provided Python code and identify the function that needs to be executed.
2. Identify the arguments and inputs provided for the function.
3. Step through the function's execution step-by-step, simulating the code's behavior.
4. Use the available helper functions and logic to determine the result of the function.
5. Predict the output of the function based on the simulated execution.
6. Format the output using the specified structure, replacing XXX placeholders with predicted values.

**Execution:**
1. The provided function is `_getitem_RepMatrix`, which takes `self` and `key` as arguments.
2. `self` is a `RepMatrix` object with rows=3, cols=3, and a `_rep` object that seems to be a domain matrix representation of a rotation matrix.
3. `key` is a tuple (0, 0), which represents the indices to access in the matrix.
4. The function first checks if `key` is a tuple. If not, it handles different cases for indexing.
5. Since `key` is a tuple, it unpacks `i` and `j` as 0 and 0.
6. It attempts to call `self._rep.getitem_sympy(index_(i), index_(j))`.
   - `index_` is an alias for `operator.index`.
   - `operator.index` returns the integer value of its argument. For 0, it's just 0.
   - `self._rep.getitem_sympy(0, 0)` returns the value at position (0, 0) in the matrix.
7. Based on the `_rep` object provided, the value at position (0, 0) is `cos(phi)`.

**Conclusion:**
The function `_getitem_RepMatrix` should return the value at position (0, 0) of the matrix, which is `cos(phi)`.

**Result:**
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "cos(phi)"
}
```
