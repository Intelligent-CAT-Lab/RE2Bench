Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. We have an input array of size 10
2. The function checks if the first argument is a sequence - it is
3. Then it converts the input to a numpy array
4. It creates a mask of finite values - all are finite
5. Since all values are finite, the final mask contains all points
6. As no points are filtered out, the original array is returned

The function will return the original input array unchanged since none of the points are masked or non-finite.



[ANSWER]
assert delete_masked_points(input_array) == ['0.  ', '0.05', '0.1 ', '0.15', '0.2 ', '0.25', '0.3 ', '0.35', '0.4 ', '0.45']
