The function `_matrix_derivative` begins by importing `ArrayDerivative` from `sympy.tensor.array.array_derivatives` and setting up the lines of the derivative result using the `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method of the `expr` object. This method likely returns a list of expressions representing the derivative lines. The next step involves iterating over these lines to create a parts list, where each element is constructed using the `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method.

The function `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` from `sympy.core.expr.Expr` returns a list of `_LeftRightArgs` objects. Each `_LeftRightArgs` object contains lines for the derivative result. The `_LeftRightArgs` constructor is called with the lines and the `higher` parameter set to `S.One`. The `_build` method of `_LeftRightArgs` is then called to construct the parts of the derivative result.

The `get_rank` function is defined to calculate the rank of the parts. The rank is the sum of dimensions (excluding `None`) for each part. This rank is calculated for each part in the `parts` list. The `contract_one_dims` function is defined to contract one-dimensional parts, but since the rank is 2 or less, this function is not called in this particular case.

Finally, the `ArrayDerivative` is returned with the `expr` and `x` as arguments.
