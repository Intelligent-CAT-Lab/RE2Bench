<think>
1. `__contains__` calls `contains` method with item="<Version('1.0a1')>"
2. Inside `contains` method, `version = _coerce_version("<Version('1.0a1')>")`
   Since _coerce_version returns the parsed Version object, version = Version("1.0a1")
3. Check if `version is None` (it is not)
4. Check if `installed and version.is_prerelease`:
   - `installed` is None (default), so this condition is not met
5. Call `list(self.filter([version], prereleases=prereleases))` with version=[Version("1.0a1")]
6. Inside `filter` method:
   - Since `self._specs` is an empty frozenset, the `else` clause is executed
   - If `prereleases is None and self.prereleases is not None`, then use `self.prereleases`
     Here, `prereleases` is None, and `self._prereleases` is True (passed in)
   - `prereleases = True` (set from self.prereleases)
   - Since `prereleases is True`, return `iter(iterable)` which is `iter([Version("1.0a1")])`
   - Convert the iterator to a list, so we get [Version("1.0a1")]
7. Convert the list to a boolean, which returns True because the list is not empty
