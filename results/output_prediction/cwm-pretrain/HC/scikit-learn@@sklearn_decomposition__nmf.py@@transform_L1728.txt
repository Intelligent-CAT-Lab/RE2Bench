1. `check_is_fitted` is called to ensure that the estimator has been fitted. Since the estimator has attributes such as `_n_components`, `_beta_loss`, `reconstruction_err_`, `n_components_`, `components_`, and `n_iter_`, the check passes.
2. `X` is validated using `validate_data`. The input `X` is converted into a NumPy array of shape (6, 5) with 64-bit floating-point numbers.
3. Since the solver is set to `'cd'` (coordinate descent), `_fit_coordinate_descent` is called with the given input `X` and the current components.
4. The coordinate descent algorithm iteratively updates the components to minimize the loss function while ensuring non-negativity. Given the inputs, the components are updated, and the final `W` matrix is returned after convergence or reaching the maximum number of iterations.
5. The transformed data `W` is returned as the output.
