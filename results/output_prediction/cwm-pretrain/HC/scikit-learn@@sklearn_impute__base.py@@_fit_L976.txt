1. Inside `_fit`, since `precomputed` is True, it checks if X has dtype 'b' (boolean), which it does. So it sets `self._precomputed` to True.
2. Since `_precomputed` is True, it calls `_check_n_features` to set the number of features in the input.
3. It then calls `self._get_missing_features_info(X)`, which returns the imputer mask and the indices of the features containing missing values.
4. Since `features` is "missing-only", it computes the number of missing values in each feature and returns the indices of features with missing values.
5. The final step is to return the imputer mask.
