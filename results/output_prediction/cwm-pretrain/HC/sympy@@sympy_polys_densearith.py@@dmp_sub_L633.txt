<think>
1. Inside `dmp_sub`, since `u`=0, it calls: return _dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K))
2. _dup(f) returns `[]` and _dup(g) returns `[]`
3. Inside `dup_sub`, since `f` and `g` are both empty, it returns `dup_neg(g, K)`. Since `g` is `[]`, it returns `dup_neg([], K)`, which is `[]` since negation of an empty list remains empty.
