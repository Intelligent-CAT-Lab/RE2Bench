1. _eval_snippets is called:
    - Since _script_snippets is empty, it does nothing.
2. _patch_original_class is called:
    - _delete_attribs is True (since these is null)
    - For each name in _attr_names, it tries to delete attributes in _cls
    - It sets all items in _cls_dict to _cls
    - It updates __attrs_own_setattr__ to False and sets __setattr__ to _OBJ_SETATTR since _has_custom_setattr is False
3. _create_slots_class is called since _slots is True:
    - Creates cd with items from _cls_dict excluding __dict__ and __weakref__
    - Sets __attrs_own_setattr__ to False and __setattr__ to _OBJ_SETATTR
    - Creates a new class with __slots__ containing all attributes
    - Returns the new class with updated slots and attributes
4. Returns the built class with updated slots and attributes
