1. The `prepare_url` function is being called with the following parameters:
   - `url`: "http://localhost:49515/"
   - `params`: {}

2. The first step is to check if `url` is an instance of bytes. In this case, it is not, so we proceed to step 3.

3. The `url` is converted to a string and stripped of leading whitespace. In this case, the `url` remains "http://localhost:49515/".

4. We check if the `url` contains a colon (:) and does not start with 'http' in lowercase. Since the `url` starts with 'http', this condition is not met, so we proceed to step 5.

5. We parse the `url` using the `parse_url` function. This function returns a tuple containing the scheme, authentication information, host, port, path, query, and fragment of the `url`. In this case, the tuple contains the following values:
   - `scheme`: 'http'
   - `auth`: None
   - `host`: 'localhost'
   - `port`: 49515
   - `path`: ''
   - `query`: ''
   - `fragment`: ''

6. We check if the `scheme` is empty. In this case, it is not, so we proceed to step 7.

7. We check if the `host` is empty. In this case, it is not, so we proceed to step 8.

8. We check if the `host` contains non-ASCII characters. In this case, it does not, so we proceed to step 9.

9. We check if the `host` starts with a wildcard character (*) or a dot (.). In this case, it does not, so we proceed to step 10.

10. We construct the `netloc` part of the URL. Since there is no authentication information, the `netloc` is simply the `host` followed by a colon and the `port`. In this case, the `netloc` is 'localhost:49515'.

11. We check if the `path` is empty. In this case, it is, so we set the `path` to '/'.

12. We check if the `params` is an instance of str or bytes. In this case, it is not, so we proceed to step 13.

13. We encode the `params` using the `_encode_params` function. Since the `params` is an empty dictionary, the encoded `params` is an empty string.

14. We construct the final URL by combining the `scheme`, `netloc`, `path`, query, and fragment. In this case, the final URL is 'http://localhost:49515/'.

15. We assign the final URL to the `self.url` attribute.
