1. `_get_missing_features_info` method starts by checking if `self._precomputed` is False, which it isn't. So it proceeds by using the input `X` as the `imputer_mask`.
2. The input `X` is a dense array (list of lists), so it checks if `self.features` is 'missing-only', which it is.
3. It computes `n_missing` by summing the rows of `imputer_mask` along axis 0, which results in [4, 4].
4. Since `self.sparse` is 'auto', it does not convert `imputer_mask` to a sparse format.
5. The method determines `features_indices` as the indices of columns where `n_missing` is not zero, resulting in [0, 1].
6. The function returns a tuple `(imputer_mask, features_indices)`.
