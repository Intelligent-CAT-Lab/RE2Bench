 The `__getitem__` method in the `GridSpecBase` class is being called with a tuple key `(0, 0)`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the execution:

 1. The `get_geometry` method is called, which returns the number of rows and columns in the grid. In this case, it returns `(1, 1)`.
 2. The `_normalize` function is called with the key, size, and axis as arguments. The key is `0`, the size is `1`, and the axis is `1`. The function returns `(0, 0)`.
 3. The `_normalize` function is called again with the key, size, and axis as arguments. The key is `0`, the size is `1`, and the axis is `0`. The function returns `(0, 0)`.
 4. The `np.ravel_multi_index` function is called with the normalized indices and the grid size as arguments. The function returns `(0, 0)`.
 5. A new `SubplotSpec` object is created with the grid spec, num1, and num2 as arguments.

 The predicted output is the `SubplotSpec` object that is created.

**Next action after getting the output:**

1. **Verify the output with the expected output (if provided).** If the output is correct, proceed to the next step.
2. **If the output is incorrect, review the reasoning and code execution and update the prompt or code as necessary.**
3. **If the output is correct, proceed to the next step.**
4. **Repeat the process with the next input or function call.**

By following these steps, the predicted output can be verified and the reasoning can be improved.
