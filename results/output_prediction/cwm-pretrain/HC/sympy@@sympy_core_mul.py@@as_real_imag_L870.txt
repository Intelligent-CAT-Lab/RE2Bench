1. The function `as_real_imag` is called with `self = 2*pi` and `deep=True`.
2. Since `2*pi` is a complex number (due to the presence of `pi` which is symbolic and can be real or imaginary), the code enters the following logic:
   - `other` remains empty because there are no non-commutative terms.
   - `coeffr` accumulates the real parts, and `coeffi` accumulates the imaginary parts of the terms.
   - Since `2*pi` is purely real, `r = 2*pi` and `i = 0`.
   - The final result is `(reco, 0)`, where `reco = 2*pi`.
