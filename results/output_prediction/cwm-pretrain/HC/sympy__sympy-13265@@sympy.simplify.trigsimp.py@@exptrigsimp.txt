<think> 1. `exptrigsimp` is called with `expr="sinh(x) + cosh(x)"` where sinh(x) is `exp(x)-exp(-x)/2` and cosh(x) is `exp(x)+exp(-x)/2`. 2. `exptrigsimp` calls `exp_trig` on the expression `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`. 3. In `exp_trig`, `rewrite` is called on `sinh(x)` and `cosh(x)` with `exp` as the argument, which rewrites them in terms of `exp`. 4. After rewriting, the expression becomes `exp(x)/2 - exp(-x)/2 + exp(x)/2 + exp(-x)/2` which simplifies to `exp(x)`. 5. Since the expression does not contain any trigonometric or hyperbolic functions after simplification, the final output is `exp(x)`. </think>
