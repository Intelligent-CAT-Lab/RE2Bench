Let's analyze the given input and functions to determine the output of `orthogonal_mp_gram`.

1. **Inputs:**
   - `Gram`: A symmetric matrix (not shown in full, but we have its structure and some values).
   - `Xy`: A column vector of size 12x1.
   - `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1 (we want to find the largest coefficient).
   - `norms_squared`: A list with one value `[5.44055527]`.
   - `copy_Xy`: False.

2. **Function behavior:**
   - The `orthogonal_mp_gram` function performs Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) on a Gram matrix and a target vector `Xy`.
   - With `n_nonzero_coefs=1`, the function will identify the index of the single most relevant atom (row of `Gram`) by selecting the largest absolute value in `alpha = Xy - Gram * gamma` during the OMP iteration.
   - The value of `tol` is None, so the function will stop after selecting the first atom.

3. **Step-by-step reasoning:**
   - **Initial setup:**
     - `copy_Gram=False`: We don't copy the `Gram` matrix; it's already provided as a NumPy array.
     - `copy_Xy=False`: We don't copy the `Xy` vector; it's already provided as a NumPy array.
     - The function proceeds to call `_gram_omp(Gram, Xy[:, 0], 1, [5.44055527])` (since `n_nonzero_coefs=1` and `Xy.shape=(12, 1)`).

4. **Inside `_gram_omp`:**
   - `n_nonzero_coefs=1`: The function will perform one iteration of OMP.
   - The first step is to select the index `lam` where `alpha[lam]` is the largest in absolute value, as per OMP's greedy strategy.

5. **Selecting the index:**
   - The absolute values of `alpha` (initially `Xy`) are as follows:
     ```
     abs([ 0.88986487,
           2.33249979,
           0.13957277,
           0.21592705,
           0.48258954,
           0.207901,
           0.74100454,
           0.06184457,
           0.82782566,
           1.68362053,
           0.0210131,
           1.53638069 ]) = [0.88986487, 2.33249979, 0.13957277, 0.21592705, 0.48258954, 0.207901, 0.74100454, 0.06184457, 0.82782566, 1.68362053, 0.0210131, 1.53638069]
     ```
   - The largest value is `2.33249979` at index `1`. Therefore, the selected index is `1`.

6. **Coefficient assignment:**
   - The function will return `coef[idx] = Xy[idx]`, where `idx=1` and `Xy[1] = 2.33249979`.
   - The output will be a 12x1 vector (same as `Gram.shape`) where only the element at index `1` is non-zero, with the value `2.33249979`.
