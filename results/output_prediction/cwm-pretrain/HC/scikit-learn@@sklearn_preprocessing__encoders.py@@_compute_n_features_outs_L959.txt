I need to predict the output of the `_compute_n_features_outs` function. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The function initializes an empty list called `output`.
2. It then calculates the length of each element in the `self.categories_` list, which contains the unique categories for each feature.
3. Since `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is None, it skips the part where it would drop categories.
4. Since `self._infrequent_enabled` is False, it skips the part where it would handle infrequent categories.
5. The function returns the `output` list.

Given the input, `self.categories_` is `["['a', 'b']"]`, so the length of this string is 9 characters.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": [
        9
    ]
}
