1. The function `radsimp` is designed to simplify radical expressions.
2. The input expression `1/(a - b)` is passed to the function with `symbolic` set to `False`, which means no symbolic manipulation will be performed if the denominator has free symbols.
3. Since the denominator `(a - b)` has free symbols (`a` and `b`), the `symbolic` flag will prevent any simplification or manipulation involving radicals.
4. Therefore, the expression `1/(a - b)` will not undergo any change or simplification.
