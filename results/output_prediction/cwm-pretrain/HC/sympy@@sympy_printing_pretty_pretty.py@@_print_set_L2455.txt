I'll help you predict the output of the _print_set function based on the given input and code structure. Here's my reasoning and prediction:

<think>
1. The function _print_set is defined to handle the pretty-printing of sets.
2. The input provides a set `s` with two elements: "Q.integer" and "Q.positive".
3. Since the set is not empty, the function will call sorted() on the set using default_sort_key for ordering.
4. The sorted items will then be passed to _print_seq to create the pretty-formatted string.
5. Looking at the definitions, _print_seq creates a comma-separated list and wraps it in curly braces.

The expected output will be a pretty-formatted string showing the sorted set contents.
</think>

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "{'Q.integer', 'Q.positive'}"
}
[/OUTPUT]

This output assumes that the items are already in their final pretty-printed form, as the _print function for each item is not explicitly shown in the code snippet. The prettyForm class handles the formatting, but the specific format for individual set elements isn't visible in the code provided.
