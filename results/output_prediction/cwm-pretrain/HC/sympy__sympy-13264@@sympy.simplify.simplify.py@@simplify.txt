1. `simplify` is called with the expression "n + n**(-n)".
2. The expression is parsed into a sympy expression: `n + n**(-n)`.
3. Since the expression contains a Power (n**(-n)), and the coefficient of n is 1 (the default), `powsimp` is used to simplify the power.
4. `powsimp(n + n**(-n))` simplifies the expression to `n + 1/n`.
5. The expression is then returned as the simplified form.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "n + 1/n"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Note that in this case, the expression is simplified to its canonical form "n + 1/n", which is returned as the output. The simplify function in sympy does not perform more complex simplifications like combining fractions in this case.
