<think> Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the output of the `split_super_sub` function with the input `"Fvec"`:
1. The function starts by initializing variables: `pos = 0`, `name = None`, `supers = []`, and `subs = []`.
2. Since `pos` is less than the length of the input string `"Fvec"`, the loop begins.
3. The loop checks for potential positions of special characters ('^' and '_') in the string. However, there are no such characters in `"Fvec"`.
4. The entire string `"Fvec"` is identified as `name`.
5. After the loop, the function checks if `name` matches a pattern with digits (`^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`). It does not match since there are no digits.
6. The function returns a tuple containing `name`, `supers`, and `subs`.
Based on this reasoning process, the expected output of the function is:
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": ("Fvec", [], [])
}
[/OUTPUT]
