1. `type_of_target` is called with `y="[0, 0, 1, 1]"`, `input_name=""`, and `raise_unknown=False`. The input `y` is a string, so it is not a valid array-like type.
2. The first step is to validate that `y` is an array-like (array or non-string sequence). Since `y` is a string, the check `valid = ... or is_array_api_compliant` fails, and a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got '[0, 0, 1, 1]'".
3. This exception will be raised immediately, halting further processing.
