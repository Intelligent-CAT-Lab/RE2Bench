1. The `transform` method of `OneHotEncoder` calls `_transform_selected` with arguments X, _transform, dtype, categorical_features, and copy=True. 
2. `_transform_selected` is not shown in the code, so we assume it operates on X based on the `categorical_features` argument.
3. Since `categorical_features` is null, _transform_selected might apply the `_transform` method to all features.
4. The `_transform` method checks if any elements in X are negative, but X contains only non-negative integers (1, 1, 1), so it proceeds.
5. It compares the shape of X with the expected shape from `feature_indices_`. Since X is 1 row by 3 columns, and `feature_indices_` has shape 4, the shapes match.
6. It creates a mask based on whether each element in X is less than `n_values_`, which is [4, 3, 2]. For X = [[1, 1, 1]], all values satisfy this condition.
7. It computes `column_indices` and `row_indices` for the sparse matrix.
8. The sparse matrix is created with shape (n_samples, indices[-1]) = (1, 9). The indices[-1] is 9 because `feature_indices_` is [0, 4, 7, 9].
9. The resulting sparse matrix will have a data array of size `np.sum(mask)` = 3, with ones in positions corresponding to the indices.
10. The output of `_transform` will be a sparse matrix.
11. The output is returned by `_transform_selected` as a sparse matrix because `sparse=True`.
12. Therefore, the final output of `transform` will be a sparse matrix representing the one-hot encoded version of the input.
