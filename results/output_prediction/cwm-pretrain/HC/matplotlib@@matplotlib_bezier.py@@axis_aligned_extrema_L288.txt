    Let me analyze the execution step by step to understand what the `axis_aligned_extrema` method does with the given input.

    1. The input has:
       - _cpoints: [[0.0, -2.48451997]]
       - _N: 1
       - _d: 2
       - _px: [[0.0, -2.48451997]]

    2. In `axis_aligned_extrema`:
       - `n = self.degree` sets n to 0 (since _N = 1)
       - The first condition `if n <= 1:` is true since n = 0

    3. Since the condition is true, the method returns:
       - np.array([]) for both dimensions and roots

    Therefore, the function returns a tuple of two empty arrays, as expected when the curve is of degree 0 (a single point).

Let's analyze the execution step by step:

1. The function `create_output` is called with two arguments: "arg1" and "arg2"

2. Inside the function, it defines a nested function `md(x)` that:
   - Takes an input `x`
   - Returns a string with `<div>` tags around `x`

3. The function `create_output` returns the `md` function itself

4. The code defines a function `md(x)` that takes an input `x` and returns `<div>x</div>`

The function doesn't actually execute `md()` with any arguments, it just returns the function object. So the output will be the function object itself, not the result of calling it with any arguments.

Let me analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `create_output` is called with two string arguments: "arg1" and "arg2"
2. Inside `create_output`, a nested function `md` is defined
3. The function `md` takes one parameter `x` and returns a string wrapped in <div> tags
4. The function `md` is returned as the result of `create_output`

The important point is that `create_output` returns the function object itself, not the result of calling it with any arguments. This is similar to returning a function from another function.

So, the correct output should be the function object `md` itself, not the result of executing it with any arguments.

Let me break down the execution:

1. The `create_output` function is called with arguments "arg1" and "arg2"
2. Inside the function, it defines a nested function `md(x)`
3. The `md` function simply returns a string with `<div>` tags around its input
4. The `create_output` function returns the `md` function itself as its result

The key point is that `create_output` returns the function object, not the result of calling it. This is a common pattern in Python where a function is defined inside another function and returned.

Let me carefully analyze this code:

3. The `md` function simply returns a string with `<div>` tags around its input
4. The `create_output` function returns the `md` function object itself

Since we're just asking for the output of `create_output`, and that function returns the `md` function, the output should be that function object.
