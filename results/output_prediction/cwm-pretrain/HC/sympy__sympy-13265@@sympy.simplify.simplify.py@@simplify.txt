The given expression is (exp(x) + exp(-x))/(y*(exp(x) - exp(-x))), and we are asked to simplify it.

The `simplify` function in sympy is used to simplify the expression. 

The expression can be simplified by combining the numerator and denominator using common factors.

The numerator is exp(x) + exp(-x), and the denominator is y*(exp(x) - exp(-x)).

The common factor in the numerator and denominator is exp(x) + exp(-x).

The simplified expression will be 1/y.
