<think>
1. The deprecated function is called with `since="0.0.0"` and all other arguments set to their default values (empty strings, False, None).
2. The `deprecate` function is defined inside `deprecated`, and it is returned immediately, so it is called with the default parameters.
3. Since the `obj` parameter is not provided, the `deprecate` function only performs basic setup for a deprecated item without any specific target (class, property, or function).
4. The `finalize` function is not executed with any `new_doc` or `wrapper`, so no warning is emitted and the wrapper function is not applied.
5. As no object is being wrapped and no warning is being issued, the output is an empty dictionary since nothing is returned explicitly.
