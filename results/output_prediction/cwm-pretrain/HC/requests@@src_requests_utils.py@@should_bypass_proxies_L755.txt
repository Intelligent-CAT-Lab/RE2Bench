<think>
1. `get_proxy('no_proxy')` is called which returns None, because `no_proxy` is None and `no_proxy_arg` is also None.
2. `parsed = urlparse(url)` is called and returns `parsed.hostname` as "localhost".
3. `is_ipv4_address(parsed.hostname)` is called which returns False, because "localhost" is not a valid IPv4 address.
4. `proxy_bypass(parsed.hostname)` is called which returns False, because "localhost" is not in the no_proxy list.
