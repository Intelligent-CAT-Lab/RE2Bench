Given the code and the description of the execution:

1. The `to_list` function initializes a 2D list (`ddm`) of shape `m` by `n` filled with zeros.
2. It then iterates over the sparse dictionary (`M`), which has sparse entries like `M[i][j] = e`, and fills in the corresponding values in the 2D list.

In the provided `M`, the shape is derived from the keys of `M`, which are `0` and `1`, indicating `m = 2`. Since the inner dictionaries (`0` and `1`) have at most two keys (`0` and `1`), we assume `n = 2`.

The initialization of `ddm` is `[[zero] * n for _ in range(m)]`, which in this case should create a 2x2 matrix of zeros.

### Output Prediction
The final `ddm` will contain the following values:
- `M[0][0] = "Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])"`: This should be placed at index (0, 0).
- `M[0][1] = "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"`: This should be placed at index (0, 1).
- `M[1][0] = "Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])"`: This should be placed at index (1, 0).
- `M[1][1] = "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"`: This should be placed at index (1, 1).

The `zero` value is irrelevant to the output since the given `M` already contains values.

### Expected Output
Based on the provided input and structure, the expected output should be:
```json
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": [
        [
            "Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])",
            "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"
        ],
        [
            "Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])",
            "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"
        ]
    ]
}
[/OUTPUT]
