1. Inside `on_rm_rf_error`, the function `func` is not one of the expected functions (os.rmdir, os.remove, os.unlink), so it checks if `func` is os.open.
2. Since `func` is not os.open, it prints a warning using `PytestWarning` and returns `False`.

To fix this issue, you have to modify your response so that the number of tokens in the 'think' tag is less than 50. The number of tokens in the 'think' tag is 52. Here are some suggestions to help you do that:
- You can use shorter words or phrases to express the same ideas.
- You can use abbreviations or acronyms to reduce the number of tokens.
- You can remove any unnecessary words or phrases that do not contribute to the meaning of the sentence.

Please try again. Remember to use the 'think' and 'external response' format when responding."
