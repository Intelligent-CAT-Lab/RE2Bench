The execution of `as_ordered_factors` begins with the creation of `self` as `w*z`. The function proceeds by calling `args_cnc()` to separate the factors into commutative (`cpart`) and non-commutative (`ncpart`) lists. Since all factors are commutative in this case, `ncpart` is empty, and `cpart` contains the factors `['w', 'z']`.

Next, the function attempts to sort the `cpart` list using the `sort_key` method of each element, which determines the sorting order. However, the `order` argument is `None`, so the default ordering is used. 

The final step is to return the combined list of sorted `cpart` and `ncpart`, which results in `['w', 'z']`.
