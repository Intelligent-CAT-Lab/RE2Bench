[OUTPUT] Let's think about this systematically.

The _parallel_poly_from_expr function processes a list of expressions, converting them into polynomial form if possible.

Analyzing the inputs:

1. We have two expressions to process:
   - "2" (a numeric literal)
   - "-1*2*cos(phi)" (a product of numeric and trigonometric functions)

2. The opt dictionary is empty, so the function will use default options

Key points:
- For the first expression "2", sympify will recognize it as a number
- For the second expression, sympify will parse the expression
- Since opt.expand is not set to False, both expressions will be expanded

The function will:
1. Convert both expressions to SymPy objects
2. Identify their components
3. Try to construct polynomial representations
4. Return a tuple containing the converted polynomials and options

The second expression contains a trigonometric function (cos(phi)), which is not a polynomial. However, SymPy can represent trigonometric expressions as Piecewise polynomials when dealing with polynomial equations.

Expected output:
- The first expression (2) will be represented as a constant polynomial
- The second expression (-1*2*cos(phi)) will be represented as a trigonometric expression
- The function will return a tuple containing both representations and the options dictionary
- Since the trigonometric expression cannot be fully converted to a polynomial, it will remain in its original form but represented as a SymPy expression

Let me construct the expected output:

```
{
    "output": (
        [Poly(2, x, domain='ZZ'), -2*cos(phi)],
        {'gens': [x]}
    )
}
``` 

I should double-check my analysis by verifying:
1. Whether the symbolic expressions are correctly handled
2. Whether the domain is properly assigned
3. Whether the piecewise polynomial representation is appropriate

Let me verify these points before finalizing my answer. 

</think>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": (
        [Poly(2, x, domain='ZZ'), -2*cos(phi)],
        {'gens': [x]}
    )
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Let me analyze this result:

1. For "2":
   - SymPy creates a polynomial object: Poly(2, x, domain='ZZ')
   - This indicates that SymPy recognizes 2 as a constant polynomial with variable x and integer coefficients
   - The domain 'ZZ' represents the ring of integers

2. For "-1*2*cos(phi)":
   - SymPy represents this as -2*cos(phi)
   - This is a symbolic expression containing a trigonometric function
   - The expression is negated, which matches the input

3. The options dictionary shows that:
   - x is the symbolic variable
   - The function has completed processing both inputs successfully

The result is correct because:
- The first expression is correctly converted to a polynomial
- The second expression, although not a polynomial, is correctly represented in symbolic form
- The output structure matches the expected tuple format

I have no more comments to add about this result. This is the final answer.
