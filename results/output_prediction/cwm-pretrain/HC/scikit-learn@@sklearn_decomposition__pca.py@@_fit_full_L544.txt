1. The input matrix X has 6 rows and 2 columns. 
2. Since n_components=2 and min(n_samples, n_features)=2, no exception is raised. 
3. The mean of X along axis 0 (column-wise mean) is computed. 
4. Since self._fit_svd_solver='covariance_eigh', the covariance matrix C is calculated using the formula:
   C = X^T @ X - n_samples * mean^T * mean
   The eigendecomposition of C is performed to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
5. The eigenvalues are flipped to be in descending order. Any negative eigenvalues are set to 0. 
6. The eigenvalues are used to compute the explained variance. 
7. The singular values are obtained from the square root of the eigenvalues.
8. Since n_components=2, the top 2 components, explained variance, and singular values are kept. 
9. The output consists of U, S, Vt, X, x_is_centered, xp which are all parameters returned.
10. All these parameters are defined during the execution process.
