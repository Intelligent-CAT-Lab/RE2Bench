The `__hash__` method of the `FontProperties` class constructs a tuple from several font properties and returns its hash value. The relevant properties for this function include: `_family`, `_slant`, `_variant`, `_weight`, `_stretch`, `_size`, `_file`, and `_math_fontfamily`. These properties are already available in the given input and will be used directly.

1. `_family`: Already provided as `["sans-serif"]`.
2. `_slant`: Provided as `"normal"`.
3. `_variant`: Provided as `"normal"`.
4. `_weight`: Provided as `"normal"`.
5. `_stretch`: Provided as `"normal"`.
6. `_size`: Provided as `12.0`.
7. `_file`: Provided as `null` (treated as `None`).
8. `_math_fontfamily`: Provided as `"cm"`.

Therefore, the tuple to be hashed is:
```python
(["sans-serif"], "normal", "normal", "normal", "normal", 12.0, None, "cm")
```

Hashing this tuple will yield a unique integer value, which we cannot predict deterministically without executing the actual Python runtime environment. However, since the goal is to return a JSON structure, the output will encapsulate this hash value under the key `"output"`.

The output will be:
```json
{
    "output": XXX
}
```

Where `XXX` represents the computed hash integer for the given tuple.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": XXX
}
```
