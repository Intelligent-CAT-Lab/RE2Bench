The function `_add_method_dunders_unsafe` adds `__module__`, `__qualname__`, and `__doc__` attributes to a method passed to it.
The `__module__` attribute is set to the module of the class.
The `__qualname__` attribute is set to the qualified name of the class plus the name of the method.
The `__doc__` attribute is set to a string describing that the method was generated by attrs for the class.
Finally, the method is returned.
