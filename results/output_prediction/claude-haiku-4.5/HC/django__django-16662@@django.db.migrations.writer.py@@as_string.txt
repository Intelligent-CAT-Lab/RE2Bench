[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `as_string` method step by step:

1. `items = {'replaces_str': '', 'initial_str': ''}`

2. `imports = set()`

3. `operations = []`

4. Loop through `self.migration.operations`:
   - According to the input, `self.migration.operations` is `null` (None)
   - So this loop doesn't execute (None is not iterable in this context, but the code would actually fail)
   
   Wait, let me reconsider. The input shows `"operations": null`. When iterating over None in Python, it would raise a TypeError. However, looking at the code structure, it seems like the code expects operations to be iterable. Let me assume that in the actual execution, operations being None means the loop simply doesn't execute (or we should treat it as an empty list).

5. `items['operations'] = '' + '' = ''` (since operations list is empty)

6. `dependencies = []`

7. Loop through `self.migration.dependencies`:
   - The input doesn't specify dependencies, so assuming it's empty or None
   - This loop doesn't execute

8. `items['dependencies'] = ''`

9. `migration_imports = set()`

10. Loop through imports (empty set):
    - No iterations

11. Check if 'from django.db import models' in imports:
    - It's not, so we add 'from django.db import migrations'
    - `imports = {'from django.db import migrations'}`

12. `sorted_imports = sorted(imports, ...)` 
    - Result: `['from django.db import migrations']`

13. `items['imports'] = 'from django.db import migrations\n'`

14. `migration_imports` is empty, so no additional migration_imports text added

15. `self.migration.replaces` - not specified in input, assuming empty/None:
    - `items['replaces_str'] = ''`

16. `self.include_header` is False:
    - `items['migration_header'] = ''`

17. `self.migration.initial` - not specified in input, assuming False:
    - `items['initial_str'] = ''`

18. Return `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE % items`

The MIGRATION_TEMPLATE is:
```
'%(migration_header)s%(imports)s\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n%(replaces_str)s%(initial_str)s\n    dependencies = [\n%(dependencies)s    ]\n\n    operations = [\n%(operations)s    ]\n'
```

Substituting:
- migration_header: ''
- imports: 'from django.db import migrations\n'
- replaces_str: ''
- initial_str: ''
- dependencies: ''
- operations: ''

Result:
```
'from django.db import migrations\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\n    dependencies = [\n    ]\n\n    operations = [\n    ]\n'
```

Which formatted nicely is:
```
from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
    ]
```
