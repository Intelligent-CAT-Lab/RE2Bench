[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_eval_is_finite` for `cos(phi)**2`.

The expression is `cos(phi)**2`, which is a `Pow` object where:
- base = cos(phi)
- exp = 2

Now let's step through `_eval_is_finite`:

1. First check: `if self.exp.is_negative:`
   - exp = 2, which is not negative, so this condition is False
   - We skip the first if block

2. Next: `c1 = self.base.is_finite`
   - base = cos(phi)
   - cos(phi) is a bounded trigonometric function, so it should be finite
   - c1 = True

3. Check: `if c1 is None:`
   - c1 = True, not None, so we don't return

4. Next: `c2 = self.exp.is_finite`
   - exp = 2, which is a positive integer constant
   - c2 = True

5. Check: `if c2 is None:`
   - c2 = True, not None, so we don't return

6. Final check: `if c1 and c2:`
   - Both c1 and c2 are True, so this condition is True
   - We enter this block

7. Inside the final if: `if self.exp.is_nonnegative or fuzzy_not(self.base.is_zero):`
   - self.exp.is_nonnegative: exp = 2, which is nonnegative, so this is True
   - Since the first part is True, the entire OR condition is True
   - We return True

So the function returns True, since cos(phi)**2 is finite (a bounded value raised to a positive integer power is finite).
