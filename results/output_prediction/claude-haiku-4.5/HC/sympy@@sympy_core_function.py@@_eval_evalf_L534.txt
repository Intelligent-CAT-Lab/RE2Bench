[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_eval_evalf` method step by step with the given input.

Given:
- `self` is a Function object with `nargs` of "{1}"
- `prec` = 30

1. First, the function defines `_get_mpmath_func(fname)` as a nested function.

2. Then it checks: `_eval_mpmath = getattr(self, '_eval_mpmath', None)`
   - Since we're not given that this object has an `_eval_mpmath` method, it will be `None`

3. Since `_eval_mpmath is None`:
   - `func = _get_mpmath_func(self.func.__name__)`
   - `args = self.args`

4. The problem is that we don't have enough information about what `self` is. The input only tells us `nargs` is "{1}", which suggests it's a function with 1 argument, but we don't know:
   - What `self.func.__name__` is
   - What `self.args` contains
   - Whether this object is an `AppliedUndef`

5. Without concrete values for these, let's reason about what would happen:
   - If `self.func.__name__` doesn't correspond to an mpmath function, `func` would be `None`
   - If `func is None`, the code checks for `_imp_` attribute
   - If `_imp_` is also not present or is `None`, the function returns `None`

6. Given that the input doesn't provide sufficient information about the actual function being called or its implementation (`_imp_`), and without specific mpmath function name mapping, the most likely outcome is that `func` will be `None` and there's no `_imp_` defined, so the function will return `None`.

Actually, looking more carefully at the structure, the function will return `None` implicitly when there's an early return or when no explicit return statement is reached with a value. In this case, the function returns `None` at the point where `func is None` and `imp is None`.
