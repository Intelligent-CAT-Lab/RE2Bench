[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_safe_repr` function with the given inputs:

1. `object = "dictionary"` (a string)
2. `context = {"124132985094608": 1}`
3. `maxlevels = null`
4. `level = 1`
5. `changed_only = true`

Step-by-step execution:

1. `typ = type(object) = type("dictionary") = str`

2. Check if `typ in pprint._builtin_scalars`: 
   - `str` is a builtin scalar type, so this condition is True
   - The function returns `(repr(object), True, False)` which is `(repr("dictionary"), True, False)`
   - `repr("dictionary")` returns `"'dictionary'"` (the string with quotes around it)

3. So the return value is `("'dictionary'", True, False)`

The function returns a tuple with three elements:
- The string representation: `"'dictionary'"`
- A boolean `True` indicating it's readable
- A boolean `False` indicating it's not recursive

Since the output should be structured as shown, and the function returns a tuple, the output would be this tuple.
