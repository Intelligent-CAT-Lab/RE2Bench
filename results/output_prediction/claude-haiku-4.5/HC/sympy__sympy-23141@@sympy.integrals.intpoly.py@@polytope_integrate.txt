Looking at this function call, I need to trace through `polytope_integrate` with the given inputs.

**Given inputs:**
- `poly`: `{}` (empty dict)
- `expr`: `"x*y"` (string)
- `clockwise`: `True`

**Execution trace:**

1. First, the function checks `if clockwise:` → True, so it enters this block
2. It checks `if isinstance(poly, Polygon):` → False (poly is a dict)
3. It then checks `elif len(poly[0]) == 2:` 
   - This tries to access `poly[0]`, but `poly` is an empty dict `{}`
   - Accessing `poly[0]` on an empty dict raises a `KeyError`

Since the input dictionary is empty, attempting to access `poly[0]` will fail immediately.

**Error:**
```python
KeyError: 0
```

The function will raise a `KeyError` exception because it attempts to index into an empty dictionary.

```
{
    "output": "KeyError: 0"
}
