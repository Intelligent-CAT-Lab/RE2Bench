<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution of `_mask_nc` with input `eq = "2 - 2*cos(phi)"` and `name = None`.

1. `name = name or 'mask'` → `name = 'mask'` (since name is None)

2. `numbered_names()` creates a generator that yields 'mask0', 'mask1', 'mask2', etc.

3. `names = numbered_names()` initializes the generator

4. A local `Dummy` function is defined that wraps the Dummy class creation with auto-incremented names from the generator

5. `expr = eq` → `expr = "2 - 2*cos(phi)"`

6. `if expr.is_commutative:` - The input is a string "2 - 2*cos(phi)", not a SymPy expression object. Strings don't have an `is_commutative` attribute. This would raise an AttributeError when trying to access `.is_commutative` on a string.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the function signature and how it's being used in the context of sympy, the `eq` parameter should be a SymPy expression, not a string. The input shows `"eq": "2 - 2*cos(phi)"` as a string representation, but in actual execution, this would be parsed/created as a SymPy expression.

Let me assume `expr` is the SymPy expression equivalent of `2 - 2*cos(phi)`. 

7. `expr.is_commutative` - For the expression `2 - 2*cos(phi)`, this is a commutative expression (addition and multiplication are commutative operations, and cosine is commutative). So this should be `True`.

8. `if expr.is_commutative:` evaluates to `True`, so the function returns:
   ```python
   return (eq, {}, [])
   ```

This returns the original equation, an empty dictionary for replacements, and an empty list for nc_syms.

So the output would be:
```
(2 - 2*cos(phi), {}, [])
```

Since `2 - 2*cos(phi)` is a commutative expression (it contains only commutative operations and functions), the early return at line `if expr.is_commutative: return (eq, {}, [])` will execute.

The output structure should be:
```
{
    "output": ["2 - 2*cos(phi)", {}, []]
}
```

Or more precisely, a tuple containing:
- The original expression (or its simplified form)
- An empty dictionary
- An empty list
