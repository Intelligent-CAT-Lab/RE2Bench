Let me trace through the execution of `restify` with `cls = null` (None in Python).

1. The function `restify(cls: Optional[Type]) -> str:` is called with `cls = None`.

2. Inside the function, we enter the try block and check the conditions in order:
   - First condition: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`
   - Since `cls` is `None`, the condition `cls is None` is `True`
   - This branch executes and returns `':py:obj:`None`'`

3. The function returns immediately at this point, so no other conditions are evaluated.

The return value is the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.
