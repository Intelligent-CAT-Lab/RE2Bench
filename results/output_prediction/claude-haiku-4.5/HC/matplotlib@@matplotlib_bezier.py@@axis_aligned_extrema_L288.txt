[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `axis_aligned_extrema`:

1. First, we get `n = self.degree`
   - `self._N = 1`
   - `degree = self._N - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - So `n = 0`

2. Next, we check `if n <= 1:`
   - Since `n = 0`, this condition is `True`
   - Therefore, the function immediately returns `(np.array([]), np.array([]))`
   - The early return happens before any computation of polynomial coefficients or roots

3. The function returns a tuple of two empty numpy arrays.

When converted to the output format, this would be two empty arrays. In numpy/Python representation, `np.array([])` appears as `array([], dtype=float64)` or similar, but in JSON-serializable format, it would be represented as empty lists `[]`.
