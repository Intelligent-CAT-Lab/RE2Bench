[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_get_kernel_params` method step by step:

1. `params = self.kernel_params` - Since `kernel_params` is null/None, params = None
2. `if params is None:` - This is True, so `params = {}` (empty dict)
3. `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':` - The kernel is "polynomial", which is a string (not callable) and not 'precomputed', so this condition is True
4. We iterate through `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` - For "polynomial" kernel, KERNEL_PARAMS should contain the valid parameters for polynomial kernel, which are typically: 'degree' and 'coef0' (and gamma)
5. For each param in KERNEL_PARAMS["polynomial"]:
   - Check if `getattr(self, param) is not None`
   - If not None, add it to params dict
   
   Looking at the input:
   - `self.gamma = null` (None) - skip
   - `self.coef0 = 0.1` (not None) - add `params['coef0'] = 0.1`
   - `self.degree = 3.1` (not None) - add `params['degree'] = 3.1`

6. The method returns params which now contains: `{'coef0': 0.1, 'degree': 3.1}`

The elif condition is not reached because the first if condition was True.

So the returned dictionary should have:
- coef0: 0.1
- degree: 3.1

```
{
    "coef0": 0.1,
    "degree": 3.1
}
