[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `factor_terms` with the input `expr = "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"`.

1. First, `expr = sympify(expr)` is called on the string `"2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"`. This parses the string into a SymPy expression:
   - The expression becomes: `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`
   - Which is: `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`
   - Further factored: `2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`

2. Then `do(expr)` is called with the parsed expression.

3. In the `do` function:
   - The expression is `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`, which is a Mul/Pow/Div structure
   - It's not an Atom, and it's a Basic object
   - It will have `args_cnc` attribute
   - Since it's not a Sum or Integral, we proceed to: `cont, p = expr.as_content_primitive(radical=False, clear=False)`
   
4. The `as_content_primitive` method splits the expression into content (numerical coefficient) and primitive part.
   - For `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`:
   - The content would be 2 (the leading coefficient)
   - The primitive would be `x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`

5. Back in `do`:
   - `p = x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)` which is not an Add (it's a division/Mul)
   - Since `p.args` exists and `p` is not an Add, we go to: `p = p.func(*[do(a) for a in p.args])`
   - This recursively processes the arguments of p

6. Finally: `rv = _keep_coeff(cont, p, clear=False, sign=True)` combines the content back with the primitive part.

7. The denominator `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2` can be factored as `a**2*(x**2 - y**2) = a**2*(x-y)*(x+y)`

So the final simplified form should be:
`2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`

Or more factored: `2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`

The output should be the factored expression. Looking at the logic, the function factors terms and returns a SymPy expression object. The string representation would be something like:
`2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))` or `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)` depending on how it's represented.

Given the `factor_terms` function factors out common terms, it should factor the denominator:
`a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2 = a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`

So the result should be: `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))` or with further factorization of the difference of squares: `2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`

The most likely output representation in SymPy would be:
`2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))`
