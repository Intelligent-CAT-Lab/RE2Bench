I need to trace through the execution of `exptrigsimp` with the input `expr = "sinh(x) + cosh(x)"`.

Let me work through this step by step:

1. **Initial call**: `exptrigsimp("sinh(x) + cosh(x)")`

2. **Inside exptrigsimp**:
   - First, the string `"sinh(x) + cosh(x)"` needs to be converted to a sympy expression
   - The function defines `exp_trig(e)` which tries different rewrites
   - Then calls `bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)` 

3. **String to expression conversion**:
   - The string `"sinh(x) + cosh(x)"` will be parsed into a sympy Add object
   - This creates: `Add(sinh(x), cosh(x))`

4. **First bottom_up call with exp_trig**:
   - `bottom_up` recursively applies `exp_trig` to all subexpressions
   - For each expression, `exp_trig` checks:
     - `choices = [e]` (the expression itself)
     - If `e.has(*_trigs)` (has trig/hyperbolic functions): append `e.rewrite(exp)`
     - Append `e.rewrite(cos)`
     - Return the minimum by `count_ops`

5. **For sinh(x) + cosh(x)**:
   - This has hyperbolic functions
   - `rewrite(exp)` would convert: `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` to exponential form
   - `sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2` and `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2`
   - Sum: `(e^x - e^(-x))/2 + (e^x + e^(-x))/2 = e^x`
   - `rewrite(cos)` would rewrite hyperbolic as cosine: `sinh(x) = -i*sin(i*x)` and `cosh(x) = cos(i*x)`
   
6. **Choosing minimum by count_ops**:
   - Original: `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` has some operation count
   - Exponential form `e^x` is simpler
   - The minimum would be `e^x`

7. **Second bottom_up with function f**:
   - The function `f` processes Mul expressions looking for patterns
   - For simple `e^x`, this may not match any patterns

8. **Check for hyperbolic and trig functions**:
   - After the second bottom_up, the result is checked
   - If still has `HyperbolicFunction`, apply `hyper_as_trig` and `TR2i`
   - If has `TrigonometricFunction`, apply `TR2i`

9. **Final result**:
   - `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` simplifies to `exp(x)` via the exponential rewrite
   - The result would be `exp(x)` which is a sympy Expr object

The output structure asks for `nargs._elements`. Looking at sympy objects:
- `exp(x)` would be an `exp` function with one argument `x`
- The structure seems to be asking for elements of something

However, the structure `nargs._elements` suggests it's looking at internal representation. For an `exp(x)` object:
- `nargs` doesn't exist as a standard attribute
- The result would be a sympy expression

Actually, re-reading the structure, it appears to be asking for the result wrapped in a specific format. Since `exptrigsimp("sinh(x) + cosh(x)")` returns `exp(x)`, and the structure shows `{"nargs": {"_elements": XXX}}`, this seems malformed or the result is being wrapped.

The simplification of `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` is `exp(x)`.
