[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `__eq__` method step by step.

1. The method is called with `self` being a kernel object and `b` being a string "RBF(length_scale=1)"

2. First check: `if type(self) != type(b):`
   - `type(self)` is some Kernel subclass (likely RBF based on the string representation)
   - `type(b)` is `str` (since b = "RBF(length_scale=1)")
   - These types are different, so the condition is True

3. Since `type(self) != type(b)` evaluates to True, the method immediately returns `False`

The comparison fails at the type check because we're comparing a Kernel object with a string, and they are of different types.
