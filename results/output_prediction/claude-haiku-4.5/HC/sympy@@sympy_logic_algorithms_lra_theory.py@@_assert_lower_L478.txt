[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_assert_lower` method step by step with the given inputs.

Initial state:
- `self.result` = None
- `xi` = "x" (a variable)
- `ci` = (0, 0) (a tuple representing a constraint)
- `from_equality` = True
- `from_neg` = False
- `self.run_checks` = False

Step 1: Check `if self.result:` 
- `self.result` is None, which is falsy, so this block is skipped.

Step 2: `self.result = None`
- Sets result to None (it already is None)

Step 3: Check `if ci <= xi.lower:`
- We need to compare ci with xi.lower
- ci = (0, 0)
- xi.lower needs to be known from the input. Looking at the input, xi is "x" but we don't have explicit information about x.lower
- From the context, if xi hasn't been initialized, xi.lower would typically be some default lower bound
- Assuming xi.lower exists and comparing: (0, 0) <= xi.lower
- Without explicit xi.lower value in the input, this is hard to determine. However, typically in such systems, if no lower bound is set, it might be (-inf, 0) or similar
- Let's assume this check is False (the constraint is not already satisfied)

Step 4: Check `if ci > xi.upper:`
- We need xi.upper value
- Similar to xi.lower, this isn't explicitly provided
- If xi.upper hasn't been set, it might be (inf, 0) or similar
- This check would determine if there's a conflict

Step 5: Assuming no immediate return from steps 3-4:
- `xi.lower = ci` - Sets xi.lower to (0, 0)
- `xi.lower_from_eq = from_equality` - Sets this to True
- `xi.lower_from_neg = from_neg` - Sets this to False

Step 6: Check `if xi in self.nonslack and xi.assign < ci:`
- `xi` = "x"
- `self.nonslack` = ["x"] (from input)
- So `xi in self.nonslack` is True
- We need to check `xi.assign < ci`
- xi.assign needs to be known. Without explicit value in input, assume it's some initial value
- If xi.assign < (0, 0), we would call `self._update(xi, ci)`

Step 7: Check `if self.run_checks and ...:`
- `self.run_checks` = False, so this entire block is skipped

Step 8: Return None
- The method returns None

So the function should return None.
