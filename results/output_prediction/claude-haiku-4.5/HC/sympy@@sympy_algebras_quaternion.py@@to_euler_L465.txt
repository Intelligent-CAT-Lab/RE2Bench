<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the `to_euler` method step by step with the given input.

Given:
- `self` is a Quaternion with `_norm = None` and `_real_field = True`
- `seq = "zyz"`
- `angle_addition = True`
- `avoid_square_root = False`

First, the method checks if it's a zero quaternion:
```python
if self.is_zero_quaternion():
    raise ValueError('Cannot convert a quaternion with norm 0.')
```

However, we don't have actual values for `self.a`, `self.b`, `self.c`, `self.d` in the input. The input only provides `_norm` and `_real_field`. Without the actual quaternion components, we cannot compute the norm or determine if it's a zero quaternion.

Since `_norm = None`, the `norm()` method would try to compute:
```python
return sqrt(trigsimp(q.a ** 2 + q.b ** 2 + q.c ** 2 + q.d ** 2))
```

But we don't have values for a, b, c, d provided in the input. The input structure doesn't include the `args` property which contains these quaternion components.

Looking at the input more carefully, it shows:
- `"self"` contains `_real_field` and `_norm`
- But there's no `args` field that would contain the quaternion components

This is a problem because the code tries to access `self.a`, `self.b`, `self.c`, `self.d` through properties that return `self.args[0]`, `self.args[1]`, `self.args[2]`, `self.args[3]`.

Without the quaternion components in the input, the method cannot proceed. It will fail when trying to access the quaternion components.

However, if I interpret the input as incomplete and assume the quaternion exists but we're just missing the data, the method would fail with an AttributeError or KeyError when trying to access `self.args[0]` etc., since `args` is not defined in the input.

Let me assume the most likely scenario: the code will raise an error because `self.args` is not provided in the input structure, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access `self.a`, `self.b`, etc.

Actually, looking at the TYPE_CHECKING section:
```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    @property
    def args(self) -> tuple[Expr, Expr, Expr, Expr]:
        ...
```

This suggests that at runtime, `args` should be available. Since it's not in the input, accessing it would raise an error.

The code will fail when it tries to call `self.is_zero_quaternion()` which calls `self.norm()` which tries to access `self.a`, `self.b`, `self.c`, `self.d`.

This will result in an `AttributeError` or similar error because the quaternion components are not available.

Given this is a prediction task and the input is incomplete/malformed, the function will raise an exception.
