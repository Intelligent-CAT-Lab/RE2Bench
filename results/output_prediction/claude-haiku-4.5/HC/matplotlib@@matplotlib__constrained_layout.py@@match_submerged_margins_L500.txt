[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `match_submerged_margins` with the given inputs:

1. The function is called with:
   - `layoutgrids`: a dictionary with gridspec information
   - `fig`: a Figure object with 2 Axes

2. First, it initializes `axsdone = []`

3. It then iterates through `fig.subfigs` (subfigures). Based on the input, there's a Figure(1000x500) which typically wouldn't have subfigures in this simple case, so this loop likely doesn't add anything to `axsdone`.

4. Next, it creates the `axs` list by filtering axes from `fig.get_axes()`:
   - It filters axes where:
     - `a.get_subplotspec() is not None` (axis has a subplot specification)
     - `a.get_in_layout()` is True (axis is in layout)
     - `a not in axsdone` (axis not already processed)
   
   Based on the input, the figure has 2 Axes. From the GridSpec(1, 2), we can infer there are 2 axes in a 1x2 grid layout. Both should satisfy the conditions, so `axs` will contain 2 axes.

5. Then it iterates through each `ax1` in `axs`:
   - For the first ax (ax1):
     - Gets `ss1 = ax1.get_subplotspec()`
     - Checks if `ss1.get_gridspec() not in layoutgrids`. Since we have "GridSpec(1, 2)" in layoutgrids, this should be in there, so we continue.
     - Gets `lg1 = layoutgrids[ss1.get_gridspec()]`
     - Checks if `len(ss1.colspan) > 1`. For a 1x2 grid with individual axes, each axis should have colspan of length 1 (just one column), so this condition is False.
     - Checks if `len(ss1.rowspan) > 1`. For a 1x2 grid, rowspan should be just 1 (one row), so this condition is False.
   
   - For the second ax (ax2):
     - Same analysis: colspan length is 1, rowspan length is 1, so no modifications.

6. The function returns `axs`, which contains the 2 axes that passed the filtering criteria.

So the output will be a list containing the 2 Axes objects from the figure.
