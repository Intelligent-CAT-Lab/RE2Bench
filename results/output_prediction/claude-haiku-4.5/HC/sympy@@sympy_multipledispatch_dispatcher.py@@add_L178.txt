[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `add` method step by step:

1. The method is called with:
   - `self`: a Dispatcher instance (SymmetricHandler)
   - `signature`: `[<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>]`
   - `func`: some function
   - `on_ambiguity`: ambiguity_warn function

2. First check: `if not signature:` - signature is `[<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>]`, which is not empty, so this is False. Skip this block.

3. Second check: `if any(isinstance(typ, tuple) for typ in signature):` - We iterate through signature. The single element is `<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>`, which is a class (type), not a tuple. So this is False. Skip this block.

4. Third loop: `for typ in signature:` - We iterate through the signature
   - `typ` = `<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>`
   - Check: `if not isinstance(typ, type):` - MatAdd is a class, so `isinstance(typ, type)` is True, so the condition is False. We don't raise TypeError.

5. `self.funcs[signature] = func` - Store the function with the signature as key. But signature is a list `[<class...>]`. In Python, lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys. This would raise a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the code more carefully, the signature parameter should typically be a tuple, not a list. However, the input shows it as a list. When trying to use a list as a dictionary key in `self.funcs[signature] = func`, Python will raise a TypeError because lists are unhashable.

Actually, looking at the usage pattern in the docstring example:
```python
D.add((int, int), lambda x, y: x + y)
```

The signature should be a tuple `(int, int)`, not a list. However, the input provided shows it as a list. When Python tries to execute `self.funcs[signature] = func` where `signature` is a list, it will raise:
`TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`

This error would occur before reaching the `reorder()` call or `_cache.clear()`.

So the function will raise an exception and not complete normally. The output would be an error.
