[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `__call__` step by step.

1. Initial state:
   - `self._scorers = {"score": "EmpiricalCovariance.score"}`
   - `self._raise_exc = False`
   - `estimator = "EmpiricalCovariance()"`
   - `args = ["[[ 0.88895051, -0.94884286, -0.77838201, -0.99349011, -0.74907652]]"]`
   - `kwargs = {}`

2. Initialize `scores = {}` and `cache = None` (since we'll check `_use_cache`)

3. Call `_use_cache(estimator)`:
   - `len(self._scorers) == 1` is True (only "score" key)
   - Returns `False`
   - So `cache = None`

4. Check `_routing_enabled()`:
   - Returns `False` (based on the function definition, defaults to False)
   
5. Since routing is not enabled, we go to the else branch:
   - `common_kwargs = {}` (no kwargs provided)
   - `routed_params = Bunch(**{name: Bunch(score=common_kwargs.copy()) for name in self._scorers})`
   - This creates: `Bunch(score=Bunch(score={}))`
   - No "sample_weight" in kwargs, so that part is skipped

6. Loop through scorers:
   - `name = "score"`, `scorer = "EmpiricalCovariance.score"`
   - Try block executes
   - Check `isinstance(scorer, _BaseScorer)`: `scorer` is a string, so False
   - Goes to else: `score = scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)`
   - This would attempt to call the string as a function, which would raise an exception
   - Since `isinstance(scorer, _BaseScorer)` is False and the scorer is actually a string, trying to call it will raise a TypeError

7. Exception handling:
   - `self._raise_exc = False`, so we don't re-raise
   - Instead: `scores[name] = format_exc()`
   - This stores the exception traceback as a string in `scores["score"]`

8. Return `scores = {"score": "<exception traceback string>"}`

The output will be a traceback string from calling a string object as a function. The traceback would look something like:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
```

Since `_raise_exc = False`, the exception is caught and the traceback is formatted and stored as a string.

```
{
    "score": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"...\", line ..., in __call__\n    score = scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)\nTypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n"
}
```
