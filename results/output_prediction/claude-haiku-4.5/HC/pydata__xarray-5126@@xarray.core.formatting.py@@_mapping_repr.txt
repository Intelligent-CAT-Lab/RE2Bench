<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the `_mapping_repr` function step by step with the given inputs.

Input parameters:
- mapping = {"foo": "bar"}
- title = "Attributes"
- summarizer = {} (empty dict, will be called as a function)
- expand_option_name = "display_expand_attrs"
- col_width = None
- max_rows = None

Step 1: Calculate col_width
Since col_width is None, we call `_calculate_col_width(mapping)` where mapping = {"foo": "bar"}
- col_items = {"foo": "bar"}
- max_name_length = max of lengths of strings in col_items keys: len("foo") = 3
- col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13

Step 2: Get max_rows
Since max_rows is None, we get OPTIONS['display_max_rows']. Based on typical xarray defaults, this is usually 12.

Step 3: Create summary list
- summary = ['Attributes:']

Step 4: Check if mapping is truthy
- mapping = {"foo": "bar"}, so it's truthy
- len_mapping = len(mapping) = 1

Step 5: Check expand_option_name
- _get_boolean_with_default('display_expand_attrs', default=True)
- This calls OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs'] and checks if it's 'default', True, or False
- Typically, this defaults to True

Step 6: Check if len_mapping > max_rows
- len_mapping = 1, max_rows = 12 (assumed default)
- 1 > 12 is False, so we skip this branch

Step 7: Execute else branch
Since the mapping is not empty and len_mapping is not > max_rows and expand_option_name is True:
- summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]

Step 8: Call summarizer
The summarizer is an empty dict {}, so calling it as a function will raise a TypeError.

Wait, looking at the input more carefully, the summarizer is passed as {} (an empty dict). When we try to call it like `summarizer(k, v, col_width)`, this will fail because dicts are not callable.

However, looking at the function signature again and how it's used in the module, the summarizer should be a function. The input shows `"summarizer": {}` which seems unusual. 

Let me reconsider - in the actual code, `summarizer` is a function parameter that gets called. If it's an empty dict in the input, calling it would raise: `TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable`

But wait, let me look at the actual function calls that are provided. Looking at the helper functions provided, I see `summarize_attr` which is a function. But in the input, summarizer is just an empty dict {}.

Given that summarizer is {} and we try to call `summarizer(k, v, col_width)` where k="foo", v="bar", col_width=13, this will raise a TypeError because dict objects are not callable.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem. The input shows summarizer as an empty dict, but that doesn't make sense with how the function works. However, I need to predict what actually happens when this code executes.

When we reach the line:
```python
summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]
```

We try to call `summarizer("foo", "bar", 13)`. Since summarizer is {}, this raises:
`TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable`

So the function would raise an exception before returning anything.

</THOUGHT>

[OUTPUT]
The function will raise a `TypeError` because the `summarizer` parameter is an empty dictionary `{}` and the code attempts to call it as a function on the line:
```python
summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]
```

Specifically: `TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable`

The function does not complete successfully and does not return a string output.

```
{
    "output": "TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable"
}
```
