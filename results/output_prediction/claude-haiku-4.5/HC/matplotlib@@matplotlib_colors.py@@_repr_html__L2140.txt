[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_repr_html_()`:

1. The method calls `self._repr_png_()` to get PNG bytes
2. Inside `_repr_png_()`:
   - Checks if `self._isinit` is False (it is), so it would call `self._init()` - but `_init()` is not implemented, so this would raise `NotImplementedError`
   
However, looking at the input, `_isinit` is `false`, which means `_init()` would need to be called. Since `_init()` raises `NotImplementedError` in the base class, the execution would fail.

But wait - let me reconsider. The input shows `"_isinit": false` which suggests the object hasn't been initialized. When `_repr_html_()` is called:

1. First line calls `png_bytes = self._repr_png_()`
2. In `_repr_png_()`, it checks `if not self._isinit:` which is True (since `_isinit` is false)
3. It tries to call `self._init()`, which raises `NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')`

This would cause an exception to be raised before the method can return anything.

Given that this is an abstract base class and `_init()` is not implemented, calling `_repr_html_()` on an uninitialized instance would raise a `NotImplementedError`.

The execution would fail with an exception.
