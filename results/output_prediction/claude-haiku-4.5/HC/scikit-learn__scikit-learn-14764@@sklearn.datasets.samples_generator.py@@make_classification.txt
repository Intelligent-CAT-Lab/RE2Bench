Let me trace through this step by step:

1. `make_classification` is called with the given kwargs
2. `generator = check_random_state(0)` creates a RandomState with seed 0
3. Validation checks pass (n_informative + n_redundant + n_repeated = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 ≤ 20, and the log2 check passes)
4. weights is None, so weights = [1.0 / 1] * 1 = [1.0]
5. n_useless = 2 - 2 - 0 - 0 = 0
6. n_clusters = 1 * 1 = 1
7. n_samples_per_cluster = [int(50 * 1.0 / 1)] = [50]
8. X is initialized as (50, 2) zeros array, y as (50,) zeros array
9. `_generate_hypercube(1, 2, generator)` generates centroids. With dimension=2 and samples=1, this generates 1 centroid with 2 dimensions
10. centroids are scaled: `centroids *= 2 * 1000000.0` then `centroids -= 1000000.0`
11. Since hypercube=False: `centroids *= generator.rand(1, 1)` and `centroids *= generator.rand(1, 2)`
12. X[:, :2] is filled with random normal data from generator
13. For the single cluster (k=0):
    - start=0, stop=50
    - y[0:50] = 0 (all samples get class 0)
    - X_k = X[0:50, :2]
    - A is a random 2x2 matrix
    - X_k is transformed: X_k = X_k @ A
    - X_k += centroid (which is a scaled version of the hypercube)
14. No redundant features (n_redundant=0)
15. No repeated features (n_repeated=0)
16. No useless features (n_useless=0)
17. flip_y=0, so no flipping
18. shift=0 (not None), so no random shift
19. scale=1, so X *= 1
20. shuffle=False, so no shuffling

The output will be a tuple (X, y) where:
- X is a (50, 2) numpy array with float values
- y is a (50,) numpy array with int values (all 0s)

Since we have random_state=0 and specific transformations, the actual numerical values will be deterministic but complex. The structure will be a tuple with numpy arrays.

For the output, I need to represent this as the function returns a tuple of (X, y).

Given the complexity of generating exact values through random operations, I'll represent the output as a tuple containing two numpy arrays. The key characteristics are:
- X shape: (50, 2)
- y shape: (50,)
- y contains all 0s (since n_classes=1)
- X contains float values derived from the random generation and transformations
