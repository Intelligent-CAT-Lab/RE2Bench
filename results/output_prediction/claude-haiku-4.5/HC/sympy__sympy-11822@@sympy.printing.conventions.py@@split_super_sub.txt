[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `split_super_sub("Fvec")` step by step.

1. Initial setup:
   - text = "Fvec"
   - len(text) = 4, so we don't return early
   - pos = 0
   - name = None
   - supers = []
   - subs = []

2. First iteration of while loop (pos = 0, pos < 4):
   - start = pos + 1 = 1
   - text[0:2] = "Fv" != "__", so start stays 1
   - pos_hat = text.find('^', 1) = -1 (no '^' found)
   - pos_hat = len(text) = 4
   - pos_usc = text.find('_', 1) = -1 (no '_' found)
   - pos_usc = len(text) = 4
   - pos_next = min(4, 4) = 4
   - part = text[0:4] = "Fvec"
   - pos = 4
   - name is None, so name = "Fvec"

3. While loop condition check: pos < len(text) → 4 < 4 is False, so loop exits

4. After the loop:
   - name = "Fvec"
   - m = _name_with_digits_p.match("Fvec")
   - The regex is: `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`
   - "Fvec" has only letters, no digits, so m = None
   - Since m is None (falsy), the if block doesn't execute

5. Return statement:
   - return (name, supers, subs)
   - return ("Fvec", [], [])
