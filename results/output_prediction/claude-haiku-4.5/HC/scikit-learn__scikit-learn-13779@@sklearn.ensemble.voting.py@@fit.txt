[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `fit` method execution step by step:

1. The input shows `self.estimators` is `null` (None)
2. The first check in `fit` is:
   ```python
   if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
       raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')
   ```
   Since `self.estimators` is `None`, this condition is True, and an `AttributeError` will be raised.

3. The error will be raised before any other code in the `fit` method executes.

So the function will raise an `AttributeError` with the message: "Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples"

This means the function does not complete successfully and returns nothing (or rather, raises an exception). The output structure cannot be filled because the method doesn't return anything - it raises an exception instead.

However, since the task asks me to predict the output by filling the structure, I need to reconsider. Looking at the structure provided, it seems the expectation is to show what the object state would be after the method completes. But since an exception is raised, the method never completes normally.

Given the context of the problem, the most accurate representation is that an exception is raised and the method terminates early without modifying the object state beyond what was already there, or in this case, it doesn't return anything at all - it raises an error.

But if I must fill the structure, I should indicate that the estimators field remains null and the method doesn't proceed to set estimators_ and named_estimators_.

The function will raise an `AttributeError` before completing execution. The first validation check in the `fit` method checks:

```python
if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
    raise AttributeError(...)
```

Since `self.estimators` is `null` (None), this condition is True and the method raises an exception immediately, preventing further execution.
