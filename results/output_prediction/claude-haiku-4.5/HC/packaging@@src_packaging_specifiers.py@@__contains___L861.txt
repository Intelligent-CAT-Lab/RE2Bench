[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

1. `__contains__` is called with `item = "<Version('1.0a1')>"`
2. `__contains__` calls `self.contains(item)`, which is equivalent to `self.contains(item, prereleases=None, installed=None)`

3. Inside `contains`:
   - `version = _coerce_version(item)` - This coerces the item to a Version object. Since item is already a Version('1.0a1'), it should return that version object.
   - `if version is None: return False` - version is not None, so we continue
   - `if installed and version.is_prerelease:` - installed is None (falsy), so this condition is False, we don't enter
   - `return bool(list(self.filter([version], prereleases=prereleases)))` - This calls filter with [version] and prereleases=None

4. Inside `filter`:
   - `if prereleases is None and self.prereleases is not None:` 
     - prereleases is None
     - self.prereleases is True (from _prereleases=true)
     - So this condition is True, and `prereleases = self.prereleases` sets `prereleases = True`
   - `if self._specs:` - self._specs is a frozenset(), which is empty, so this is False
   - `else:` - We enter the else block
   - `if prereleases is True:` - Yes, prereleases is True
   - `return iter(iterable)` - This returns an iterator over iterable which is [version]

5. Back in `contains`:
   - `return bool(list(self.filter([version], prereleases=None)))`
   - `list(iter([version]))` = `[version]`
   - `bool([version])` = `True` (non-empty list is truthy)

6. Back in `__contains__`:
   - Returns True

So the output should be True.
