Let me trace through the `to_list` function step by step.

The function signature is `to_list(M)` where M is passed as an SDM object (which is a dict subclass).

From the input:
- M is a dictionary with keys "0" and "1" (which represent row indices)
- M["0"] = {"0": Matrix(...), "1": Matrix(...)} (row 0 with columns 0 and 1)
- M["1"] = {"0": Matrix(...), "1": Matrix(...)} (row 1 with columns 0 and 1)

The function does:
1. `m, n = M.shape` - We need to determine the shape from M. Since M is an SDM object, it should have a shape attribute. From the structure of the data, it appears we have 2 rows (indices 0, 1) and 2 columns (indices 0, 1), so m=2, n=2.

2. `zero = M.domain.zero` - Gets the zero element from the domain.

3. `ddm = [[zero] * n for _ in range(m)]` - Creates a 2x2 matrix filled with zeros. This creates:
   ```
   [[zero, zero],
    [zero, zero]]
   ```

4. Then it iterates through M.items():
   - For i=0, row = {"0": Matrix(...), "1": Matrix(...)}
     - For j=0, e = Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])
       - ddm[0][0] = Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])
     - For j=1, e = Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])
       - ddm[0][1] = Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])
   
   - For i=1, row = {"0": Matrix(...), "1": Matrix(...)}
     - For j=0, e = Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
       - ddm[1][0] = Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
     - For j=1, e = Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])
       - ddm[1][1] = Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])

However, I notice the input doesn't provide M.shape explicitly. Looking at the sparse dictionary structure, the keys "0" and "1" as strings are row indices, and within each row, keys "0" and "1" are column indices. So the shape should be (2, 2) - 2 rows and 2 columns.

The function returns `ddm` which is a list of lists where non-zero elements are placed at their positions:

```
[
    [Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]]), Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])],
    [Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]]), Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])]
]
```

Since the keys are strings in the input but are accessed as integers in the code, the JSON representation would need to convert these. Let me represent this as a proper list structure.
