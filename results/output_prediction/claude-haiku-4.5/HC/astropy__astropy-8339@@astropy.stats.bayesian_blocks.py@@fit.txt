[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `fit` method step by step.

1. First, `validate_input(t, x, sigma)` is called. This method is not shown in the provided code, but based on the context, it should return the validated arrays `t`, `x`, `sigma`.

2. Looking at the input:
   - `t` is a 1D numpy array with 20 elements
   - `x` is a 1D numpy array with 20 elements
   - `sigma` is 0.1 (a scalar)

3. The method checks for various fitness arguments ('a_k', 'b_k', 'c_k') but we don't have visibility into what `self._fitness_args` contains or what `self.fitness()` method does, so I cannot determine the exact computation.

4. However, I notice that the code structure calculates:
   - `edges` by concatenating the first element, midpoints between consecutive t values, and the last element
   - `block_length` from differences
   - Then iterates through R from 0 to N-1
   - For each R, it computes fitness values and finds the best breakpoints
   - Finally, it backtracks through `last` array to find change points
   - Returns `edges[change_points]`

5. The problem is that without knowing:
   - The implementation of `validate_input()`
   - The contents of `self._fitness_args`
   - The implementation of `self.fitness()`
   - We cannot fully simulate the execution

6. However, I notice that critical information is missing:
   - The `self._fitness_args` attribute is referenced but not provided in the input
   - The `self.fitness()` method implementation is not provided
   - The `self.validate_input()` method is not provided

Without these implementations, I cannot accurately predict the output. The function will likely return a numpy array of edge values (change points), but the exact values depend on the fitness function computation which is not visible.

Given the constraints and missing implementations, I can only say that the output should be a numpy array, but I cannot determine the exact values without more information about the fitness calculation.
