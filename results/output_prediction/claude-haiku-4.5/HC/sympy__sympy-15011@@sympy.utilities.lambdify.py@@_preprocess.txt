<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the execution of `_preprocess` with the given inputs.

The method signature is:
```python
def _preprocess(self, args, expr):
```

So we have:
- `self._dummify = False`
- `args = []` (empty list)
- `expr = "sin(x)**2"` (a string)

Now let's trace through the method:

1. First, it checks:
```python
dummify = self._dummify
if not dummify:
    dummify = any((isinstance(arg, Dummy) for arg in flatten(args)))
```

Since `self._dummify = False`, `dummify = False`.
Then it checks if `not dummify` which is `True`, so it evaluates:
`dummify = any((isinstance(arg, Dummy) for arg in flatten(args)))`

`flatten([])` returns `[]` (empty list).
`any()` over an empty sequence returns `False`.
So `dummify = False`.

2. Next:
```python
argstrs = []
```

3. Then it loops through `args`:
```python
for arg in args:
```

Since `args = []`, this loop doesn't execute at all.

4. After the loop:
```python
return (argstrs, expr)
```

Since `argstrs` was initialized as `[]` and nothing was added to it (the loop didn't execute), and `expr` remains `"sin(x)**2"`, the return value is:

```python
([], "sin(x)**2")
```

This is a tuple containing:
- An empty list `[]`
- The string `"sin(x)**2"`
