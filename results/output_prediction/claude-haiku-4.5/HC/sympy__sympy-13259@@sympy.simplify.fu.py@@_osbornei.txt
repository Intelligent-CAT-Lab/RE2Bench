[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_osbornei(e, d)` with the given input.

Given input:
- `e`: an object with `nargs: {}`
- `d`: not explicitly provided, so it will be undefined

Looking at the function:
```python
def _osbornei(e, d):
    def f(rv):
        if not isinstance(rv, TrigonometricFunction):
            return rv
        # ... rest of the logic
    return bottom_up(e, f)
```

The function calls `bottom_up(e, f)` where:
- `e` is the input expression object
- `f` is a nested function that processes trigonometric functions

However, looking at the input more carefully:
- `e` is described as `{"nargs": {}}` which appears to be a dictionary representation
- `d` is not provided in the kwargs, so it would need to be passed as a positional argument

Wait, looking at the input structure again:
```
"args": {
    "e": {"nargs": {}},
}
```

This suggests `e` is being passed but `d` is missing. However, the function signature requires both `e` and `d`.

Actually, re-reading the input format, it seems like only `e` is provided in the args. Since `d` is required but not provided, this would cause a TypeError at runtime. But let's assume `d` should be treated as undefined or None.

Looking at the actual behavior: the function `_osbornei` calls `bottom_up(e, f)`. The `bottom_up` function is a strategy from sympy that applies function `f` recursively to the expression tree.

Given that `e` appears to be a simple object with just `nargs: {}`, and assuming `bottom_up` processes it, the function `f` would be called on this object.

Since `e` (the dict `{"nargs": {}}`) is not an instance of `TrigonometricFunction`, the function `f` would simply return `rv` unchanged in the first condition check.

The `bottom_up` function would then return this unchanged value.

So the output should be the same as the input: `{"nargs": {}}`

However, if we're treating this as a SymPy expression object rather than a plain dict, it would still return the same object since it's not a TrigonometricFunction.
