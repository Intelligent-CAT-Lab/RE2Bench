[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `TRmorrie(rv)` where `rv = "cos(phi)"`.

1. `TRmorrie` returns `bottom_up(rv, f)` where `f` is the inner function defined.

2. `bottom_up("cos(phi)", f)` is called:
   - `rv = "cos(phi)"` (a string)
   - `args = getattr("cos(phi)", 'args', None)` 
   - Since `"cos(phi)"` is a string, it doesn't have an 'args' attribute, so `args = None`
   - Since `args is None` and `nonbasic=False` (default), we go to the else branch
   - `nonbasic` is False, so we don't try to apply `F`
   - We simply return `rv` as is

3. So `bottom_up("cos(phi)", f)` returns `"cos(phi)"`

4. Therefore `TRmorrie("cos(phi)")` returns `"cos(phi)"`

Actually, wait. Looking at the input more carefully, the input shows `"rv": "cos(phi)"` as a string. However, in the context of SymPy, this would typically be a SymPy expression object, not a string literal. But based on the input provided, we're being given a string `"cos(phi)"`.

Since a string doesn't have `.args`, the `bottom_up` function will simply return the string unchanged because:
- `getattr("cos(phi)", 'args', None)` returns `None`
- The condition `if args is not None:` is False
- We go to the else branch
- Since `nonbasic=False`, we skip the try/except block
- We return `rv` unchanged

So the output should be `"cos(phi)"`.
