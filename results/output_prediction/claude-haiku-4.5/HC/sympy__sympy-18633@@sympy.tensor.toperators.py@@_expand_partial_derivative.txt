<THOUGHT>
Looking at the `_expand_partial_derivative` method, I need to trace through the execution:

1. The method is called on a `PartialDerivative` object `self` with attributes `_indices=None`, `_free=None`, `_dum=None`.

2. First line: `args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`
   - This calls `_contract_indices_for_derivative` which returns a tuple of (args, indices, free, dum)
   - However, from the input, we don't have specific information about `self.expr` and `self.variables`
   - Looking at the property definitions: `expr` returns `self.args[0]` and `variables` returns `self.args[1:]`
   - The input shows `args: {}` which is empty, so we cannot determine what `self.expr` and `self.variables` are

3. Since the input structure is incomplete (args is empty), I need to infer what happens. The method would try to access `self.args[0]` and `self.args[1:]` but with no args provided, this would likely cause an IndexError or return empty values.

4. However, looking more carefully at the input format, it seems like the input is providing the initial state of `self` with `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` all set to `None`, but not providing `_args`.

5. The question asks what the output of `_expand_partial_derivative` will be. The return value is `result` which is initially set to `obj` and may be modified.

6. Without knowing what `self.args` contains, the safest assumption based on the input showing the initial state with all None values is that the method would return an object with attributes that are set during execution.

7. Looking at the code flow:
   - `args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(...)` - sets these local variables
   - `obj = self.func(*args)` - creates a new object
   - `obj._indices = indices` - sets obj's _indices
   - `obj._free = free` - sets obj's _free
   - `obj._dum = dum` - sets obj's _dum
   - `result = obj` - initially result points to obj
   - Then there are conditions that might modify result

8. The output structure asks for `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` of the result.

Since the input is incomplete and we cannot execute the actual code without proper `self.args`, but the question format suggests we should predict the output state, and given that we only have None values initially in `self`, the most likely scenario is that after calling `_expand_partial_derivative`, the returned object would have the same structure.

However, without actual values for `self.expr` and `self.variables`, and given the input shows empty args, I cannot definitively trace the execution. But given the structure of the code, the result object's attributes would be set to whatever was returned from `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.

Given the incomplete input, the most reasonable output would be that `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` remain as they were set by the internal method calls, which we cannot determine from the given input.
