[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `parse_email` with input `data = "download-url: VaLuE"`.

1. `data` is a string, so we use `email.parser.Parser(policy=email.policy.compat32).parsestr(data)`
   - This parses the email string "download-url: VaLuE"
   - The parser creates an email message with header "download-url" having value "VaLuE"

2. Initialize `raw = {}` and `unparsed = {}`

3. Iterate through `frozenset(parsed.keys())`:
   - The key is "download-url" (with case)
   - `name = "download-url".lower() = "download-url"`
   - `headers = parsed.get_all("download-url") or [] = ["VaLuE"]`
   - `value = []`
   - `valid_encoding = True`

4. Process headers:
   - `h = "VaLuE"` (a string, not email.header.Header)
   - Since it's a string: `value.append("VaLuE")`
   - `value = ["VaLuE"]`

5. Check if `valid_encoding` is True: Yes, it is

6. Look up `raw_name = _EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING.get("download-url")`
   - The function uses `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` which is not defined in the provided code
   - Based on the context and typical email metadata parsing, "download-url" is likely NOT in the mapping (it's not a standard email header for package metadata)
   - So `raw_name = None`

7. Since `raw_name is None`:
   - `unparsed["download-url"] = ["VaLuE"]`

8. Get payload:
   - `_get_payload(parsed, "download-url: VaLuE")` is called
   - Since source is a str: `payload = msg.get_payload()`
   - The parsed email message has no body (just headers), so `payload = None` or `""`
   - Based on standard email parsing with only headers and no body, `get_payload()` returns `None` or empty string
   - Actually, looking at the code flow, if there's no body, `get_payload()` returns `None`
   - The assertion `assert isinstance(payload, str)` would fail if payload is None
   - Actually, let me reconsider: if there's no body in the email, `get_payload()` might return an empty string `""`
   - Let me assume it returns `""` (empty string) for a message with only headers

9. `payload = ""` (or possibly None, but the assertion suggests it should be a string)
   - Actually, re-reading: if there's no payload, `get_payload()` typically returns None. But the code asserts it's a string.
   - Looking more carefully at email.message.Message behavior: if there's no body, `get_payload()` returns None
   - The try-except catches ValueError, not AssertionError
   - So this would raise an AssertionError... but wait, let me check the logic again
   - Actually, an email with just headers might have `get_payload()` return `None` or `""`
   - Given the assertion, the code expects a string. Let's assume `get_payload()` returns `""` for an email with no body

10. `payload = ""`
    - `if payload:` evaluates to False (empty string is falsy)
    - So we don't enter the if block

11. Return `(cast('RawMetadata', raw), unparsed)`
    - `raw = {}`
    - `unparsed = {"download-url": ["VaLuE"]}`

The output should be:
```
(({}, {"download-url": ["VaLuE"]}))
```

Which is a tuple of (raw metadata dict, unparsed dict).
