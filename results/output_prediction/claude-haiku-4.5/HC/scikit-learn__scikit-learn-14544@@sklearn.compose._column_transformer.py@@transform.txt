[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `transform` method step by step.

1. `check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_')` - This checks if 'transformers_' attribute exists. Since `transformers_` is `null`, this will raise an exception.

However, looking at the code, the `check_is_fitted` function from sklearn will raise a `NotFittedError` when the transformer hasn't been fitted (i.e., when `transformers_` is None/null).

Since the input shows `transformers_: null`, this means the `ColumnTransformer` has not been fitted yet. The `transform` method calls `check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_')` at the very beginning, which will raise an exception because the required attribute `transformers_` is not set (it's null).

The `check_is_fitted` function from sklearn.utils.validation will raise a `NotFittedError` (or `sklearn.exceptions.NotFittedError`) when:
- The estimator hasn't been fitted
- The specified attribute doesn't exist or is None

So when this method is executed, it will raise an exception before proceeding further.

Actually, looking at the import: `from ..utils.validation import check_array, check_is_fitted`

The `check_is_fitted` will check if `transformers_` exists and is not None. Since it's None in the input, this will raise an exception.

The exception will be of type `sklearn.exceptions.NotFittedError` with a message like "This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator."
