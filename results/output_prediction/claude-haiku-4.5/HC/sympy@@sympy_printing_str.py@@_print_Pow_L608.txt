[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_print_Pow` with the given input.

1. The function is called with `expr = sqrt(2)` and `rational = False`

2. `sqrt(2)` is mathematically equivalent to `2**(1/2)`, so it's a `Pow` object with:
   - `expr.base = 2`
   - `expr.exp = S.Half` (which is `Rational(1, 2)`)

3. `PREC = precedence(expr)` - gets the precedence of the Pow expression

4. First condition: `if expr.exp is S.Half and (not rational):`
   - `expr.exp is S.Half` → True (the exponent is 1/2)
   - `not rational` → True (rational=False)
   - This condition is satisfied!

5. So the function returns:
   ```
   'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base)
   ```

6. `expr.base = 2`, so `self._print(2)` needs to be evaluated
   - `2` is a Number (specifically `S(2)` or similar)
   - This will print as `"2"`

7. Therefore, the result is:
   ```
   'sqrt(%s)' % '2' = 'sqrt(2)'
   ```

The function returns early at the first condition and returns `'sqrt(2)'`.
