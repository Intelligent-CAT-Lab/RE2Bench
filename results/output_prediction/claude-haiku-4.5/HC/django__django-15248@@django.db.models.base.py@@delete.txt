<THOUGHT>
Let me trace through the `delete` method execution:

1. The `delete` method is called on a Model instance with:
   - `self.pk = 99998` (not None)
   - `self._state.db = "default"`
   - No `using` parameter passed, so `using = None`
   - `keep_parents = False` (default)

2. First check: `if self.pk is None` - this is False since pk is 99998, so no ValueError is raised.

3. `using = using or router.db_for_write(self.__class__, instance=self)`
   - Since `using` is None, it calls `router.db_for_write()`
   - The router will return the database alias for write operations
   - Given the instance has `_state.db = "default"`, it will return "default"
   - So `using = "default"`

4. `collector = Collector(using=using, origin=self)`
   - Creates a Collector with `using="default"` and `origin=self`
   - Initializes the Collector with empty data structures

5. `collector.collect([self], keep_parents=keep_parents)`
   - Collects the object for deletion
   - This will traverse relationships and build up objects to delete
   - Since this is a simple Model instance without related objects in this scenario, it will just add the object to the collector's data

6. `return collector.delete()`
   - This calls the Collector's delete method which actually performs the SQL DELETE operations
   - The Collector.delete() method (not shown in detail but called here) will:
     - Execute SQL to delete the objects
     - Return a tuple of (number_of_objects_deleted, dict_of_models_and_counts)
   - The return value format is: `(number_of_deleted_objects, {model: count})`

Given that we have one object (the instance itself) and assuming no related objects need to be deleted, the Collector.delete() would return something like:
- `(1, {'app.Model': 1})` - meaning 1 object was deleted

However, looking at the actual implementation, `Collector.delete()` is not provided in the function list, but based on Django's standard behavior, it returns a tuple: `(number_deleted, {model_label: count})`.

For a single object deletion with no cascading deletes needed:
- Number deleted: 1
- Dictionary: Maps model to number of instances deleted

The most likely output would be a tuple like `(1, {'TestModel': 1})` or similar, but without the actual Collector.delete() implementation, the exact format depends on how Django structures the response.

Based on standard Django deletion behavior, the output should be a tuple of (number_of_deleted_objects, dictionary_with_model_counts).
