[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_hstack` method with the given input.

The input shows:
- `self.sparse_output_` = false
- `Xs` = null

Looking at the `_hstack` method:
1. First condition: `if self.sparse_output_:` - This is False, so we skip the sparse handling block
2. We enter the `else` block (dense output handling)
3. Line: `Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]`
   - But `Xs` is null (None), so this will attempt to iterate over None
   - In Python, iterating over None will raise a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

When we try to iterate over `None` in the list comprehension, Python will raise:
`TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`

This error would be raised before any of the subsequent logic could execute.

    "output": "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable"
