[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `prepare_url` method step by step.

Input:
- url = "http://localhost:49515/"
- params = {}

1. Check if url is bytes: No, it's a string
2. url = str(url) = "http://localhost:49515/"
3. url = url.lstrip() = "http://localhost:49515/" (no leading whitespace)
4. Check if ':' in url and not url.lower().startswith('http'): ':' is in url but url starts with 'http', so this condition is False, we don't return early
5. Parse the URL using parse_url:
   - scheme = 'http'
   - auth = None
   - host = 'localhost'
   - port = '49515'
   - path = '/'
   - query = None (or empty string)
   - fragment = None (or empty string)

6. Check if scheme exists: 'http' exists, so no MissingSchema error
7. Check if host exists: 'localhost' exists, so no InvalidURL error
8. Check if host is not ASCII: 'localhost' is ASCII, so unicode_is_ascii returns True
9. Check if host starts with '*' or '.': 'localhost' doesn't, so no error
10. Build netloc:
    - netloc = auth or '' = '' (auth is None)
    - Since netloc is falsy (empty string), we don't add '@'
    - netloc += host = 'localhost'
    - Since port exists (49515), netloc += f':{port}' = 'localhost:49515'

11. path is '/', so path doesn't get set to '/'

12. Check if params is str or bytes: params is a dict {}, so isinstance returns False

13. Call _encode_params(params):
    - params is a dict, which is not (str, bytes), doesn't have "read", but has "__iter__"
    - So we enter the hasattr(data, "__iter__") branch
    - to_key_val_list({}) returns an empty list
    - result = []
    - The for loop doesn't execute since there are no items
    - urlencode([], doseq=True) returns ''
    - enc_params = ''

14. Check if enc_params: enc_params is '', which is falsy, so we don't modify query

15. query is None or empty string. Let me check parse_url behavior - typically for URLs with no query string, query would be None or empty string. Given the URL "http://localhost:49515/", there's no query, so query should be empty or None.

16. Build the URL using urlunparse:
    - scheme = 'http'
    - netloc = 'localhost:49515'
    - path = '/'
    - params = None (third parameter in urlunparse is typically for params, but we're passing None)
    - query = query (which is empty/None)
    - fragment = fragment (which is empty/None)
    - urlunparse([scheme, netloc, path, None, query, fragment])
    
    Actually, looking at the code: `urlunparse([scheme, netloc, path, None, query, fragment])`
    The standard urlunparse takes a 6-tuple, so this would be correct.

17. requote_uri is called on the result

18. The final URL should be: "http://localhost:49515/"

19. self.url is set to this URL

So the output should set self.url to "http://localhost:49515/"

The function modifies the object (self) in place and doesn't return anything explicitly, so it returns None.
