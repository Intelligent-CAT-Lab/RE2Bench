[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__getitem__` method with the input `key = [1, 2]`.

1. The method receives `key = [1, 2]`, which is a list (not a tuple, not a slice, not an int/Integer, not a Symbol/Expr).

2. First condition: `if not isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(key, slice):`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], tuple)` is `False`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], slice)` is `False`
   - So `not False and False` = `True and False` = `False`
   - This condition is not met.

3. Second condition: `if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2:`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], tuple)` is `False`
   - This condition is not met.

4. Third condition: `elif isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer)):`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], (SYMPY_INTS, Integer))` is `False`
   - This condition is not met.

5. Fourth condition: `elif isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr)):`
   - `isinstance([1, 2], (Symbol, Expr))` is `False`
   - This condition is not met.

6. Final condition: `raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)`
   - Since none of the previous conditions match, we reach the final `raise IndexError` statement.
   - This will raise an `IndexError` with the message format "Invalid index, wanted {self}[i,j]"

The method will raise an `IndexError` exception rather than returning a value.
