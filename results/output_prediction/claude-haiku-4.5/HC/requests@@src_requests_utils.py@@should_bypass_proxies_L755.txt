[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step:

1. `should_bypass_proxies` is called with:
   - url = "http://localhost:48329/"
   - no_proxy = None

2. Inside the function:
   - `no_proxy_arg = None` (stores the original no_proxy value)
   - Since `no_proxy is None`, it calls `get_proxy('no_proxy')` which returns `os.environ.get('no_proxy') or os.environ.get('NO_PROXY')`
   - Assuming no environment variables are set for no_proxy, this returns None
   - So `no_proxy = None`

3. `parsed = urlparse("http://localhost:48329/")`
   - This parses the URL. The hostname would be "localhost"

4. Check `if parsed.hostname is None:` 
   - parsed.hostname is "localhost", so this is not None, we don't return True here

5. Check `if no_proxy:` 
   - no_proxy is None, which is falsy, so we skip this entire block

6. Execute the context manager `with set_environ('no_proxy', no_proxy_arg):`
   - This sets the environment variable 'no_proxy' to None (no_proxy_arg value)

7. Inside the try block:
   - `bypass = proxy_bypass(parsed.hostname)` is called with "localhost"
   - `proxy_bypass` is a function from compat that checks if the hostname should bypass proxies
   - For "localhost", the standard behavior of `proxy_bypass` is typically to return True (localhost usually bypasses proxies)

8. If bypass is True, the function returns True

9. If bypass is False, the function returns False

Given that "localhost" is typically considered a local address that should bypass proxies, `proxy_bypass("localhost")` would return True.

Therefore, the function should return True.
