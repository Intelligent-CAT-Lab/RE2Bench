[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `level_up` method step by step.

1. The method is called on an RPGCharacter instance with:
   - name: "John"
   - hp: 140
   - attack_power: 30
   - defense: 20
   - level: 3
   - exp: 0

2. The method checks `if self.level < 100:`
   - Current level is 3, which is less than 100, so we enter the if block

3. Inside the if block:
   - `self.level += 1` → level becomes 3 + 1 = 4
   - `self.exp = 0` → exp stays 0
   - `self.hp += 20` → hp becomes 140 + 20 = 160
   - `self.attack_power += 5` → attack_power becomes 30 + 5 = 35
   - `self.defense += 5` → defense becomes 20 + 5 = 25

4. The method returns a tuple: `(self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense)`
   - This returns: (4, 160, 35, 25)
