[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_mac_arch` with the given inputs:

1. The function is called with:
   - arch = "x86_64"
   - is_32bit = true

2. First condition: `if not is_32bit:`
   - is_32bit is true, so `not is_32bit` is false
   - This condition is not satisfied, so we don't return arch

3. Second condition: `if arch.startswith('ppc'):`
   - arch is "x86_64"
   - "x86_64".startswith('ppc') is false
   - This condition is not satisfied, so we don't return 'ppc'

4. We reach the final return statement: `return 'i386'`
   - Since is_32bit is true and arch doesn't start with 'ppc', the function returns 'i386'
