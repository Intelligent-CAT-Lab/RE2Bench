[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes one parameter `num`.
2. The input provides `num` as a list: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`
3. First operation: `num.append(num[-1])`
   - `num[-1]` accesses the last element of the list, which is `1`
   - `append()` adds this value to the end of the list
   - After this operation, `num` becomes: `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`
4. The function returns `num`, which is now `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`
