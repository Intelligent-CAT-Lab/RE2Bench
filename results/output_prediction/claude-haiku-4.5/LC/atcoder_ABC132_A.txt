[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. The input is `"FFEE"` (a string with 4 characters: F, F, E, E)
2. `s = sorted(input())` sorts the characters in the input string alphabetically.
   - The characters are: F, F, E, E
   - When sorted in ascending order: E, E, F, F
   - So `s = ['E', 'E', 'F', 'F']`

3. Now we check the condition: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[2] == s[3] and (s[0] != s[2]):`
   - `s[0] == s[1]`: 'E' == 'E' → True
   - `s[2] == s[3]`: 'F' == 'F' → True
   - `s[0] != s[2]`: 'E' != 'F' → True
   - All three conditions are True, so the overall condition is True

4. Since the condition is True, the code prints `'Yes'`
