[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to filter elements: `[e for e in l if e > 0]`
3. The input list is: `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`
4. Let's iterate through each element:
   - `-1`: Is -1 > 0? No, so it's not included.
   - `-2`: Is -2 > 0? No, so it's not included.
   - `4`: Is 4 > 0? Yes, so it's included.
   - `5`: Is 5 > 0? Yes, so it's included.
   - `6`: Is 6 > 0? Yes, so it's included.
5. The result is a list containing only the positive elements: `[4, 5, 6]`
