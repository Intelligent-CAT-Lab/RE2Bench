[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The method `update_product_quantity` is called with `product_id=1` and `quantity=-3`.
2. The method checks: `if product_id in self.inventory:`
3. `self.inventory` is a dictionary with keys: `{"1": {...}}` (note: the key is a string "1", not an integer 1)
4. We're checking if `product_id` (which is the integer `1`) is in `self.inventory`
5. Python dictionary membership check: `1 in {"1": {...}}` will be `False` because the key is a string "1", not an integer 1
6. Since the condition is `False`, the code inside the if block does not execute
7. The method returns `None` (implicitly, as there's no return statement)
8. The state of `self.inventory` remains unchanged: `{"1": {"name": "product 1", "quantity": 2}}`

The function doesn't return any value explicitly, so it returns `None`.
