[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

1. The function `f(d)` receives a dictionary `d` as input.
2. From the input, `d = {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`
3. First line: `d = d.copy()` creates a shallow copy of the dictionary. So `d` is now a copy with the same key-value pairs: `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`
4. Second line: `d.popitem()` removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary. In Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order, so `popitem()` removes the last item that was inserted, which is `("x:", 3)`. After this operation, `d` becomes `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`
5. The function returns the modified dictionary `d`, which is `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`

The output structure expects "l" and "t" keys with their values, which matches the returned dictionary.
- "l": 1
- "t": 2

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "l": 1,
    "t": 2
}
