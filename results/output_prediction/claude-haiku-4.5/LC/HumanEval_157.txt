[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.

The function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` checks if the three sides form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

Given inputs:
- a = 10
- b = 6
- c = 8

The function returns True if any of these conditions is satisfied:
1. `a * a == b * b + c * c`
2. `b * b == a * a + c * c`
3. `c * c == a * a + b * b`

Let me evaluate each condition:

1. `a * a == b * b + c * c`
   - Left side: 10 * 10 = 100
   - Right side: 6 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 36 + 64 = 100
   - 100 == 100 is True ✓

Since the first condition is True, the entire expression evaluates to True and the function returns True.

(We don't need to check the other conditions since we're using `or` and already found one True condition)
