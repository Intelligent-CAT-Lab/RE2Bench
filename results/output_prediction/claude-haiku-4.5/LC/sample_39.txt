[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the function `f` step by step.

The function `f` takes two parameters:
- `array`: [6, 2, 7, 1]
- `elem`: 6

Step 1: Check if `elem` is in `array`
- We check if 6 is in [6, 2, 7, 1]
- 6 is indeed in the array (it's at index 0)
- So the condition `if elem in array:` evaluates to True

Step 2: Since the condition is True, we execute the return statement inside the if block
- We return `array.index(elem)`
- `array.index(6)` returns the index of the first occurrence of 6 in the array
- The index of 6 in [6, 2, 7, 1] is 0 (0-indexed)

Step 3: The function returns 0
