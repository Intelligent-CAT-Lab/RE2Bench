[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `write_csv(data=[["a", "b", "c", "d"], ["ME"]], file_name="read_test_process.csv")` is called.

2. The function enters a try-except block.

3. Inside the try block:
   - It opens a file named "read_test_process.csv" in write mode with newline=''
   - Creates a csv.writer object
   - Calls `writer.writerows(data)` which writes the two rows:
     - Row 1: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
     - Row 2: ["ME"]
   
4. The file is successfully written (assuming normal file system conditions where the file can be created/written).

5. After the file is written successfully, the function returns 1 (indicating success).

6. If any exception occurred during file writing, it would return 0, but in this case, there are no exceptions expected - the data is valid and the filename is valid.

Therefore, the function will return 1.
