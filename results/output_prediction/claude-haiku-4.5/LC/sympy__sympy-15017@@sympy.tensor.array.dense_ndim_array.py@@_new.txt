[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `_new` method step by step:

1. The method is called with:
   - `cls` = ImmutableDenseNDimArray (a class)
   - `iterable` = an object with `rows=2, cols=2, _mat=null` (appears to be a Matrix-like object)
   - `shape` = null
   - `kwargs` = {}

2. First line: `shape, flat_list = cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)`
   - This calls `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` which is inherited from DenseNDimArray/NDimArray
   - When iterable is a Matrix-like object with rows=2, cols=2, this would extract the shape as (2, 2)
   - The flat_list would be the flattened elements of the 2x2 matrix
   - However, looking at the input, `_mat` is null, so we need to consider what a 2x2 matrix with no elements would flatten to
   - Without seeing the actual matrix data, and given `_mat` is null, the flat_list would likely be empty or contain default values
   - For a 2x2 matrix, shape would be (2, 2)

3. `shape = Tuple(*map(_sympify, shape))`
   - This converts shape to a Tuple of sympified elements: (2, 2)

4. `flat_list = flatten(flat_list)`
   - Flattens the flat_list (though it may already be flat)

5. `flat_list = Tuple(*flat_list)`
   - Converts flat_list to a Tuple

6. `self = Basic.__new__(cls, flat_list, shape, **kwargs)`
   - Creates a new instance

7. `self._shape = shape`
   - Sets _shape to (2, 2)

8. `self._array = list(flat_list)`
   - Converts flat_list Tuple to a list

9. `self._rank = len(shape)`
   - For shape (2, 2), rank = 2

10. `self._loop_size = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, shape, 1)`
    - Multiplies all dimensions: 1 * 2 * 2 = 4

Since we don't have exact details about what the flat_list contains (the matrix elements), and `_mat` is null, the _array would likely be an empty list or a list with default/zero values. For a 2x2 matrix it would have 4 elements total.

Given the incomplete information about the actual matrix data, the most reasonable assumption is that flat_list would be empty or contain symbolic zeros, resulting in an empty list or list with 4 elements.

The _shape would be represented as a Tuple object, _rank would be 2, and _loop_size would be 4.
