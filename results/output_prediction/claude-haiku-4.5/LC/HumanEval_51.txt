[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `remove_vowels` takes a text parameter: "abcdef\nghijklm"
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character `s` in the text
3. For each character, it checks if `s.lower()` is NOT in the list ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
4. Only characters that are NOT vowels are kept

Let me go through each character:
- 'a': s.lower() = 'a', which IS in vowels, so it's excluded
- 'b': s.lower() = 'b', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'b'
- 'c': s.lower() = 'c', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'c'
- 'd': s.lower() = 'd', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'd'
- 'e': s.lower() = 'e', which IS in vowels, so it's excluded
- 'f': s.lower() = 'f', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'f'
- '\n': s.lower() = '\n', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → '\n'
- 'g': s.lower() = 'g', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'g'
- 'h': s.lower() = 'h', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'h'
- 'i': s.lower() = 'i', which IS in vowels, so it's excluded
- 'j': s.lower() = 'j', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'j'
- 'k': s.lower() = 'k', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'k'
- 'l': s.lower() = 'l', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'l'
- 'm': s.lower() = 'm', which is NOT in vowels, so it's included → 'm'

5. The ''.join() concatenates all the kept characters together
6. Result: "bcdf\nghjklm"
