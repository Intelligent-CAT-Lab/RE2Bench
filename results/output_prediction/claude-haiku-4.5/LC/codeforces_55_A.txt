[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. `n = int(input())` - The input is "9", so `n = 9`
2. `while n % 2 == 0:` - Check if n is divisible by 2
   - `9 % 2 = 1`, which is not equal to 0
   - The condition is False, so we don't enter the while loop
3. `if n == 1:` - Check if n equals 1
   - n is still 9, so `9 == 1` is False
4. Since the if condition is False, we execute the else branch: `print('NO')`

The output will be "NO"
