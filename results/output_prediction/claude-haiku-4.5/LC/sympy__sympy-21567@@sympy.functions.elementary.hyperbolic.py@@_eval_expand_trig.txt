[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_eval_expand_trig` method on a `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction` object.

1. The method is defined as:
```python
def _eval_expand_trig(self, **hints):
    return self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)
```

2. The method calls `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)` where `hints` is an empty dict since no kwargs are provided.

3. However, looking at the provided code, I notice that the `_calculate_reciprocal` method is NOT defined in the `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction` class shown. The class only defines:
   - `_reciprocal_of = None`
   - `_is_even = None`
   - `_is_odd = None`
   - `_eval_expand_trig` method

4. Since `_calculate_reciprocal` is not defined in the provided code, calling this method would result in an `AttributeError` at runtime. However, the question asks for the output based on the given input.

5. Looking at the input structure, it appears to be incomplete or the method definition is incomplete. The `_calculate_reciprocal` method is being called but not defined.

6. Without the implementation of `_calculate_reciprocal`, I cannot determine what this method returns. The code snippet provided is incomplete - it's just the class definition stub without the full implementation.

Since the code is incomplete and `_calculate_reciprocal` is not defined, this would raise an `AttributeError`. However, if I assume the question expects the structure to be preserved as-is (since nothing modifies the object structure shown), the output would maintain the same structure.

Given that the input object structure is:
```
{
    "nargs": {
        "_args_set": "{'1'}"
    }
}
```

And no actual transformation occurs (or an error would be raised), the return value would be whatever `_calculate_reciprocal` returns, which is undefined in the provided code.

```
{
    "nargs": {
        "_args_set": null
    }
}
