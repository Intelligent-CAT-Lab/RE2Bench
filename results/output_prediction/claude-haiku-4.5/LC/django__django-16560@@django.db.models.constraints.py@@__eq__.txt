[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method step by step:

1. The method is called with `self` being a CheckConstraint and `other` being another CheckConstraint (from the input).

2. First, it checks `if isinstance(other, CheckConstraint):` - Since `other` has the same structure as `self` (both have check, name, violation_error_code, violation_error_message), this condition is True.

3. Now it evaluates the return statement:
   `return self.name == other.name and self.check == other.check and (self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code) and (self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message)`

4. Let's check each comparison:
   - `self.name == other.name`: Both are "price", so this is True
   - `self.check == other.check`: Both have identical structure (children: null, connector: "AND", negated: false), so this is True
   - `self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code`: Both are "custom_code", so this is True
   - `self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message`: Both have the same _proxy____args and _proxy____kw dictionaries, so this is True

5. Since all four comparisons are True, and they're all connected with `and`, the overall result is True.
