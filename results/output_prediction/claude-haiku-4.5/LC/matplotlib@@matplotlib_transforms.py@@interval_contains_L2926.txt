[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `interval_contains`:

1. The function receives:
   - `interval` = "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])" (a string representation)
   - `val` = -80.0

2. First line: `a, b = interval`
   - This tries to unpack the string "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])" into two variables
   - When you unpack a string, it iterates over characters
   - The string has many characters, so this will fail with a ValueError: "too many values to unpack"
   
Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the input more carefully, the interval is given as a string representation of a numpy array. However, Python's tuple unpacking on a string would iterate character by character, which would fail.

Actually, I need to reconsider the input format. The input shows `"interval": "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"` which is a string. When we try `a, b = interval` on this string, Python will attempt to unpack it.

A string cannot be unpacked into exactly 2 values if it has more than 2 characters. This will raise a `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)`.

However, let me check if this is meant to be interpreted differently. Looking at the structure of similar examples, it seems like the input representation might be showing the actual values that would be passed.

Actually, re-reading the input, it says the interval is the string `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"`. If we try to unpack this string with `a, b = interval`, we're trying to unpack a string with many characters into 2 variables, which will fail.

But wait - perhaps the JSON representation is meant to show what the actual Python object would be. Let me assume the interval is actually a tuple or list: `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]`

If interval = [-107.73502692, -7.73502692]:
- a = -107.73502692
- b = -7.73502692
- Check if a > b: -107.73502692 > -7.73502692? No, so no swap needed
- a = -107.73502692, b = -7.73502692
- Return: a <= val <= b
- Return: -107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692?
- Is -107.73502692 <= -80.0? Yes (True)
- Is -80.0 <= -7.73502692? No (False)
- True and False = False

So the output should be False.
