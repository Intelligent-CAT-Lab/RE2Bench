[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `precision_recall_curve` with the given inputs:

1. `y_true = null`, `probas_pred = null`, `pos_label = 1`, `sample_weight = null`

2. The function calls `_binary_clf_curve(y_true, probas_pred, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None)`

3. Inside `_binary_clf_curve`:
   - `y_type = type_of_target(y_true)` where `y_true = null`
   - In `type_of_target`, it checks if y is valid with: `isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')` and not a string
   - Since `y_true = null` (None in Python), it doesn't satisfy these conditions
   - So it raises `ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y)` with y being None

4. This ValueError will propagate up and terminate the execution.

The function will raise a ValueError before it can return anything.

Actually, let me reconsider - the input shows `null` which in JSON represents None. When None is passed as y_true, the `type_of_target` function will check:
- `isinstance(None, (Sequence, spmatrix))` = False
- `hasattr(None, '__array__')` = False
- So `valid = False`
- This raises `ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % None)`

The execution will fail with an exception, so there is no normal return value.

However, since the problem asks for output prediction and the structure shows we need to provide an output, and given that this will raise an exception, the function does not complete successfully and returns nothing - it raises an exception instead.
