[THOUGHT]
1. The `vector_part` method is called on a Quaternion object.
2. Looking at the method:
```python
def vector_part(self) -> Quaternion:
    return Quaternion(0, self.b, self.c, self.d)
```

3. To execute this, I need to determine the values of `self.b`, `self.c`, and `self.d`.

4. From the input, the Quaternion object has `_real_field=true` and `_norm=null`, but I need to look at `self.args` to get b, c, d.

5. Looking at the properties:
   - `b` returns `self.args[1]`
   - `c` returns `self.args[2]`
   - `d` returns `self.args[3]`

6. The input shows `"args": {}` which appears to be empty. However, this seems incomplete. In a normal Quaternion, args would be a tuple of 4 elements (a, b, c, d).

7. Since the input args is empty/not provided with actual values, and the code is asking what `vector_part()` returns, I need to infer what the quaternion represents.

8. Given the input structure doesn't provide actual args values, this appears to be a degenerate case. However, based on the pattern, if we assume this is a quaternion that was created without specifying b, c, d explicitly in the input (they would default to 0 in the __new__ method via `map(sympify, (a, b, c, d))` with defaults of 0).

9. So self.b, self.c, self.d would all be 0 (after sympify).

10. Therefore, `vector_part()` would call `Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 0)` which creates a quaternion with all zero components.

11. The return type is a Quaternion object. The output should represent this quaternion, likely as a Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 0).
