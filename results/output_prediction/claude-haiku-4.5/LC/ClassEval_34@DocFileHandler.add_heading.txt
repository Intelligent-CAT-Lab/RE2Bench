[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution of the `add_heading` method:

1. `self.file_path` is set to "test_example.docx"
2. `add_heading` is called with `heading="Test Heading 5"` and `level=1` (default)
3. Inside the try block:
   - `doc = Document(self.file_path)` attempts to load a Document from "test_example.docx"
   - `doc.add_heading(heading, level)` attempts to add a heading to the document
   - `doc.save(self.file_path)` attempts to save the document back to the file

Since this is a prediction task and we're asked to determine the output without actually executing the code, we need to consider what would happen:

The method has a try-except block that catches all exceptions and returns False if any exception occurs. The method returns True if successful.

However, the key issue is: does the file "test_example.docx" exist? The input doesn't indicate that this file exists in the system. If the file doesn't exist, `Document(self.file_path)` will raise a FileNotFoundError or similar exception, which will be caught by the bare `except:` clause, and the method will return `False`.

If the file did exist, the method would add the heading and return `True`. But given no indication that the file exists, the most likely outcome is that an exception will be raised and caught, returning `False`.

The output would be: `False`
