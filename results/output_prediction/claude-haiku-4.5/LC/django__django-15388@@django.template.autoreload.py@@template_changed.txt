[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `template_changed` step by step:

1. The function is called with:
   - `sender`: null
   - `file_path`: "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html"
   - `kwargs`: {}

2. First, check if `file_path.suffix == '.py'`:
   - `file_path` = Path("/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html")
   - `file_path.suffix` = ".html"
   - ".html" == ".py" is False, so we don't return here

3. Next, we iterate through `get_template_directories()`:
   - This function returns a set of template directories from all Django template engines
   - In the input, we don't have specific information about configured template engines, but the function will call `engines.all()`
   - Since this is a test environment, we need to determine what template directories would be returned
   - Looking at the file path: "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html"
   - The key part is checking if any `template_dir` is in `file_path.parents`

4. `file_path.parents` for "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html" would be:
   - PosixPath('/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates')
   - PosixPath('/testbed/tests/template_tests')
   - PosixPath('/testbed/tests')
   - PosixPath('/testbed')
   - PosixPath('/')

5. The loop checks: `if template_dir in file_path.parents:`
   - This checks if any template directory returned by `get_template_directories()` is a parent of the file_path
   - Given that the file is at "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html", the directory "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates" is likely a configured template directory
   - So when we find a match, we call `reset_loaders()` and `return True`

6. Since the file is an .html file in a templates directory (typical Django structure), we should find a matching template_dir in file_path.parents, which would cause the function to return True.

Given the typical Django setup and the file path being in a templates directory, the function should return `True`.
