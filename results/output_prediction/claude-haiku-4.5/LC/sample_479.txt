[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of this function step by step.

Initial state:
- `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- `pop1 = 2`
- `pop2 = 4`

Step 1: `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)`
- This is `nums.pop(2 - 1)` = `nums.pop(1)`
- `pop(1)` removes the element at index 1 from the list
- Index 1 in `[1, 2, 3]` is the element `2`
- After this operation: `nums = [1, 3]`

Step 2: `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)`
- This is `nums.pop(4 - 1)` = `nums.pop(3)`
- `pop(3)` attempts to remove the element at index 3
- However, after the first pop, `nums = [1, 3]` which has only 2 elements (indices 0 and 1)
- Index 3 is out of bounds, so this will raise an `IndexError`

Wait, let me reconsider. The function will raise an IndexError when trying to pop index 3 from a list with only 2 elements. However, the question asks for the output. In Python, when an IndexError is raised, the function terminates with an exception. 

But looking at the structure, it seems we need to provide an output. Let me think about this differently - perhaps the intention is to show what happens when the error occurs. However, typically we'd need to catch the exception or handle it. Since the function doesn't handle the exception, it will raise an IndexError.

Given the format requested, the most accurate representation would be that an error occurs. However, if I must provide a value, the function will crash with an IndexError.
