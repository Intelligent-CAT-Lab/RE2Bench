[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code:

1. The `__invert__` method is called on a Permutation object
2. Looking at the input, `self._array_form` is `null` (None in Python)
3. The method calls: `return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`

4. `_af_new` is defined as `_af_new = Perm._af_new`, which means it's the class method `_af_new` from the `Permutation` class

5. However, there's a problem: `_af_invert(self._array_form)` is being called with `self._array_form = None`

6. Looking at the provided code, `_af_invert` is not defined in the provided snippet. This is being called as a function, but it's not imported or defined anywhere in the visible code.

7. Since `_af_invert` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and `self._array_form` is `None`, the function would attempt to call `_af_invert(None)`.

8. However, since `_af_invert` is not defined in the provided code, this would raise a `NameError`. But the question asks me to predict the output based on what's given.

Looking more carefully, this appears to be an incomplete code snippet. The function `_af_invert` should be defined elsewhere in the full sympy library, but it's not provided here. 

Since I'm asked to predict output and the code references undefined functions and the `_array_form` is None, the most likely scenario is that:
- Either this would raise an error (NameError for undefined `_af_invert`)
- Or I should assume the function would process None somehow

Given that the return type should be a Permutation object (since `_af_new` creates one), and assuming the hidden `_af_invert` function can handle None input, the result would be a new Permutation object created by `_af_new`.

However, without the full code, I cannot determine the exact `_array_form` and `_size` values of the returned object. The `_size` of the inverted permutation would likely match the original `_size` of 5.

Since I don't have enough information about what `_af_invert(None)` returns and what `_af_new` does exactly, I should note that the code has missing dependencies.

But let me reconsider: The output structure asks for `_array_form` and `_size`. If this is asking what the inverted permutation would have, and given that `_array_form` is currently None, calling invert on it would likely fail or produce an undefined result with the information given.

Given the incomplete information, the most reasonable prediction is that this would result in an error, but if I must provide values, a permutation inversion of a None/identity-like permutation of size 5 would likely return itself or an identity permutation, keeping `_size` as 5.
