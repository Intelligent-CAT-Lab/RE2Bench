[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_simple_power` with the given inputs:

Given: x = 1, n = 1

1. First, we check the condition `if n == 1:`
   - n is 1, so this condition is True
   
2. When n == 1, the function returns `x == 1`
   - x is 1, so `x == 1` evaluates to True
   
3. The function returns True immediately without executing the rest of the code (the while loop is never reached)

So the output is True.
