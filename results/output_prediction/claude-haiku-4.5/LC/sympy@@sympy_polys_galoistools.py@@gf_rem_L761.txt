[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `gf_rem(f, g, p, K)` with the given inputs:

1. `gf_rem` calls `gf_div(f, g, p, K)` and returns the second element (remainder) of the tuple.

2. `gf_div([2, 0], [1, 0, 1], 3, ZZ)` is called.

3. Inside `gf_div`:
   - `df = gf_degree([2, 0])` = 1 (degree of polynomial with coefficients [2, 0])
   - `dg = gf_degree([1, 0, 1])` = 2 (degree of polynomial with coefficients [1, 0, 1])
   - Check: `if not g` - g is not empty, so continue
   - Check: `elif df < dg` - 1 < 2 is True, so return `[], f` which is `[], [2, 0]`

4. Since `df < dg` is true, the function returns early with `([], [2, 0])`.

5. `gf_rem` returns the second element of this tuple, which is `[2, 0]`.

So the output should be `[2, 0]`.
