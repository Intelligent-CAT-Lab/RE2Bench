[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. `stdin = input()` reads the input. The input provided is `"BBA"` (with quotes as part of the string literal in the JSON).
2. `s = stdin` assigns this to `s`, so `s = "BBA"` (the actual string value without the JSON quotes).
3. `result = 'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'`
   - This checks if both 'A' and 'B' are in the string `s`
   - 'A' in "BBA"? Yes, 'A' is present at index 2
   - 'B' in "BBA"? Yes, 'B' is present at indices 0 and 1
   - Since both conditions are True, the result is 'Yes'
4. `print(result)` outputs 'Yes'
