[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

1. The function `maximum(arr, k)` is called with:
   - `arr = [-4, 4]`
   - `k = 2`

2. First, we check `if k == 0:`. Since `k = 2`, this condition is False, so we don't return an empty list.

3. Next, `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order:
   - `arr = [-4, 4]` becomes `arr = [-4, 4]` (already sorted)

4. Then, `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements from the sorted array:
   - `arr[-2:]` means the last 2 elements of `[-4, 4]`
   - This gives us `[-4, 4]`

5. The function returns `ans = [-4, 4]`
