[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a RPGCharacter instance with:
   - name: "John"
   - hp: 100
   - attack_power: 20
   - defense: 10
   - level: 1
   - exp: 0

2. The heal() method is called with no arguments.

3. Inside heal():
   - self.hp += 10 → self.hp = 100 + 10 = 110
   - Check if self.hp > 100: 110 > 100 is True
   - So self.hp = 100 (capped at maximum)
   - Return self.hp which is 100

Therefore, heal() will return 100.
