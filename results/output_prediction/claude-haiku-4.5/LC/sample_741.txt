[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of function `f` with the given inputs.

Given:
- `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]`
- `p = 6`

Step-by-step execution:
1. `prev_p = p - 1` → `prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5`
2. Check if `prev_p < 0`: Is `5 < 0`? No, this is False.
3. Since the condition is False, we skip the if block and don't reassign `prev_p`.
4. `return nums[prev_p]` → `return nums[5]`
5. Looking at the list `[6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` with 0-based indexing:
   - Index 0: 6
   - Index 1: 8
   - Index 2: 2
   - Index 3: 5
   - Index 4: 3
   - Index 5: 1
   - Index 6: 9
   - Index 7: 7
6. `nums[5] = 1`

The function returns `1`.
