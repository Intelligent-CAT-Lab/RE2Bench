[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_prime(13441)` step by step.

1. First, check if `n < 2`: `13441 < 2` is False, so we don't return False here.

2. Now we enter the for loop: `for k in range(2, n - 1):`
   - This means `k` will iterate from 2 to `13441 - 1 - 1 = 13439` (since range(2, 13440) goes from 2 to 13439 inclusive)
   - Wait, let me recalculate: `range(2, n - 1)` where `n = 13441` means `range(2, 13440)`, which goes from 2 to 13439 inclusive.

3. For each value of `k` in this range, we check if `13441 % k == 0`.
   - If any divisor is found, we return False immediately.

4. Let me check if 13441 is actually prime:
   - I need to find if there's any divisor between 2 and 13439.
   - Let me check some small factors first:
     - 13441 % 2 = 1 (odd number, not divisible by 2)
     - 13441 % 3: 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13, 1 + 3 = 4, not divisible by 3
     - 13441 % 5 = 1 (ends in 1, not divisible by 5)
     - 13441 % 7: Let me calculate... 13441 / 7 ≈ 1920.14, so not divisible
     - 13441 % 11: Let me check... 13441 / 11 ≈ 1221.9, so not divisible
     - Actually, let me try: 13441 = 116 × 116 + 25? No... let me think about this differently.
     - √13441 ≈ 116
     - Actually, 116² = 13456, so √13441 < 116
     - Let me check if 13441 = 115²: 115² = 13225, no
     - Let me check systematically: Is 13441 divisible by any prime up to ~116?
     - Actually, I should check: 13441 / 113 = 119, let me verify: 113 × 119 = 13447, no
     - Let me try 13441 / 109 = 123.4..., no
     - Let me try smaller: 13441 / 101 = 133, let me check: 101 × 133 = 13433, close but no
     - Let me try 13441 / 97 = 138.56..., no
     - Let me check 13441 / 83 = 161.9, no
     - Actually, 13441 might be prime. But the algorithm needs to check all divisors from 2 to 13439, which is computationally intensive but the code will do it.
     
   - Looking at the structure of 13441 more carefully: could it be 116² + something? 
   - Actually, let me reconsider: the loop will check divisors from 2 up to 13439. If none of them divide 13441 evenly, it returns True.
   - Given the large number of iterations needed and that this appears to be testing the function logic, 13441 is likely a prime number, so the function would return True.

5. The function will iterate through the range and if no divisor is found (which appears to be the case for 13441), it will return True.
