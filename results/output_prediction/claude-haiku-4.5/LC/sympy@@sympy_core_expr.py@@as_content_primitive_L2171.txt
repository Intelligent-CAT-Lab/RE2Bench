[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `as_content_primitive` method:

1. The method `as_content_primitive` is called on an `Expr` object with parameters:
   - `radical=False` (default)
   - `clear=False` (passed as argument)

2. Looking at the method definition:
```python
def as_content_primitive(self, radical=False, clear=True):
    return (S.One, self)
```

3. The method simply returns a tuple containing:
   - `S.One` - which is the SymPy singleton for the integer 1
   - `self` - which is the Expr object itself

4. The parameters `radical` and `clear` are defined in the signature but are not actually used in the method body. So even though `clear=False` is passed, it doesn't affect the return value.

5. `S.One` represents the symbolic integer 1 in SymPy.

6. The return value is a tuple: `(S.One, self)`

Since we're asked for the output structure, and the method returns `(S.One, self)`, the output would be a tuple with two elements. However, given the input structure shows the object has `nargs: "{1}"` (which suggests it might be a simple expression), the return is simply the tuple `(S.One, self)`.

In JSON representation, this would be represented as a tuple/list with two elements where the first is the integer 1 (represented as S.One) and the second is the object itself.
