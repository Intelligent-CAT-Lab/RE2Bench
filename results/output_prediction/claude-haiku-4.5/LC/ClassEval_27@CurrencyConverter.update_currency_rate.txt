[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `update_currency_rate`:

1. The method is called with `currency="CNY"` and `new_rate=7.18`
2. The method checks `if currency not in self.rates:`
3. Looking at self.rates, we have: `{"USD": 1.0, "EUR": 0.85, "GBP": 0.72, "JPY": 110.15, "CAD": 1.23, "AUD": 1.34, "CNY": 7.18, "KRW": 1308.84}`
4. "CNY" IS in self.rates, so the condition `currency not in self.rates` is False
5. We skip the `return False` statement
6. We execute `self.rates[currency] = new_rate`, which sets `self.rates["CNY"] = 7.18`
7. Since there is no explicit return statement after this assignment, the function returns `None`
