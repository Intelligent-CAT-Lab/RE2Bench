[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a float parameter `number` with value `1.33`
2. The function performs the operation: `number % 1.0`
3. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder after division
4. `1.33 % 1.0` calculates the remainder when 1.33 is divided by 1.0
5. 1.33 divided by 1.0 gives 1 with a remainder of 0.33
6. So `1.33 % 1.0 = 0.33`
7. The function returns `0.33`

This operation effectively extracts the fractional part of a number by getting the remainder after dividing by 1.0.
