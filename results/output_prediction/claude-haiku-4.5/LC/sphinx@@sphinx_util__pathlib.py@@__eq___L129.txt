[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__eq__` method step by step:

1. The method signature is `__eq__(self, other: object) -> bool`
2. The input shows `other` is a string representation: `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`
   - Wait, looking more carefully at the input, `other` is given as a string that looks like a representation of a _StrPath object. But in reality, the actual value being passed would be that string itself or an object.
   - Looking at the input format, it appears `other` is the string: `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`

3. Now let's evaluate the conditions:
   - First check: `if isinstance(other, PurePath):`
     - `other` is a string, not a PurePath instance, so this is False
   
   - Second check: `if isinstance(other, str):`
     - `other` is indeed a string (the string representation), so this is True
     - This branch executes:
       - A warning is issued with `RemovedInSphinx10Warning`
       - The return value is: `self.__str__() == other`
       - This compares the string representation of self with the string `other`
       - Since we don't have the actual path of self, and `other` is the literal string `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`, they would not be equal (the string representation of a _StrPath object would be just the path, not include the class name)

4. The return value should be False (since self.__str__() would return something like '/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html', which is not equal to the full string "_StrPath(...)")

Actually, let me reconsider. The `self` object in the input is empty `{}`, which doesn't give us much information about what the actual path is. However, the comparison would be between `self.__str__()` (which would be the path string) and the string `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`. These would not be equal.

So the output should be `False`.
