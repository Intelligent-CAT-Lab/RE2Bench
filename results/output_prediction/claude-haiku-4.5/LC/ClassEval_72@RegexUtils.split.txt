[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution step by step.

1. The `split` method is called with:
   - pattern: "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b"
   - text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

2. The pattern "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b" matches:
   - \b: word boundary
   - \d{3}: exactly 3 digits
   - -: a literal hyphen
   - \d{3}: exactly 3 digits
   - -: a literal hyphen
   - \d{4}: exactly 4 digits
   - \b: word boundary
   
   This pattern matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX

3. Looking at the text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"
   
   The matches are:
   - "123-456-7890" (matches the pattern)
   - "876-286-9876" (matches the pattern)
   - "987-762-9767" (matches the pattern)

4. re.split() splits the text at these patterns and returns the parts between the matches:
   - Before "123-456-7890": "" (empty string, since it's at the start)
   - Between "123-456-7890" and "876-286-9876": " abiguygusu "
   - Between "876-286-9876" and "987-762-9767": " kjgufwycs "
   - After "987-762-9767": "" (empty string, since it's at the end)

5. The result is: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]
