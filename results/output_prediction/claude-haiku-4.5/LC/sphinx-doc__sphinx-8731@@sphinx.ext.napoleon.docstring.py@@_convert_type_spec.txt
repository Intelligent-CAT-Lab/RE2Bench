[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_convert_type_spec` with the given inputs.

The function is called with:
- `_type` = "str"
- `translations` = {}

Step by step execution:
1. First condition: `if _type in translations:`
   - Check if "str" is in {} (empty dictionary)
   - This is False, so we don't return here

2. Second condition: `elif _type == 'None':`
   - Check if "str" == 'None'
   - This is False, so we don't return here

3. Third condition: `else:`
   - This branch executes
   - Return ':class:`%s`' % _type
   - Which means: ':class:`%s`' % "str"
   - This evaluates to: ':class:`str`'

4. The final `return _type` statement is unreachable because we've already returned in the else block.

So the function returns ':class:`str`'

```
{
    "output": ":class:`str`"
