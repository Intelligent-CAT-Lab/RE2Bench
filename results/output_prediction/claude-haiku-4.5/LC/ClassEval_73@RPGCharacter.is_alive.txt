[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `is_alive` method:

1. The method `is_alive(self)` is called on an RPGCharacter instance
2. The instance has the following attributes:
   - name: "John"
   - hp: 100
   - attack_power: 20
   - defense: 10
   - level: 1
   - exp: 0

3. The method checks: `return self.hp > 0`
4. self.hp = 100
5. 100 > 0 evaluates to True
6. The method returns True
