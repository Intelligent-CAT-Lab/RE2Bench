[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_cmp_name` with the given inputs:

1. We have x = `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>` and y = `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>`

2. Extract the names:
   - n1 = x.__name__ = "ImaginaryUnit"
   - n2 = y.__name__ = "Pi"

3. Check if n1 == n2:
   - "ImaginaryUnit" == "Pi"? No, so we continue.

4. Check if y is a subclass of Basic:
   - Pi is indeed a subclass of Basic from sympy, so we continue.

5. Define UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1
   - ordering_of_classes is a predefined list in sympy that contains the standard ordering of classes. Without knowing the exact contents, I need to check the logic.

6. Try to find i1 (index of "ImaginaryUnit" in ordering_of_classes):
   - "ImaginaryUnit" is likely in the ordering_of_classes list. In sympy's standard ordering, ImaginaryUnit typically appears early in the ordering.
   - Let's assume it has an index i1.

7. Try to find i2 (index of "Pi" in ordering_of_classes):
   - "Pi" is likely in the ordering_of_classes list as well. Pi typically appears in the ordering.
   - Let's assume it has an index i2.

8. In sympy's typical ordering_of_classes, both ImaginaryUnit and Pi are well-known constants that should be in the list. 

Looking at the standard sympy ordering_of_classes, ImaginaryUnit typically comes before Pi in the ordering. So if i1 < i2, then:
   - (i1 > i2) - (i1 < i2) = (False) - (True) = 0 - 1 = -1

However, let me reconsider. In the typical sympy ordering, looking at common orderings:
- ImaginaryUnit (I) and Pi are both constants
- The ordering typically has: NumberSymbol and related constants in a specific order

Without access to the exact ordering_of_classes list, I need to make an educated guess based on typical sympy implementations. Generally, ImaginaryUnit appears earlier than Pi in symbolic ordering.

If i1 < i2 (ImaginaryUnit index < Pi index):
- (i1 > i2) evaluates to False (0)
- (i1 < i2) evaluates to True (1)
- Result: 0 - 1 = -1

So the output should be -1, indicating that x should come before y in the ordering.
