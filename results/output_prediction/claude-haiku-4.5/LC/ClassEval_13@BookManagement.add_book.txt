[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a BookManagement instance with inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}
2. add_book is called with title="book2" and quantity=1 (default)
3. The function checks if "book2" is in self.inventory
4. "book2" IS in self.inventory (it has value 1)
5. So we execute: self.inventory["book2"] += quantity
6. This means: self.inventory["book2"] = 1 + 1 = 2
7. The function modifies the inventory in place but returns None (no explicit return statement)
8. After execution, self.inventory becomes {"book1": 2, "book2": 2}

The function add_book does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns None.
