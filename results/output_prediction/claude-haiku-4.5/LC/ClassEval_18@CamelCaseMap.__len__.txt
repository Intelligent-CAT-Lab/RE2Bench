[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `__len__` method is called on an instance of `CamelCaseMap`.
2. The `self._data` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
3. The `__len__` method returns `len(self._data)`.
4. `len({})` returns `0` since the dictionary is empty.

Therefore, `__len__()` will return `0`.
