[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function `f` step by step with the input array `[]` (an empty list).

1. First while loop: `while -1 in array:`
   - Check if `-1` is in the array `[]`
   - `-1` is not in an empty list, so this condition is `False`
   - The loop doesn't execute

2. Second while loop: `while 0 in array:`
   - Check if `0` is in the array `[]`
   - `0` is not in an empty list, so this condition is `False`
   - The loop doesn't execute

3. Third while loop: `while 1 in array:`
   - Check if `1` is in the array `[]`
   - `1` is not in an empty list, so this condition is `False`
   - The loop doesn't execute

4. Return the array
   - The array remains `[]` since none of the loops executed

So the function returns an empty list `[]`.
