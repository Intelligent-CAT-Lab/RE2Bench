[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `x = int(input())` reads the input string "1" and converts it to an integer. So `x = 1`.
2. The code then checks `if x == 1:`. Since `x` is indeed equal to 1, this condition is True.
3. Since the condition is True, the code executes `print(0)`, which outputs `0`.
4. The `else` branch is not executed.

So the output will be `0`.
