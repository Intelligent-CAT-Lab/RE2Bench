[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `setup` function:

1. The function `setup` takes one parameter: `app` which is of type `Sphinx`
2. Inside the function:
   - `app.add_post_transform(ImageDownloader)` is called - this registers ImageDownloader as a post-transform
   - `app.add_post_transform(DataURIExtractor)` is called - this registers DataURIExtractor as a post-transform
   - Both of these calls modify the app's registry but don't return anything that affects the function's output
3. The function returns a dictionary with three key-value pairs:
   - `'version': 'builtin'`
   - `'parallel_read_safe': True`
   - `'parallel_write_safe': True`

The return type is `ExtensionMetadata` which is a TypedDict containing these three fields. The function constructs and returns this dictionary directly without any conditional logic based on the input.

So the output will be the dictionary with:
- version = 'builtin'
- parallel_read_safe = True
- parallel_write_safe = True
</THOUGHT>

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
```
