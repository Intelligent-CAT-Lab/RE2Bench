[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `N = int(input())` reads the input string "99" and converts it to an integer. So N = 99.

2. The code checks `if N % 2 == 0:` - this checks if N is even.
   - 99 % 2 = 1 (since 99 is odd), so the condition is False.

3. Since the condition is False, we execute the else branch:
   `print((N + 1) / N / 2)`

4. Let's calculate (N + 1) / N / 2:
   - N + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100
   - (N + 1) / N = 100 / 99 = 1.0101010101...
   - (N + 1) / N / 2 = 1.0101010101... / 2 = 0.5050505050...

5. In Python 3, division with `/` returns a float. So the result will be approximately 0.5050505050505051 (with floating point precision).

6. When printed, Python will display this as: 0.5050505050505051
