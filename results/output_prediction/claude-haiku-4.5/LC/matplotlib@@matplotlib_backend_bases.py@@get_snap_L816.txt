[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `get_snap` method:

1. The method `get_snap` is called on a `GraphicsContextBase` instance
2. Looking at the method definition:
```python
def get_snap(self):
    return self._snap
```
3. The method simply returns `self._snap`
4. From the input, I can see that `self._snap` is set to `null` (which is `None` in Python)
5. Therefore, `get_snap()` will return `None`
