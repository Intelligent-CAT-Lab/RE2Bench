[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. __init__(file_name="") stores self.file_name = ""
2. extract_all(output_path="") is called
3. The method tries to execute:
   ```
   with zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r') as zip_file:
       zip_file.extractall(output_path)
   ```
4. zipfile.ZipFile("", 'r') attempts to open an empty string as a file path
5. Since "" is not a valid file path, this will raise an exception (FileNotFoundError or similar)
6. The exception is caught by the bare `except:` clause
7. The function returns False

So the output will be False.
