[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this execution step by step.

1. We have a `DomainMatrix` object with:
   - `rep`: appears to be an SDM (Sparse Domain Matrix) based on the structure
   - `shape`: [2, 2]
   - `domain`: "EXRAW"

2. The `to_list()` method is called on the `DomainMatrix` object, which delegates to `self.rep.to_list()`

3. Looking at the `rep` structure:
   - It's a dictionary with string keys "0" and "1" (rows)
   - Each row contains another dictionary with string keys "0" and "1" (columns)
   - The values are Matrix objects

4. Since this is being treated as an SDM (sparse domain matrix), the `SDM.to_list()` function would be used.

5. The SDM.to_list() function:
   - Takes shape (2, 2) and the sparse dictionary representation
   - Creates a dense matrix initialized with zeros: `ddm = [[zero] * 2 for _ in range(2)]`
   - For each row i in M.items() (the sparse dict)
   - For each column j and element e in row.items()
   - Sets ddm[i][j] = e

6. Processing the sparse dictionary:
   - Row 0: {0: Matrix([...]), 1: Matrix([...])}
   - Row 1: {0: Matrix([...]), 1: Matrix([...])}

7. The resulting list would be:
   - ddm[0][0] = Matrix([\n[1, 0],\n[0, 1]])
   - ddm[0][1] = Matrix([\n[1, 2, 3],\n[3, 5, 4]])
   - ddm[1][0] = Matrix([\n[4, 2],\n[2, 3],\n[7, 5]])
   - ddm[1][1] = Matrix([\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1]])

So the output would be a 2x2 list of Matrix objects:
[[Matrix([...]), Matrix([...])], [Matrix([...]), Matrix([...])]]
