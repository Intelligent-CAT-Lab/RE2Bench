[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `use_required_attribute` method on the `FileInput` class.

1. The method is called with `self` being a FileInput instance and `initial` being `null` (None in Python).

2. The method implementation is:
```python
def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
    return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and (not initial)
```

3. This calls the parent class's `use_required_attribute` method. Since `FileInput` inherits from `Input`, I need to know what the parent's implementation returns. However, the parent class `Input` is not provided in the code snippet.

4. Looking at Django's standard implementation (since this is Django code), the parent `Input.use_required_attribute()` typically returns `True` by default (or calls further up the inheritance chain).

5. However, without the parent class implementation being shown, I need to reason about what's typical in Django. The `Input` class's `use_required_attribute` method generally returns `True` unless there's a specific reason not to.

6. Assuming the parent returns `True`:
   - `super().use_required_attribute(initial)` returns `True`
   - `not initial` where `initial` is `None` (null) evaluates to `True`
   - `True and True` = `True`

Therefore, the output should be `True`.
