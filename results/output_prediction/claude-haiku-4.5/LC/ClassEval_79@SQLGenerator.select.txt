[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The object has `self.table_name = "table1"`
2. `select()` is called with:
   - `fields=None` (default, since not provided in kwargs)
   - `condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"` (from kwargs)

3. Since `fields is None`, we set `fields = '*'`
4. We construct the base SQL: `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
   - This becomes: `sql = f'SELECT * FROM table1'` = `'SELECT * FROM table1'`

5. Since `condition is not None` (it's `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`), we append the WHERE clause:
   - `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
   - This becomes: `sql = 'SELECT * FROM table1' + ' WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'` = `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20'`

6. Finally, we return `sql + ';'` which adds a semicolon at the end:
   - Result: `'SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;'`
</THOUGHT>

```
{
    "output": "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
