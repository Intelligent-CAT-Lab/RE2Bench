[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input: `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`

2. First, `set(lst)` converts the list to a set, removing any duplicates (though there are none here): `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

3. `sorted(set(lst))` sorts the set in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

4. The result is assigned to `lst`, so now `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

5. Next, we check `len(lst) < 2`:
   - `len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` is 5
   - 5 < 2 is False

6. Since the condition is False, we don't return None. Instead, we return `lst[1]`

7. `lst[1]` is the second element (index 1) of the sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `2`

8. The function returns `2`
