[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

1. The function `is_bored(S)` is called with `S = "bIt"`
2. `re.split('[.?!]\\s*', S)` splits the string S by the pattern `[.?!]\s*`, which means "a period, question mark, or exclamation mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters"
3. In the string "bIt", there are no periods, question marks, or exclamation marks, so the split will return the entire string as a single element in a list: `["bIt"]`
4. Now we iterate through this list of sentences with a generator expression: `(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)`
5. For the sentence "bIt":
   - `sentence[0:2]` extracts the first 2 characters: "bI"
   - We check if `"bI" == 'I '`
   - This is False because "bI" is not equal to "I " (the string "I" followed by a space)
6. `sum()` counts the number of True values in the generator expression
7. Since we have one False value, the sum is 0

The function returns 0.
