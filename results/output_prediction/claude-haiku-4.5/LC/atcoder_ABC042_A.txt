[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. `input()` reads the string "7 5 5"
2. `.split()` splits the string by whitespace, resulting in ['7', '5', '5']
3. `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer, resulting in [7, 5, 5]
4. `tuple(...)` converts the list to a tuple, so `ABC = (7, 5, 5)`
5. `ABC.count(5)` counts how many times the value 5 appears in the tuple. In (7, 5, 5), the value 5 appears 2 times, so `ABC.count(5) == 2` evaluates to `True`
6. Since the condition is True, we enter the if block
7. Inside the if block: `sum(ABC)` calculates the sum of all elements: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17
8. The condition `sum(ABC) == 17` evaluates to `17 == 17`, which is `True`
9. Since the inner condition is True, it prints 'YES'
