[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. We have an XMLProcessor instance with:
   - self.file_name = ""
   - self.root = null (None in Python)

2. write_xml is called with file_name = ""

3. Inside write_xml:
   - tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root) is called with self.root = None
   - ET.ElementTree(None) will create an ElementTree with root = None
   - tree.write(file_name) is called with file_name = ""
   - This attempts to write to an empty filename ""

4. The write method will fail because:
   - You cannot write to a file with an empty filename
   - Also, writing an ElementTree with root=None would be problematic
   - This will raise an exception

5. The exception is caught by the try-except block:
   ```python
   except:
       return False
   ```

6. Since an exception occurs, the function returns False
