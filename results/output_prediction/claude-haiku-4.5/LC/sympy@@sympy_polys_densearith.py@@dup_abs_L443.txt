[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `dup_abs`:

1. The function `dup_abs` takes two parameters:
   - `f`: [2] (a list with one element)
   - `K`: "ZZ" (representing the integer domain)

2. The function executes a list comprehension:
   ```python
   return [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]
   ```

3. Iterating through `f = [2]`:
   - For coeff = 2:
     - K.abs(2) is called, which applies the absolute value function from the ZZ (integer) domain
     - Since 2 is already positive, abs(2) = 2

4. The list comprehension returns [2]

So the output is a list containing the absolute values of all coefficients in f.
