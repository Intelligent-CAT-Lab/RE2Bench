[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with `nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`
2. `count = len(nums)` → `count = 5`
3. The for loop iterates: `for num in range(2, count)` → `for num in range(2, 5)` → this means num will take values 2, 3, 4 (three iterations)
4. Inside the loop, `nums.sort()` is called each iteration:
   - First iteration (num=2): `nums.sort()` → nums becomes `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` (already sorted)
   - Second iteration (num=3): `nums.sort()` → nums becomes `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` (already sorted)
   - Third iteration (num=4): `nums.sort()` → nums becomes `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` (already sorted)
5. After the loop completes, the function returns `nums`
6. The returned value is `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`

Note: The loop doesn't actually modify the list differently on each iteration since `.sort()` sorts the list in-place. The input list is already sorted, so each call to `.sort()` results in the same sorted list.
