[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `greatest_common_divisor` function with inputs a=10 and b=15.

This function implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).

Initial state: a = 10, b = 15

Iteration 1:
- Condition: `while b:` checks if b is non-zero. b = 15 (truthy), so enter the loop
- Execute: `a, b = (b, a % b)`
  - b = 15
  - a % b = 10 % 15 = 10
  - So: a = 15, b = 10

Iteration 2:
- Condition: `while b:` checks if b is non-zero. b = 10 (truthy), so continue the loop
- Execute: `a, b = (b, a % b)`
  - b = 10
  - a % b = 15 % 10 = 5
  - So: a = 10, b = 5

Iteration 3:
- Condition: `while b:` checks if b is non-zero. b = 5 (truthy), so continue the loop
- Execute: `a, b = (b, a % b)`
  - b = 5
  - a % b = 10 % 5 = 0
  - So: a = 5, b = 0

Iteration 4:
- Condition: `while b:` checks if b is non-zero. b = 0 (falsy), so exit the loop

Return: a = 5

The greatest common divisor of 10 and 15 is 5.
