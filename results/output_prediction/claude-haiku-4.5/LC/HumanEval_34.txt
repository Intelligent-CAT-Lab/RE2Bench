[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input.
2. Input list `l` is: [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
3. First, `set(l)` converts the list to a set, which removes all duplicates. The set will contain: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}
4. Then, `list(set(l))` converts the set back to a list. The order of elements in a set is not guaranteed, but when converted to a list it could be something like [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123] (or another order).
5. Finally, `sorted(...)` sorts the list in ascending order, which will give us: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
6. The function returns this sorted list.
