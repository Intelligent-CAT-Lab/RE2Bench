[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads the input "80 970" and splits it.
   - a = 80
   - b = 970

2. `x = a` → x = 80
3. `h = 0` → h = 0
4. `s = 0` → s = 0

5. First while loop: `while x > 0:`
   - This loop runs while x > 0, and in each iteration: x -= 1, h += 1, s += 1
   - This loop will run 80 times (from x=80 down to x=1)
   - After the loop: x = 0, h = 80, s = 80

6. Second while loop: `while s // b != 0:`
   - This checks if s // b (integer division) is not equal to 0
   - Initially: s = 80, b = 970
   - s // b = 80 // 970 = 0 (since 80 < 970)
   - The condition `s // b != 0` evaluates to `0 != 0` which is False
   - So this while loop doesn't execute at all

7. `print(h)` prints the value of h, which is 80
