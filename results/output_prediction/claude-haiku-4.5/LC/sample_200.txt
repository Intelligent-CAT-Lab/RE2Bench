[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this function step by step.

Given:
- text = "jao mt"
- value = "house"

Initial state:
- length = len("jao mt") = 6
- index = 0
- value = "house"

Now let's execute the while loop:

Iteration 1: length = 6 (> 0)
- value = text[0] + value = "j" + "house" = "jhouse"
- length = 6 - 1 = 5
- index = 0 + 1 = 1

Iteration 2: length = 5 (> 0)
- value = text[1] + value = "a" + "jhouse" = "ajhouse"
- length = 5 - 1 = 4
- index = 1 + 1 = 2

Iteration 3: length = 4 (> 0)
- value = text[2] + value = "o" + "ajhouse" = "oajhouse"
- length = 4 - 1 = 3
- index = 2 + 1 = 3

Iteration 4: length = 3 (> 0)
- value = text[3] + value = " " + "oajhouse" = " oajhouse"
- length = 3 - 1 = 2
- index = 3 + 1 = 4

Iteration 5: length = 2 (> 0)
- value = text[4] + value = "m" + " oajhouse" = "m oajhouse"
- length = 2 - 1 = 1
- index = 4 + 1 = 5

Iteration 6: length = 1 (> 0)
- value = text[5] + value = "t" + "m oajhouse" = "tm oajhouse"
- length = 1 - 1 = 0
- index = 5 + 1 = 6

Now length = 0, so the while loop exits.

The function returns value = "tm oajhouse"

This function is essentially reversing the string and prepending it to the initial value.
"jao mt" reversed is "tm oaj" and prepending to "house" gives... wait, let me reconsider.

Actually, looking at the logic again - it's prepending each character of text to value one at a time from the beginning. So it's building up the reverse of the string and prepending it to the original value.

The characters of "jao mt" are prepended in order: j, a, o, (space), m, t
When prepended in order to "house", we get: "tm oajhouse"

So the output is "tm oajhouse"
