[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We're calling `get_gpa("Charlie")`
2. The method checks if "Charlie" is in self.students and if self.students["Charlie"]['courses'] is not empty.
3. "Charlie" is indeed in self.students.
4. self.students["Charlie"]['courses'] = {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}, which is not empty (truthy).
5. Since both conditions are true, we proceed to calculate the GPA:
   - sum(self.students["Charlie"]['courses'].values()) = sum([70, 80]) = 150
   - len(self.students["Charlie"]['courses']) = 2
   - GPA = 150 / 2 = 75.0
6. Return 75.0

```
{
    "output": 75.0
}
