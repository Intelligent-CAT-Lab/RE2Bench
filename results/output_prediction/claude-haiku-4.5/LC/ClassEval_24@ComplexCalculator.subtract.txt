[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `subtract` method is a staticmethod that takes two complex numbers c1 and c2.
2. The input provides c1 as the string "(-1+2j)" and c2 as the string "(-3+4j)".
3. In Python, when you access .real and .imag on a string, this will cause an AttributeError because strings don't have these attributes.

Wait, let me reconsider. The input shows strings, but in actual Python execution, these would need to be converted to complex numbers first. However, looking at the function signature, it directly accesses c1.real and c2.real without any conversion.

If the strings are passed as-is:
- "(-1+2j)".real would fail with AttributeError

However, if we interpret the input as Python is evaluating the string literals to complex objects (which is what would happen if they were actually passed as complex literals in code), then:
- c1 = complex(-1, 2) = (-1+2j)
- c2 = complex(-3, 4) = (-3+4j)

Then:
- real = c1.real - c2.real = -1 - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2
- imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag = 2 - 4 = -2
- result = complex(2, -2) = (2-2j)

Given the context of the problem where we're meant to predict output, I believe the strings should be interpreted as their complex number values (as they would be if written as literals in Python code).

So the output should be (2-2j).
