[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `construct_stop_word_list`:

1. The method is called with no arguments (besides self).
2. Inside the method, a list is created: `stop_word_list = ['a', 'an', 'the']`
3. The method returns this list.
4. Therefore, the output will be the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["a", "an", "the"]
}
```
