[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

1. `num = input().split('.')` - The input is "2.4", so after splitting by '.', num becomes `['2', '4']`

2. First condition: `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
   - `num[0]` is '2'
   - `num[0][-1]` is the last character of '2', which is '2'
   - `int('2')` is 2
   - `2 == 9` is False, so this condition is not met

3. Second condition: `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
   - `num[1]` is '4'
   - `num[1][0]` is the first character of '4', which is '4'
   - `int('4')` is 4
   - `4 >= 5` is False, so this condition is not met

4. Since both conditions are False, we go to the else branch:
   - `print(num[0])` prints the first element of the split, which is '2'
