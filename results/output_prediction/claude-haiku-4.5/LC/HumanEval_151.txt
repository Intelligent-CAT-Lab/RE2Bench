[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of squares of elements that meet certain conditions.

The input provided is:
- `lst`: [] (an empty list)

The function executes:
```python
return sum([i ** 2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and ('.' not in str(i))])
```

This is a list comprehension that:
1. Iterates through each element `i` in `lst`
2. Checks if `i > 0` (positive)
3. Checks if `i % 2 != 0` (odd number)
4. Checks if `'.' not in str(i)` (no decimal point in string representation)
5. If all conditions are met, includes `i ** 2` in the list

Since `lst` is an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over. The list comprehension will produce an empty list `[]`.

`sum([])` returns `0` (the sum of an empty list is 0).

Therefore, the output is `0`.
