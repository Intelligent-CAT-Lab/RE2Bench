[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `math_to_image` with the given inputs:

1. **Input parameters:**
   - s = "$x^2$"
   - filename_or_obj = PosixPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/example.png')
   - prop = None
   - dpi = None
   - format = None
   - color = None

2. **Step 1: Create MathTextParser**
   ```python
   parser = MathTextParser('path')
   ```
   This creates a parser with output_type = 'vector' (since 'path' maps to 'vector' in the `__init__` method).

3. **Step 2: Parse the math expression**
   ```python
   width, height, depth, _, _ = parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)
   ```
   The `parse` method is called with:
   - s = "$x^2$"
   - dpi = 72
   - prop = None
   - antialiased will be determined from rc params
   
   The parse method returns a VectorParse (since output_type is 'vector'). This will return (width, height, depth, _, _) - the actual numerical values depend on the math text parsing, but these would be float values representing the dimensions in pixels at 72 DPI.
   
   For the purpose of this exercise, the parse method returns some numerical values. Let's denote them as width, height, depth (which would be floats).

4. **Step 3: Create a figure**
   ```python
   fig = figure.Figure(figsize=(width / 72.0, height / 72.0))
   ```
   A Figure object is created with figsize calculated from the parsed dimensions.

5. **Step 4: Add text to the figure**
   ```python
   fig.text(0, depth / height, s, fontproperties=prop, color=color)
   ```
   This adds the text "$x^2$" to the figure at position (0, depth/height) with color=None.
   The `text` method returns a Text object, but the return value is not used.

6. **Step 5: Save the figure**
   ```python
   fig.savefig(filename_or_obj, dpi=dpi, format=format)
   ```
   The figure is saved to the file. Since dpi=None and format=None, these will use defaults.

7. **Step 6: Return depth**
   ```python
   return depth
   ```
   The function returns the `depth` value that was obtained from the parser.parse() call.

The key point is: **what is the value of `depth`?**

Since the parser.parse() method is called with a math expression "$x^2$", it will parse this and return dimensions. The `depth` is typically the depth of the rendered text (distance below the baseline).

For a typical mathematical expression like "$x^2$", the depth would be a small value (the baseline is often at 0 and depth represents how far below the baseline the text extends). For "$x^2$", since the superscript is above, the depth should be minimal.

However, without executing the actual matplotlib code, I cannot know the exact numerical value. But the function will return a float value representing the depth in pixels at 72 DPI.

Looking at the structure, the output should be a numeric value representing depth. Since I cannot execute the actual matplotlib parsing, I need to consider what a reasonable return value would be.

For a simple expression like "$x^2$" at 72 DPI, the depth would typically be a small positive float, possibly around 0-5 pixels. However, the exact value depends on the font metrics.

Given that this is a prediction task and I cannot execute the actual matplotlib code, a reasonable assumption is that the depth would be something like `0.0` to a small positive number. For a superscript expression, the depth is often 0 or very small.

A typical value might be `0` or a small float. Let me assume a common scenario where the depth is `0.0` (since superscripts don't go below the baseline).

Actually, looking more carefully at the problem - the return type should just be the numeric value. Based on typical matplotlib behavior for parsing math text like "$x^2$", the depth is often 0 or close to 0 since the superscript doesn't extend below the baseline.

I'll estimate the return value as `0.0` or possibly a small positive float. Without running the code, a reasonable guess is `0.0`.
