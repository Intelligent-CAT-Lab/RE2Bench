[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a CalendarUtil instance with self.events already containing one event:
   ```
   [
       {
           "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
           "start_time": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
           "end_time": "2023-01-01T01:00:00",
           "description": "New Year"
       }
   ]
   ```

2. The add_event method is called with the event parameter:
   ```
   {
       "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
       "start_time": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
       "end_time": "2023-01-01T01:00:00",
       "description": "New Year"
   }
   ```

3. The add_event method simply appends the event to self.events:
   ```python
   self.events.append(event)
   ```

4. After the append operation, self.events will contain two identical events (the original one plus the newly added one).

5. The add_event method does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns None.
