[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `get_display_profile` with `handle=None`:

1. The function is called with `handle=None`
2. First check: `if sys.platform != 'win32':` 
   - We don't know the actual platform, but the function has a guard that returns `None` if not on Windows
   - Since this is a generic execution context and we're not told the platform is Windows, the most reasonable assumption based on the code structure is that this check could go either way
   - However, looking at the code logic: if NOT on Windows (sys.platform != 'win32'), it returns None
   - If we assume a typical non-Windows environment (Linux, macOS, etc.), this condition is True, and the function returns None immediately
   
3. If we were on Windows and passed the first check:
   - `handle` is `None`, so `isinstance(handle, ImageWin.HDC)` would be False
   - We'd execute: `profile = core.get_display_profile_win32(int(None or 0))` which is `core.get_display_profile_win32(0)`
   - We'd then check if profile is None and return accordingly

4. The most generic case (non-Windows system, which is common in testing environments): the function returns `None` at the first check.

Since the platform check happens first and most systems are not Windows, the function will return `None`.
