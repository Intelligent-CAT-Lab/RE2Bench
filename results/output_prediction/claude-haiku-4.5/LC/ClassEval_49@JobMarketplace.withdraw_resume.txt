[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The JobMarketplace object is initialized with:
   - job_listings: [{"job_title": "Software Engineer", "company": "ABC Company", "requirements": ["skill1", "skill2"]}]
   - resumes: []

2. The `withdraw_resume` method is called with:
   - resume: {"name": "Tom", "skills": ["skill1", "skill2"], "experience": "experience"}

3. The method executes: `self.resumes.remove(resume)`
   - It attempts to remove the resume object from self.resumes
   - However, self.resumes is currently an empty list []
   - The resume object is not in the list
   - Calling `remove()` on a list with an item that doesn't exist raises a ValueError

4. This will raise an exception: `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list`

The function will not return normally; it will raise an exception instead.
