[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. data = [1, 1, 1]
2. n = len(data) = 3
3. mean = sum(data) / n = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.0
4. variance = sum(((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data)) / n
   - For x = 1: (1 - 1)^2 = 0
   - For x = 1: (1 - 1)^2 = 0
   - For x = 1: (1 - 1)^2 = 0
   - sum = 0
   - variance = 0 / 3 = 0.0
5. std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance) = math.sqrt(0.0) = 0.0
6. Since std_deviation == 0, the condition `if std_deviation != 0` is False
7. Therefore, skewness = 0
8. Return 0

The function returns 0 because when all data points are identical, the standard deviation is 0, which triggers the conditional that returns 0 to avoid division by zero in the skewness formula.
