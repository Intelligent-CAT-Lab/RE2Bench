[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `total` method step by step.

1. The `total` method is called on an instance of `DiscountStrategy`.
2. The instance has a `cart` attribute containing a list of items:
   - Item 1: quantity=10, price=20.0
   - Item 2: quantity=5, price=10.0

3. The method calculates: `sum((item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.cart))`

4. For item 1: 10 * 20.0 = 200.0
5. For item 2: 5 * 10.0 = 50.0

6. Sum: 200.0 + 50.0 = 250.0

7. The method sets `self.__total = 250.0` and returns 250.0
