[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `get_n_splits` method:

1. The method signature is: `def get_n_splits(self, X=None, y=None, groups=None):`

2. Looking at the input:
   - `self.n_splits` = 3
   - `self.shuffle` = false
   - `self.random_state` = null
   - X, y, and groups are provided but the method doesn't use them

3. The method body is simply:
   ```python
   return self.n_splits
   ```

4. Since `self.n_splits` = 3, the method will return 3.

The method completely ignores the X, y, and groups parameters and just returns the stored `n_splits` value.

{
    "output": 3
