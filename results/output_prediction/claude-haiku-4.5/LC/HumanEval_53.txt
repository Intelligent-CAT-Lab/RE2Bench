[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `add` takes two parameters: `x` and `y`, both of type `int`.
2. From the input, we have `x = 852` and `y = 371`.
3. The function performs a simple addition: `x + y = 852 + 371`.
4. Let me calculate: 852 + 371 = 1223
5. The function returns the result of this addition.

So the output should be 1223.
