[THOUGHT]
Let's execute this code step by step.

1. `n = int(input())` reads the input "8", so `n = 8`
2. `i, j = (1, n * n)` initializes `i = 1` and `j = 8 * 8 = 64`
3. Now we enter the while loop with condition `while i < j:`

Loop iterations:
- Iteration 1: i=1, j=64. Condition 1 < 64 is True. Print "1 64". Then i becomes 2, j becomes 63.
- Iteration 2: i=2, j=63. Condition 2 < 63 is True. Print "2 63". Then i becomes 3, j becomes 62.
- Iteration 3: i=3, j=62. Condition 3 < 62 is True. Print "3 62". Then i becomes 4, j becomes 61.
- Iteration 4: i=4, j=61. Condition 4 < 61 is True. Print "4 61". Then i becomes 5, j becomes 60.
- Iteration 5: i=5, j=60. Condition 5 < 60 is True. Print "5 60". Then i becomes 6, j becomes 59.
- Iteration 6: i=6, j=59. Condition 6 < 59 is True. Print "6 59". Then i becomes 7, j becomes 58.
- Iteration 7: i=7, j=58. Condition 7 < 58 is True. Print "7 58". Then i becomes 8, j becomes 57.
- Iteration 8: i=8, j=57. Condition 8 < 57 is True. Print "8 57". Then i becomes 9, j becomes 56.
- Iteration 9: i=9, j=56. Condition 9 < 56 is True. Print "9 56". Then i becomes 10, j becomes 55.
- ... (continuing this pattern)
- Iteration 31: i=31, j=34. Condition 31 < 34 is True. Print "31 34". Then i becomes 32, j becomes 33.
- Iteration 32: i=32, j=33. Condition 32 < 33 is True. Print "32 33". Then i becomes 33, j becomes 32.
- Now: i=33, j=32. Condition 33 < 32 is False. Exit loop.

So the output will be all pairs printed from (1, 64) down to (32, 33).
