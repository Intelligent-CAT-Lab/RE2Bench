[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the input array `[1, 2, 1]`.

1. `new_array = array.copy()` creates a shallow copy of the array. So `new_array = [1, 2, 1]`.

2. `new_array = reversed(new_array)` returns a reversed iterator object of the array. The `reversed()` function returns an iterator, not a list. So `new_array` is now a reversed iterator that will yield elements in reverse order: 1, 2, 1 (from the end to the beginning).

3. `return [x * x for x in new_array]` iterates through the reversed iterator and squares each element:
   - First element from reversed iterator: 1 (the last element of original array) → 1 * 1 = 1
   - Second element from reversed iterator: 2 (the middle element) → 2 * 2 = 4
   - Third element from reversed iterator: 1 (the first element of original array) → 1 * 1 = 1
   
   So the result is `[1, 4, 1]`.
