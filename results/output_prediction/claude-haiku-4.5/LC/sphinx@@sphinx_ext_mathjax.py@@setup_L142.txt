[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `setup` function step by step:

1. The function `setup(app: Sphinx)` is called with a Sphinx application object.

2. The function performs several operations:
   - `app.add_html_math_renderer(...)` - registers a math renderer
   - `app.add_config_value(...)` - called multiple times to register configuration values
   - `app.connect(...)` - connects event handlers

3. All these operations are method calls on the `app` object and don't affect the return value directly.

4. The function returns a dictionary:
   ```python
   return {'version': sphinx.__display_version__, 'parallel_read_safe': True}
   ```

5. The return value is an `ExtensionMetadata` dictionary containing:
   - `'version'`: `sphinx.__display_version__` - this is the display version string of the Sphinx module
   - `'parallel_read_safe'`: `True` - a boolean flag indicating this extension is safe for parallel reading

Looking at the structure, I need to provide values for:
- `version`: This should be `sphinx.__display_version__`. Since we're looking at Sphinx documentation/code, the actual version string would be something like the current Sphinx version (e.g., "7.1.0" or similar). However, the actual value depends on the installed Sphinx version. Based on typical Sphinx usage, this would be a string like the version number.
- `parallel_read_safe`: This is explicitly set to `True` in the return statement.

Since the input doesn't specify which version of Sphinx is being used, I should represent `sphinx.__display_version__` as it would appear - it's a string containing the version. In practice, this might be something like "7.1.0" but without knowing the exact version, I can represent it as the attribute access that would occur.

Actually, looking more carefully, the function literally returns `sphinx.__display_version__`, which is a string attribute of the sphinx module. This would typically be a version string like "7.1.2" or similar.

For the purposes of this exercise, I'll represent it as it would actually be - a version string. Since we don't have the specific version info, I should indicate it's the sphinx version. Let me use a reasonable representation like what Sphinx typically returns.

The `parallel_read_safe` value is clearly `True`.
