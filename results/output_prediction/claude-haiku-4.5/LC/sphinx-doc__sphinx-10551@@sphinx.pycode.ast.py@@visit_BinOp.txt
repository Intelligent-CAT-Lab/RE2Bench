[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `visit_BinOp` step by step.

1. The function receives a node of type `ast.BinOp` with:
   - `node.left`: an ast.Name node with id="int"
   - `node.op`: an empty dict (representing some operator)
   - `node.right`: an ast.Constant node with value=None

2. First, the function checks `if isinstance(node.op, ast.Pow):`
   - The node.op is represented as an empty dict in the input, which suggests it's not an ast.Pow operator
   - So this condition is False, and we skip the first return statement

3. Since the condition is False, we execute the else path (implicitly, as there's no explicit else):
   ```python
   return ' '.join((self.visit(e) for e in [node.left, node.op, node.right]))
   ```

4. This will call `self.visit()` on each of:
   - `node.left`: This is an ast.Name node. The visitor would visit it and return "int"
   - `node.op`: This is an operator node. Based on the input being an empty dict, it appears to be some operator. Without more info, typical operators return their string representation. Looking at the structure, it's likely an ast.BitOr (|) operator based on the code context "int | None"
   - `node.right`: This is an ast.Constant with value=None. The visitor would return "None"

5. The `' '.join()` will join these three results with spaces.

However, I need to be careful. The input shows `"op": {}` which is an empty dict. In actual ast module usage, this would be a specific operator type. Given the context "int | None", this is a BitOr operator (|).

Assuming standard behavior:
- `self.visit(node.left)` returns "int"
- `self.visit(node.op)` returns "|" (or similar representation)
- `self.visit(node.right)` returns "None"

The join with spaces would produce: "int | None"

But without being able to see the actual visit implementation for the op and right nodes, and given that the op is shown as an empty dict, the most reasonable assumption is that it represents a BitOr operator that gets visited as "|".

The output would be: "int | None"
