[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. The input is "3 4 7 8", which will be split and mapped to integers.
   - `anti = 3`
   - `b = 4`
   - `c = 7`
   - `d = 8`

2. Calculate `l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = abs(-4) = 4`

3. Calculate `m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = abs(-4) = 4`

4. Now we go through the conditional statements:
   - Check `if anti == c`: Is `3 == 7`? No, this is False.
   - Check `elif b == d`: Is `4 == 8`? No, this is False.
   - Check `elif l != m`: Is `4 != 4`? No, this is False.
   - So we go to the `else` branch.

5. Execute `print(anti, d, c, b)`:
   - This prints: `3 8 7 4`
