[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `string_sequence` is called with `n = 10`.
2. Inside the function, we have a list comprehension: `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]`
3. `range(n + 1)` means `range(10 + 1)` which is `range(11)`. This generates numbers from 0 to 10 (inclusive).
4. The list comprehension converts each number to a string: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']`
5. `' '.join(...)` joins all these strings together with a space as separator.
6. The result will be: "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
