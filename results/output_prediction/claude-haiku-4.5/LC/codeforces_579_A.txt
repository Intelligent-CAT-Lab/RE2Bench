[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this code step by step.

1. `n = int(input())` reads the input "536870912", so `n = 536870912`
2. `x = 1`
3. We enter a while loop with condition `math.log2(n) % 1`:
   - This condition checks if `math.log2(n)` has a fractional part (i.e., if n is not a power of 2)
   - `math.log2(536870912) = math.log2(2^29) = 29.0`
   - `29.0 % 1 = 0.0`, which is falsy
   - So the while loop condition is False, and we don't enter the loop

4. `print(x)` outputs the value of `x`, which is still `1`

Wait, let me verify that 536870912 is indeed a power of 2:
- 2^29 = 536870912 ✓

Yes, 536870912 = 2^29, so `math.log2(536870912) = 29.0`, and `29.0 % 1 = 0.0` which is falsy.

The while loop doesn't execute because the condition is false from the start.

Therefore, `x` remains 1 and that's what gets printed.
