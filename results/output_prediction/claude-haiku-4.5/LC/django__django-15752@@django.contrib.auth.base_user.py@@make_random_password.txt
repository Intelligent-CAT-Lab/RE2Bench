[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `make_random_password`:

1. The function is called with default arguments:
   - `length=10` (default)
   - `allowed_chars='abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'` (default)

2. A warning is issued with `warnings.warn()` about deprecation, but this doesn't affect the return value.

3. The function returns `get_random_string(length, allowed_chars)`, which is:
   - `get_random_string(10, 'abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789')`

4. `get_random_string()` is a Django utility function that generates a random string of the specified length using characters from the allowed_chars string. Since this is a random function, it will return a different string each time it's called. However, the function will return a string of exactly 10 characters composed of the allowed character set.

5. The output will be a random string of 10 characters. Since we cannot predict the exact random output, but we know it will be a string of length 10 composed of alphanumeric characters (excluding 'i', 'l', 'o', '0', '1' for readability).

Given that this is a random function and we need to predict the output, the most accurate representation is that it returns a random string. However, since the actual random value cannot be predicted deterministically without executing the code, I should indicate this is a random string of length 10 from the specified character set.

For the purposes of this exercise, I'll represent the output as a string, understanding that the exact value would be random in real execution.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "RANDOM_STRING_OF_LENGTH_10"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Note: The `get_random_string()` function generates a random string, so the exact output cannot be deterministically predicted. The output will be a 10-character string composed of characters from the set 'abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'.
