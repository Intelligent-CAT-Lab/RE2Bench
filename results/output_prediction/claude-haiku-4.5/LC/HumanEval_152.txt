[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the `compare` function step by step.

The function takes two parameters: `game` and `guess`.
- `game = [1, 2, 3, 5]`
- `guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]`

The function returns a list comprehension: `[abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]`

Let me trace through the `zip(game, guess)` which pairs up elements from both lists:
- (1, -1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 3)
- (5, 4)

Now I calculate `abs(x - y)` for each pair:
- abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(1 + 1) = abs(2) = 2
- abs(2 - 2) = abs(0) = 0
- abs(3 - 3) = abs(0) = 0
- abs(5 - 4) = abs(1) = 1

So the result is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`
