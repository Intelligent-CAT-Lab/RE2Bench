[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

The function `any_int` takes three parameters: x, y, z.

Given inputs:
- x = 2
- y = 1
- z = 1

Step 1: Check if all three parameters are integers using `isinstance()`
- `isinstance(2, int)` → True
- `isinstance(1, int)` → True
- `isinstance(1, int)` → True
- So the condition `isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)` evaluates to True

Step 2: Since the first condition is True, we enter the if block and check the second condition:
`if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x:`

Let's evaluate each part:
- `x + y == z`: 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
- `x + z == y`: 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
- `y + z == x`: 1 + 1 == 2 → 2 == 2 → True

Since at least one of the conditions is True (specifically `y + z == x` is True), the overall condition evaluates to True.

Step 3: Since the condition is True, the function returns `True`
