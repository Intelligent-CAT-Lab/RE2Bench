[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `__pow__` method step by step:

1. The method is called with `self` being a Permutation object and `n = -2`
2. First, it checks `if isinstance(n, Permutation)`: Since `n = -2` (an integer), this is False, so we skip the NotImplementedError
3. Next, `n = int(n)`: This converts n to an integer. Since n is already -2 (an integer), `int(-2)` returns -2
4. Then it returns `self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n))`
5. We need to call `_af_pow(self.array_form, -2)`

However, looking at the input, `self._array_form` is `null` (None). 

The problem is that we don't have the implementation of `_af_pow` function provided. We only have the `__int__` method from `sympy.core.numbers.Integer`, which is not directly relevant here.

Since `_af_new` is assigned to `Perm._af_new` which is `Permutation._af_new` (a classmethod that creates a new Permutation from array form), and we're calling `_af_pow(self.array_form, -2)`:

Without the actual implementation of `_af_pow`, I cannot determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the code:
- `_af_pow` is likely a function that computes the array form of a permutation raised to power n
- It would take the array_form and the exponent
- It would return an array form
- Then `_af_new` would wrap that into a new Permutation object

Since the input shows `_array_form` is null and we don't have implementations of `_af_pow` or details about what happens with a null array_form, I cannot definitively compute this without making assumptions about the missing code.

However, if I must provide an answer based on what's given: the function would likely attempt to compute the permutation to the power of -2, and return a new Permutation object with its own `_array_form` and `_size`.

Without the `_af_pow` function implementation, I cannot accurately predict the specific values. The output would be a Permutation object with computed `_array_form` and `_size` values.

Given the constraints and missing implementations, I'll note that the exact result depends on `_af_pow` which is not provided.
