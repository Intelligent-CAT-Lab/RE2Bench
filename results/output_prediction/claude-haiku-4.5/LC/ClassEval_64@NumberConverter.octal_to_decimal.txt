Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `octal_to_decimal` is a static method that takes an octal number as a string.
2. Input: octal_num = "51427"
3. The function calls `int(octal_num, 8)` which converts the octal string to a decimal integer.
4. Let me calculate: "51427" in octal to decimal:
   - 5 × 8^4 = 5 × 4096 = 20480
   - 1 × 8^3 = 1 × 512 = 512
   - 4 × 8^2 = 4 × 64 = 256
   - 2 × 8^1 = 2 × 8 = 16
   - 7 × 8^0 = 7 × 1 = 7
   - Total: 20480 + 512 + 256 + 16 + 7 = 21271
5. The function returns this decimal value: 21271
