[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `sort_array` is called with `array = [5]`
2. First, we check if `len(array) == 0`:
   - `len([5]) = 1`, which is not 0, so we proceed to the else branch
3. In the else branch, we compute `sorted(array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)`
4. Let's evaluate the `reverse` parameter:
   - `array[0] = 5` (first element)
   - `array[-1] = 5` (last element, which is the same as first since there's only one element)
   - `array[0] + array[-1] = 5 + 5 = 10`
   - `10 % 2 = 0` (10 is even, so remainder is 0)
   - `0 == 0` evaluates to `True`
   - So `reverse=True`
5. Now we call `sorted([5], reverse=True)`
   - Sorting [5] in reverse order still gives [5] (only one element)
6. The function returns `[5]`
