[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a BinaryDataProcessor instance with binary_string = "01101000011011010110001001101111"
2. clean_non_binary_chars() is called
3. The method uses filter with a lambda function to keep only characters that are in '01'
4. The lambda checks: `lambda x: x in '01'`
5. Let's go through the string "01101000011011010110001001101111":
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '0' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep
   - '1' is in '01' → keep

6. Since the entire input string contains only '0' and '1' characters, all characters pass the filter
7. The result is joined back into a string: "01101000011011010110001001101111"
8. This is assigned to self.binary_string
9. The method doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it returns None

The output of the method is None (since it doesn't return anything), but self.binary_string is now "01101000011011010110001001101111" (unchanged since it had no non-binary characters).

Since the method doesn't return anything explicitly, the output is None.
