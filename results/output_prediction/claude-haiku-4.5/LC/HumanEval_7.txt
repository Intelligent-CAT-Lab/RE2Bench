[THOUGHT]
Let me execute this function step by step.

The function `filter_by_substring` takes:
- `strings`: a list of strings ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- `substring`: "run"

The function returns a list comprehension that filters strings where `substring` is contained in each string.

Let me check each string:
1. "grunt" - does "run" appear in "grunt"? No, "grunt" doesn't contain "run"
2. "trumpet" - does "run" appear in "trumpet"? No, "trumpet" doesn't contain "run"
3. "prune" - does "run" appear in "prune"? Yes! "prune" contains "run" (p-**run**-e)
4. "gruesome" - does "run" appear in "gruesome"? No, "gruesome" doesn't contain "run"

So the function will return only ["prune"] since it's the only string that contains the substring "run".
