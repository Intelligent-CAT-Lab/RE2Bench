[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. `__format_line_feed` is a static method that takes `text` as a parameter.
2. The input text is: "Some sentence here."
3. The method calls `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)`
   - `re.compile('\\n+')` creates a regex pattern that matches one or more newline characters
   - `re.sub()` replaces all matches of this pattern with a single '\n'
4. Since the input text "Some sentence here." contains no newline characters at all, the regex pattern won't match anything.
5. Therefore, `re.sub()` will return the text unchanged: "Some sentence here."

The output should be the same as the input text.

    "output": "Some sentence here."
