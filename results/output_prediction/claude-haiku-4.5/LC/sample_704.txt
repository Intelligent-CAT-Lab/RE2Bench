[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function step by step.

Given inputs:
- s = "."
- n = 0
- c = "99"

1. First, calculate `width = len(c) * n`
   - len(c) = len("99") = 2
   - width = 2 * 0 = 0

2. The for loop iterates `width - len(s)` times:
   - width - len(s) = 0 - len(".") = 0 - 1 = -1
   - `range(-1)` produces an empty range (no iterations since the range is negative)
   
3. Since the loop doesn't execute (range is empty), s remains unchanged: s = "."

4. Return s = "."
