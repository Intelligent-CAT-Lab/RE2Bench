[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the function step by step.

Given inputs:
- text = "vzzv2sg"
- char = "z"

Step 1: Calculate `char * 2`
- char * 2 = "z" * 2 = "zz"

Step 2: Count occurrences of "zz" in text
- text.count("zz") counts how many times "zz" appears in "vzzv2sg"
- Looking at "vzzv2sg": we have "zz" appearing once (at positions 1-2)
- count = 1

Step 3: Return text[count:]
- text[1:] means we slice the string starting from index 1 to the end
- "vzzv2sg"[1:] = "zzv2sg"

So the function returns "zzv2sg"

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "zzv2sg"
}
