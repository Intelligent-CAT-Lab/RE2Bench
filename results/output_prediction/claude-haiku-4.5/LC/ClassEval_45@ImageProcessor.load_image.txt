[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution:

1. The `load_image` method is called with `image_path = "/home/changshu/ClassEval/data/benchmark_solution_code/test.png"`
2. The method executes: `self.image = Image.open(image_path)`
3. `Image.open()` from PIL opens an image file and returns an Image object
4. This Image object is assigned to `self.image`
5. The method doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it returns `None` by default

The method modifies the instance state (sets `self.image`) but doesn't return anything.
