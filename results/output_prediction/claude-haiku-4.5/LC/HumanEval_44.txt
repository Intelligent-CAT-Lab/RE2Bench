[THOUGHT]
Let me execute the `change_base` function step by step with x=4 and base=5.

Initial state:
- x = 4
- base = 5
- ret = ''

Iteration 1:
- x > 0? Yes (4 > 0)
- x % base = 4 % 5 = 4
- str(4) = '4'
- ret = '4' + '' = '4'
- x //= base → x = 4 // 5 = 0

Iteration 2:
- x > 0? No (0 > 0 is False)
- Loop exits

The function returns ret = '4'

So the number 4 in base 10 is represented as '4' in base 5 (which makes sense since 4 < 5, it's a single digit in base 5).
