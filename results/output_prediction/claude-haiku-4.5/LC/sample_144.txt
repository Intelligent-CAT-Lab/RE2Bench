[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.

1. The function `f` takes one parameter `vectors`.
2. From the input, `vectors` is an empty list: `[]`
3. Initialize `sorted_vecs = []` as an empty list.
4. The for loop `for vec in vectors:` will iterate over the elements in `vectors`.
5. Since `vectors` is empty, the loop body will not execute at all (0 iterations).
6. After the loop completes (without executing any iterations), the function returns `sorted_vecs`, which is still an empty list `[]`.

So the output will be an empty list.
