[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this step by step.

1. The `match` method is called with:
   - pattern: "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
   - text: "iustd87t2euhifg.com"

2. The pattern is an email regex pattern that requires:
   - \b (word boundary)
   - [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+ (one or more alphanumeric, dot, underscore, percent, plus, or minus)
   - @ (literal @)
   - [A-Za-z0-9.-]+ (one or more alphanumeric, dot, or hyphen)
   - \. (literal dot)
   - [A-Z|a-z]{2,} (2 or more letters)
   - \b (word boundary)

3. The text is "iustd87t2euhifg.com" which:
   - Contains no @ symbol
   - Is just a domain name without the email user part

4. re.match(pattern, text) tries to match the pattern at the beginning of the text.
   - It looks for an @ symbol in "iustd87t2euhifg.com"
   - The text does not contain an @ symbol
   - Therefore, re.match will return None

5. Since ans is None (falsy), the condition `if ans:` evaluates to False
6. The method returns False
