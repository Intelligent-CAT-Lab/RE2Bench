[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `ridge_regression`:

1. The function `ridge_regression` is called with:
   - X: a 6x5 matrix
   - y: a 6-element vector
   - alpha: 1.0
   - solver: "cholesky"
   - random_state: RandomState(MT19937)
   - sample_weight: None
   - max_iter: 500
   - tol: 1e-10
   - return_n_iter: False
   - return_intercept: False
   - check_input: True (default)

2. The function calls `_ridge_regression` with the same parameters plus:
   - X_scale=None
   - X_offset=None

3. Since we don't have the implementation of `_ridge_regression` shown in the code, I need to infer what it returns based on the parameters:
   - return_n_iter=False means we don't return the number of iterations
   - return_intercept=False means we don't return the intercept separately
   - The function should solve the ridge regression problem: (X^T X + alpha*I) w = X^T y

4. The ridge regression solver with "cholesky" method will return the coefficients (weights) as a numpy array.

5. Since both `return_n_iter` and `return_intercept` are False, the function will return just the coefficient vector as a 1D numpy array.

6. The ridge regression solution for this input would be a 5-element array (since X has 5 features), containing the learned weights.

Given that:
- X is 6x5
- y is 6-element
- alpha = 1.0
- solver = "cholesky"

The output should be a 1D numpy array of shape (5,) containing the ridge regression coefficients. The exact values would depend on the ridge regression calculation, but it would be an array of 5 floating point values.

Since the function's code only shows the wrapper that calls `_ridge_regression`, and without seeing the actual implementation of `_ridge_regression`, the most accurate prediction is that it returns a numpy array of coefficients.

The return value should be a numpy array of coefficients (5 elements for 5 features).
