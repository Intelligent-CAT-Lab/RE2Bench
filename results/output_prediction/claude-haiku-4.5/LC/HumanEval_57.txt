[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `monotonic` takes a list `l` as input.
2. The input list is `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`

3. The function checks two conditions:
   - First condition: `l == sorted(l)`
     - `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` returns `[9, 9, 9, 9]`
     - `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]` evaluates to `True`
   
   - Since the first condition is `True`, the entire `or` expression is `True`

4. The function returns `True`

The list [9, 9, 9, 9] is monotonically non-decreasing (all elements are equal), so it satisfies the first condition where the list equals its sorted version.
