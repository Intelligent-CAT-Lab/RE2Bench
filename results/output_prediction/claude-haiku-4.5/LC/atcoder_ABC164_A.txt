[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input is `"74 74"` (a string containing two space-separated numbers).
2. `S, W = map(int, input().split())` reads the input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each part to an integer.
   - `input()` returns `"74 74"`
   - `.split()` returns `["74", "74"]`
   - `map(int, ...)` converts these to integers: `S = 74` and `W = 74`
3. The conditional statement checks: `if S <= W`
   - Is `74 <= 74`? Yes, this is True.
4. Since the condition is True, the code executes `print('unsafe')`.
5. The output will be `"unsafe"`.
