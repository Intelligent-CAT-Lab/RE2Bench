[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have `planet1 = "Earth"` and `planet2 = "Earth"`
2. `planet_names = ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')`
3. We check the condition: `if planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2:`
   - `planet1 not in planet_names`: "Earth" is in planet_names, so this is False
   - `planet2 not in planet_names`: "Earth" is in planet_names, so this is False
   - `planet1 == planet2`: "Earth" == "Earth" is True
4. Since the third condition is True, the overall if condition evaluates to True
5. When the condition is True, the function returns `()`
6. So the function returns an empty tuple
