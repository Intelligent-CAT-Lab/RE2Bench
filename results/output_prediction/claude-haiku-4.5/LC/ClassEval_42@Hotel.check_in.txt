[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `check_in` with the given input:

1. `self.name = "Test Hotel"`
2. `self.available_rooms = {"single": 1, "double": 2}`
3. `self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}`
4. `room_type = "single"`
5. `room_number = 2`
6. `name = "guest 1"`

Now let's execute the `check_in` method:

1. First condition: `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`
   - `self.booked_rooms.keys()` = `dict_keys(['single'])`
   - `room_type = "single"` is in the keys
   - So this condition is False, we don't return False

2. Second condition: `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`
   - `self.booked_rooms[room_type]` = `self.booked_rooms["single"]` = `{}`
   - `name = "guest 1"` is NOT in this empty dictionary
   - So this condition is False

3. Since neither condition is True, none of the nested code blocks execute, and the function returns `None` (implicit return when no explicit return statement is reached).
