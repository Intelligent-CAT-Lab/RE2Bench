[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input and computes the sum of squares of the ceiling values of each element.

Given input: `lst = [-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`

1. Initialize `squared = 0`
2. Loop through each element in `lst`:
   - First iteration: `i = -1.4`
     - `math.ceil(-1.4)` = `-1` (ceiling of -1.4 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -1.4, which is -1)
     - `(-1) ** 2` = `1`
     - `squared = 0 + 1 = 1`
   
   - Second iteration: `i = 17.9`
     - `math.ceil(17.9)` = `18`
     - `18 ** 2` = `324`
     - `squared = 1 + 324 = 325`
   
   - Third iteration: `i = 18.9`
     - `math.ceil(18.9)` = `19`
     - `19 ** 2` = `361`
     - `squared = 325 + 361 = 686`
   
   - Fourth iteration: `i = 19.9`
     - `math.ceil(19.9)` = `20`
     - `20 ** 2` = `400`
     - `squared = 686 + 400 = 1086`

3. Return `squared = 1086`
