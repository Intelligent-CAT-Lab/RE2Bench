[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of the `restock_item` method step by step.

1. The method is called with `item_name="Pizza"` and `quantity=10`
2. The current inventory contains: `{"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 10}}`
3. The method checks: `if item_name in self.inventory:`
4. This checks if "Pizza" is in the inventory dictionary
5. The inventory only has "Coke", not "Pizza"
6. So the condition `"Pizza" in inventory` evaluates to `False`
7. Since the condition is False, we skip the if block and go to the else block
8. The else block returns `False`

Therefore, the function returns `False` because "Pizza" is not already in the inventory.
