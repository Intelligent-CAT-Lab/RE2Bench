[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `_interval_contains_close` with the given inputs:

1. `interval = [0.001, 1.0]`
2. `val = 0.2`
3. `rtol = 1e-10`

Step 1: Unpack the interval
```
a, b = interval
a = 0.001
b = 1.0
```

Step 2: Check if a > b
```
0.001 > 1.0 is False, so we don't swap
a = 0.001
b = 1.0
```

Step 3: Calculate rtol adjustment
```
rtol = (b - a) * rtol
rtol = (1.0 - 0.001) * 1e-10
rtol = 0.999 * 1e-10
rtol = 9.99e-11
```

Step 4: Check if value is within the interval with tolerance
```
a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
0.001 - 9.99e-11 <= 0.2 <= 1.0 + 9.99e-11
0.00099999999 <= 0.2 <= 1.0000000000999
```

Since `0.2` is clearly within this range (it's between 0.00099999999 and 1.0000000000999), the condition is True.

The function returns True.
