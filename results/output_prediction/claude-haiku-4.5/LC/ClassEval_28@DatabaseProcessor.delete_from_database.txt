[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `delete_from_database` step by step.

1. The method is called with:
   - self.database_name = "test.db"
   - table_name = "test_table"
   - name = "Alice"

2. conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name) → connects to "test.db"

3. cursor = conn.cursor() → creates a cursor object

4. delete_query = f'DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?' → constructs the SQL query:
   "DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?"

5. cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,)) → executes the query with parameter ("Alice",)
   This would delete all rows from test_table where name = "Alice"

6. conn.commit() → commits the transaction

7. conn.close() → closes the database connection

8. The function does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns None by default.

The function performs a database operation (DELETE) but doesn't return any value. It will return None implicitly.
