[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the execution of `is_palindrome` with the input text "xywzx".

The function checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends moving towards the center.

Initial: text = "xywzx", length = 5

Loop iterations:
- i = 0: text[0] = 'x', text[5-1-0] = text[4] = 'x'. 'x' == 'x' ✓ Continue
- i = 1: text[1] = 'y', text[5-1-1] = text[3] = 'z'. 'y' != 'z' ✗ Return False

At i=1, we find that text[1] ('y') does not equal text[3] ('z'), so the function returns False immediately.

The string "xywzx" is not a palindrome because when we compare characters from the outside in:
- Position 0 and 4: 'x' and 'x' match
- Position 1 and 3: 'y' and 'z' don't match

Therefore, the output is False.
