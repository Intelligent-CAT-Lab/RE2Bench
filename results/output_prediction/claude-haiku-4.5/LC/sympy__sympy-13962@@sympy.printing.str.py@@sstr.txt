I need to trace through the execution of `sstr(expr, **settings)` where `expr` is some object with `_array_form: null` and `_size: 6`.

Let me work through this step by step:

1. `sstr(expr, **settings)` is called with `expr` being an object (appears to be a Permutation based on the structure)
2. `p = StrPrinter(settings)` creates a StrPrinter instance
3. `s = p.doprint(expr)` is called

In `doprint`:
- It calls `self._str(self._print(expr))`
- `self._str` is `str` (the built-in)
- So we need to determine what `self._print(expr)` returns

In `_print`:
- It increments `_print_level`
- It checks if the object has a `printmethod` - this depends on the Printer class but isn't set in the input
- It then iterates through the MRO (Method Resolution Order) of the object's type
- It looks for a method named `_print_` + classname

The object has `_array_form: null` and `_size: 6`, which matches the structure of a `Permutation` object (based on the properties visible in the functions).

Looking at `_print_Permutation`:
```python
def _print_Permutation(self, expr):
    from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation, Cycle
    if Permutation.print_cyclic:
        if not expr.size:
            return '()'
        s = Cycle(expr)(expr.size - 1).__repr__()[len('Cycle'):]
        # ... more code
    else:
        s = expr.support()
        if not s:
            if expr.size < 5:
                return 'Permutation(%s)' % str(expr.array_form)
            return 'Permutation([], size=%s)' % expr.size
        # ... more code
```

The input shows `_size: 6`, so `expr.size` would be 6.

Since `_array_form` is null in the input (which would be an empty or uninitialized state), and assuming `Permutation.print_cyclic` is False (the default), we'd go to the else branch.

`expr.support()` would return an empty list since `_array_form` is null, so we'd check `if not s:` which is True.

Since `expr.size` is 6, which is not `< 5`, we'd execute:
```python
return 'Permutation([], size=%s)' % expr.size
```

This returns: `'Permutation([], size=6)'`

Then `doprint` does `self._str(...)` which applies the `str()` function to this string, returning it unchanged.

</THOUGHT>

```
{
    "output": "Permutation([], size=6)"
}
