[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. We have a ShoppingCart instance with self.items = {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 4}}
2. remove_item is called with item="apple" and quantity=1 (default)
3. Check if "apple" is in self.items - YES, it is
4. Execute: self.items["apple"]['quantity'] -= 1
   - self.items["apple"]['quantity'] is currently 4
   - 4 - 1 = 3
   - self.items["apple"]['quantity'] becomes 3
5. The function doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it returns None

After execution, self.items would be {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 3}}, but the function itself returns None.
