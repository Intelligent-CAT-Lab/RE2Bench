Let's execute the code step by step.

1. __init__(radius=2) stores self.radius = 2
2. calculate_sphere_area() is called
3. The formula for sphere surface area is: 4 * π * r²
4. With radius = 2:
   - radius² = 2² = 4
   - 4 * π * 4 = 16 * π
   - 16 * math.pi ≈ 16 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 50.26548245743669

So calculate_sphere_area() will return approximately 50.26548245743669
