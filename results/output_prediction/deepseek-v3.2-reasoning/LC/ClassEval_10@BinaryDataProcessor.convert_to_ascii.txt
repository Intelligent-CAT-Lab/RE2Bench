[THOUGHT]
We are given an instance of BinaryDataProcessor with binary_string = "01101000011001010110001001101111". The method convert_to_ascii splits this into 8-bit chunks, converts each to decimal, and decodes as ASCII. The binary string has 32 bits, so we have four chunks:
1. "01101000" → decimal 104 → ASCII 'h'
2. "01100101" → decimal 101 → ASCII 'e'
3. "01100010" → decimal 98 → ASCII 'b'
4. "01101111" → decimal 111 → ASCII 'o'
Concatenating these gives "hebo". The clean_non_binary_chars method does not affect the string since it only contains '0' and '1'. Thus, the output is "hebo".
