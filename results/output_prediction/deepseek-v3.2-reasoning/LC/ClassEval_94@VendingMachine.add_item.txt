[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step:
1. The `add_item` method is called with arguments `item_name="Coke"`, `price=1.25`, `quantity=10`.
2. The method first calls `restock_item("Coke", 10)`.
3. Inside `restock_item`, it checks if "Coke" is in `self.inventory`.
4. The current inventory has "Coke" with price 1.25 and quantity 20, so `item_name in self.inventory` returns True.
5. Since the item exists, it updates the quantity: `self.inventory["Coke"]['quantity'] += 10` → 20 + 10 = 30.
6. `restock_item` returns True.
7. Back in `add_item`, since `restock_item` returned True, the if condition is True, so it does NOT execute the code block that would create a new inventory entry.
8. The `add_item` method has no explicit return statement, so it returns None by default.

Therefore, the output of the function call is None.
