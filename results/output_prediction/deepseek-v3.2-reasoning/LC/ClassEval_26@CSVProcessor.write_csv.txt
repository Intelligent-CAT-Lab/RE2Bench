[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the `write_csv` method of `CSVProcessor`. The method takes `data` and `file_name`, writes the data to the CSV file, and returns 1 on success, 0 on any exception.

Given input:
- `data = [["a", "b", "c", "d"], ["ME"]]`
- `file_name = "read_test_process.csv"`

The method will attempt to open the file for writing and write the rows using `csv.writer.writerows`. The data is a valid list of lists of strings. Assuming the file system allows writing (no permission errors, disk space, etc.), the operation will succeed and return 1. No exception is expected, so the output is 1.

Thus, the output value is `1`.
