[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function call step by step.

The function is defined as:
def f(nums, pop1, pop2):
    nums.pop(pop1 - 1)
    nums.pop(pop2 - 1)
    return nums

Given inputs: nums = [1, 2, 3], pop1 = 2, pop2 = 4.

Step 1: Compute pop1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Call nums.pop(1). This removes the element at index 1 from the list nums. The list initially is [1, 2, 3]. After popping index 1, the element 2 is removed, and nums becomes [1, 3].

Step 2: Compute pop2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Call nums.pop(3). At this point, nums is [1, 3] with indices 0 and 1. Index 3 is out of range because the list has length 2. Therefore, this operation raises an IndexError: pop index out of range.

Since an exception is raised, the function does not reach the return statement. Thus, the function does not return a value; it raises an IndexError.

Therefore, the output of the function is an IndexError exception.
