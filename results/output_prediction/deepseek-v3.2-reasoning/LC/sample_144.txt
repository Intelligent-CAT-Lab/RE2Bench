[THOUGHT]
The function f takes one argument vectors. In the input, vectors is an empty list. The function initializes an empty list sorted_vecs. It then iterates over each vec in vectors. Since vectors is empty, the loop does nothing. Then it returns sorted_vecs, which is an empty list. So output is [].
