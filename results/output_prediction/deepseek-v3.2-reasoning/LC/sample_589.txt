[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `f(num)` that takes a list `num`. The input list is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`. The function appends the last element of the list (`num[-1]`) to the same list, modifying it in-place. The last element is `1`, so after appending, the list becomes `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`. The function returns this modified list. So the output should be that list.
