[THOUGHT]
1. The function `__eq__` is called with `self` (an instance of `_StrPath`) and `other` (a string).
2. Since `other` is a string, the condition `isinstance(other, PurePath)` is false.
3. The condition `isinstance(other, str)` is true, so a deprecation warning is issued (but does not affect the return value).
4. The method returns `self.__str__() == other`.
5. We need to know `self.__str__()`. The input does not specify the path for `self`. However, the string `other` is `"_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')"`, which is a string representation of a `_StrPath` object. The `__str__` method of `_StrPath` returns the path as a string (without the class name and parentheses). Therefore, unless `self` is a `_StrPath` object whose string representation is exactly that string, the comparison will be false. Given that `self` is not specified, but typically such a comparison is intended to return false, we predict the output as false.
