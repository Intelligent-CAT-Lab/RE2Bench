[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.
1. The input array is [1, 2, 1].
2. `new_array = array.copy()` creates a copy, so new_array becomes [1, 2, 1].
3. `new_array = reversed(new_array)` assigns new_array to a reversed iterator over the list [1, 2, 1]. The iterator yields elements in reverse order: first 1 (the last element of the original list), then 2 (the middle element), then 1 (the first element). So the sequence is 1, 2, 1.
4. The list comprehension `[x * x for x in new_array]` iterates over this iterator:
   - For the first element (1): 1 * 1 = 1.
   - For the second element (2): 2 * 2 = 4.
   - For the third element (1): 1 * 1 = 1.
5. The result is the list [1, 4, 1].
Thus, the function returns [1, 4, 1].
