[THOUGHT]
We are given an instance of Thermostat with current_temperature=25, target_temperature=25, mode="cool". The method auto_set_mode compares current_temperature and target_temperature. Since current_temperature is not less than target_temperature, it sets self.mode to 'cool'. The method does not return any value, so it returns None. Therefore, the output of the function call is None.
