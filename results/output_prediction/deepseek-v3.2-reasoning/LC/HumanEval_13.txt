We need to compute the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15 using the given Euclidean algorithm function.

Step-by-step execution:
1. Initial values: a = 10, b = 15
2. First iteration: b ≠ 0 (15 ≠ 0), so enter loop:
   - Compute: a, b = (b, a % b) = (15, 10 % 15) = (15, 10)
   - Now a = 15, b = 10
3. Second iteration: b ≠ 0 (10 ≠ 0), so enter loop:
   - Compute: a, b = (b, a % b) = (10, 15 % 10) = (10, 5)
   - Now a = 10, b = 5
4. Third iteration: b ≠ 0 (5 ≠ 0), so enter loop:
   - Compute: a, b = (b, a % b) = (5, 10 % 5) = (5, 0)
   - Now a = 5, b = 0
5. Loop condition: b = 0, so exit loop.
6. Return a = 5.

Thus, the output is 5.
