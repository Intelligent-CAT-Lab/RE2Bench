[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f(s, n, c). Let's execute step by step with the given inputs: s = ".", n = 0, c = "99".

1. Compute width = len(c) * n. len(c) = len("99") = 2. n = 0, so width = 2 * 0 = 0.
2. Compute width - len(s) = 0 - len(".") = 0 - 1 = -1.
3. The for loop: for _ in range(width - len(s)) becomes for _ in range(-1). In Python, range(-1) is empty because when the stop value is less than or equal to 0, the range contains no elements. So the loop body does not execute.
4. Therefore, s remains unchanged: ".".
5. The function returns s, which is ".".

So the output is ".".
