[THOUGHT]
The input array is empty: [].

First while loop: condition "-1 in array" checks if -1 is in the array. Since the array is empty, condition is false, so no operations.

Second while loop: condition "0 in array" is false.

Third while loop: condition "1 in array" is false.

Thus, the function returns the array unchanged, which is [].

Therefore, output is [].
