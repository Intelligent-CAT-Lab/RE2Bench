[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers a, b, c, d from input. It then computes the maximum of the four products: a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d. Given the input values: a=193944314, b=586260100, c=-192321079, d=95834122. Since c is negative, a*c and b*c are negative. d is positive, so a*d and b*d are positive. Therefore, the maximum is the larger of a*d and b*d. Since b > a and d > 0, b*d > a*d. Thus, ans = b*d. Computing b*d: 586260100 * 95834122 = 56183721947132200.
