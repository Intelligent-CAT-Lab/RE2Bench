[THOUGHT]
The `delete_from_database` method performs a DELETE operation on a SQLite database but does not return any value. It opens a connection, executes the DELETE query, commits the change, and closes the connection. The method returns `None` (implicitly since there's no return statement). Therefore, the output should be `null` in JSON format.
