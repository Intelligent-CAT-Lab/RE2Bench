[THOUGHT]
We need to determine the output of calling `update_product_quantity` with the given input. The method is defined to check if `product_id` is in `self.inventory`, and if so, update the quantity by adding the given quantity. However, `product_id` is provided as an integer `1`, while the keys in `self.inventory` are strings (`"1"`). Since integer `1` is not equal to string `"1"`, the condition `product_id in self.inventory` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the method does not modify the inventory and returns `None` (implicitly). The output should be `None`, which in JSON is represented as `null`.
