[THOUGHT]
1. The `get_snap` method simply returns the value of `self._snap` attribute.
2. From the input JSON, we see that `self._snap` is set to `null` (which corresponds to Python's `None`).
3. Therefore, the output of calling `get_snap()` will be `None`.
4. In the output structure, we need to replace XXX with the value of `self._snap`, which is `null` in JSON format.
