[THOUGHT]
The `level_up` method increments the character's level by 1 (if below 100), resets exp to 0, increases hp by 20, attack_power by 5, and defense by 5, then returns a tuple of (level, hp, attack_power, defense). Given self with level=3, hp=140, attack_power=30, defense=20, exp=0. After level_up: level=4, hp=160, attack_power=35, defense=25, exp reset to 0. The method returns (4, 160, 35, 25). This tuple is represented as a JSON array in the output.
