[THOUGHT]
Given the DiscountStrategy instance with __total = 150.0, and promotion being a callable function. Since the promotion function is not defined in the provided code, we must infer its behavior from typical examples. Given the customer has fidelity 1200, a common promotion is to give a 5% discount if fidelity > 1000. Therefore, discount = 150.0 * 0.05 = 7.5. The due amount is 150.0 - 7.5 = 142.5.
