[THOUGHT]
The function `is_prime(n)` checks if `n` is prime by testing divisibility by all integers from 2 to `n-1`. For `n = 13441`, the loop will iterate from 2 to 13440. Since 13441 is prime (verified by checking divisibility by all primes up to √13441 ≈ 115.96, none divide it), the loop will not find any divisor. Thus, the function returns `True`. In JSON output, booleans are represented as `true` or `false`.
