[THOUGHT]
1. The function `dup_l1_norm` is called with arguments `f = [1, 2]` and `K = "ZZ"` (interpreted as the integer domain).
2. Since `f` is not empty, we compute `dup_abs(f, K)`.
3. `dup_abs` returns a list of absolute values of coefficients: `[abs(1), abs(2)]` which is `[1, 2]`.
4. Then we compute `K.sum([1, 2])`. For the integer domain, `K.zero` is 0, so the sum is 1+2 = 3.
5. Therefore, the output is 3.
