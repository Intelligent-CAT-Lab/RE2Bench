[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `decimal_to_binary` is called with `decimal=0`.
2. `bin(0)` returns the string '0b0'.
3. Slicing with `[2:]` gives the substring starting from index 2, which is '0'.
4. The result is constructed as 'db' + '0' + 'db', which equals 'db0db'.
5. The function returns 'db0db'.
Therefore, the output should be the string 'db0db'.
