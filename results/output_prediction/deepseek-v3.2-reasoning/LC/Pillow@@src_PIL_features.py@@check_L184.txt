[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the execution of `check("freetype2")`. The function first checks if "freetype2" is in `modules`, then in `codecs`, then in `features`. Without the actual dictionaries, we assume "freetype2" is a known feature and is in `features`. Therefore, `check_feature("freetype2")` is called.

Inside `check_feature`, we assume the feature is defined in `features` (so no ValueError). It retrieves the module name, flag name, and version. Then it attempts to import the module. We assume the import succeeds (no ModuleNotFoundError) and that the flag attribute exists and is True. Thus `check_feature` returns True. Therefore, `check` returns True.

Thus the output is True.
