[THOUGHT]
1. The function `get_display_profile` is called with `handle=None`.
2. The function checks `sys.platform`. Since the platform is not specified in the input, and the function is part of a cross-platform library, we cannot assume a specific platform. However, the function's behavior depends on `sys.platform`. Without explicit information, the most conservative assumption is that the platform is not Windows (e.g., Linux or macOS), causing the function to return `None` immediately.
3. Even if the platform were Windows, the return value of `core.get_display_profile_win32(0)` is unknown, and we lack the definition of `ImageCmsProfile`. Thus, we cannot determine a non-`None` output.
4. Therefore, the output is `None`.
