[THOUGHT]
The `add_book` method modifies the inventory in place but does not return any value. Therefore, its output is `None`. In JSON, `None` is represented as `null`.

Given the initial inventory: `{"book1": 2, "book2": 1}` and calling `add_book("book2")`, the quantity for "book2" increases by 1 (default quantity), resulting in `{"book1": 2, "book2": 2}`. However, the method returns nothing, so the output of the function call is `None`.
