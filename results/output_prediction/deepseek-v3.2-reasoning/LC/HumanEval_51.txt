We need to compute the output of `remove_vowels(text)` where text is "abcdef\nghijklm". The function removes all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) by checking if the lowercase version of each character is in the list ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']. It iterates over each character in the input string and keeps only those that are not vowels.

Let's process each character:
- 'a' -> lowercase 'a' is a vowel -> skip.
- 'b' -> not a vowel -> keep.
- 'c' -> keep.
- 'd' -> keep.
- 'e' -> vowel -> skip.
- 'f' -> keep.
- '\n' -> newline character, lowercase is still '\n', not a vowel -> keep.
- 'g' -> keep.
- 'h' -> keep.
- 'i' -> vowel -> skip.
- 'j' -> keep.
- 'k' -> keep.
- 'l' -> keep.
- 'm' -> keep.

The resulting string is formed by joining the kept characters in order: "bcdf\nghjklm".

Note that the newline character is preserved. In JSON output, we represent this string with the newline escaped as \n.

Thus, the output value is "bcdf\nghjklm".
