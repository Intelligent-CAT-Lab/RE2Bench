[THOUGHT]
1. The function `template_changed` is called with `file_path` as a Path object representing "/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/index.html".
2. The suffix of `file_path` is ".html", so the early return condition (for ".py" files) is not triggered.
3. `get_template_directories()` is called to retrieve a set of template directories. Without explicit configuration details, we assume typical Django behavior where the "templates" directory inside an app is included. Given the file path is under a `templates` directory and the context appears to be a test environment, it is reasonable to assume that `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/` is included in the set of template directories.
4. The loop iterates over each template directory and checks if it is a parent of `file_path`. Since `/testbed/tests/template_tests/templates/` is exactly the parent directory of `index.html`, the condition `template_dir in file_path.parents` evaluates to True.
5. Consequently, `reset_loaders()` is called and the function returns `True`.
