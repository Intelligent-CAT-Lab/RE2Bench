[THOUGHT]
The function `__format_line_feed` is a static method that uses a regular expression to replace sequences of one or more newline characters (`\n+`) with a single newline. The input text is "Some sentence here.", which contains no newline characters. Therefore, the regex pattern does not match anything, and the `re.sub` function returns the original text unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
```
