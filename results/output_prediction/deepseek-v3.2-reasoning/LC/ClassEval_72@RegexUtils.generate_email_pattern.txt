[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern` returns a regex pattern string for matching email addresses. The pattern is defined with double backslashes to escape special regex characters like `\b` (word boundary) and `\.` (literal dot). When the method is called with no arguments, it returns the string exactly as defined in the code. The actual string in memory is: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`. In JSON, backslashes must be escaped, so the string representation becomes: `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\. [A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b`. Therefore, the output value is that escaped string.
