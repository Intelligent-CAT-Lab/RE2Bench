[THOUGHT]
1. The function called is `to_list` of a `DomainMatrix` instance.
2. The method simply calls `self.rep.to_list()`. Based on the structure of `self.rep`, it appears to be an SDM (sparse dictionary of dictionaries) because it is a dict mapping row indices to dicts of column indices.
3. The SDM `to_list` method is defined. It takes the shape (2,2) and creates a 2x2 list filled with the domain's zero. However, the domain is given as "EXRAW". Since we don't have the actual domain object, but the rep has entries for all positions, the initial zeros will be overwritten.
4. The method iterates over `M.items()` which yields (0, row0) and (1, row1). For each row, it iterates over the items in the row dict and assigns the value to the corresponding position in the list.
5. All four positions are present, so the resulting list will contain the values as they are in the rep.
6. The values are strings representing matrices (with newlines). So the output is a 2x2 list of these strings.
