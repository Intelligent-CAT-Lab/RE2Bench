[THOUGHT]
1. We are given a method `_eval_expand_trig` of class `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction`.
2. The method simply returns `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)`.
3. The input `self` has an attribute `nargs` which is a dictionary with key `_args_set` set to the string `"{'1'}"`.
4. The `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
5. We need to simulate the execution: `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)` will be called, but we are not provided with the implementation of `_calculate_reciprocal`.
6. However, from the context, `_calculate_reciprocal` likely returns some object that has a `nargs` attribute with `_args_set`.
7. Since we don't have the actual implementation, and the output structure expects a value for `nargs._args_set`, we must infer from the input that the method returns something similar to `self` or a transformed version.
8. The input `self.nargs._args_set` is `"{'1'}"`, which is a string representation of a set containing the string `'1'`. This might be related to the number of arguments.
9. Without additional information, the most reasonable assumption is that the method returns the same `self` object (or an object with the same `nargs`), since the method is a simple delegation and the input `kwargs` is empty.
10. Therefore, the output `nargs._args_set` should be the same as the input: `"{'1'}"`.
