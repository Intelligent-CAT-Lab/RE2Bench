[THOUGHT]
1. The function `__lt__` is called on an instance of `Integer` representing the integer 3, with `other` being the string "1".
2. Inside `__lt__`, it attempts to convert `other` using `_sympify(other)`. Since `other` is the string "1" and `_sympify` uses `strict=True`, it raises a `SympifyError` because strings are excluded in strict mode.
3. The exception is caught, and the method returns `NotImplemented`.
4. Therefore, the output of the function is `NotImplemented`.
