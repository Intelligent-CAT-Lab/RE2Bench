[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of the `subtract` method in the `ComplexCalculator` class given the inputs. The inputs are provided as strings in the JSON, but they represent complex numbers. The function expects complex numbers and accesses their `.real` and `.imag` attributes.

Interpret c1 as the complex number -1+2j and c2 as -3+4j.

Compute:
real part = c1.real - c2.real = (-1) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2.
imaginary part = c1.imag - c2.imag = 2 - 4 = -2.

The function returns `complex(2, -2)`, which is the complex number (2-2j). In Python, the string representation of this complex number is "(2-2j)".

Since the output structure expects a JSON value and complex numbers are not natively supported in JSON, we output the string representation "(2-2j)".
