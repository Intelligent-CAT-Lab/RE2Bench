[THOUGHT]
1. We are given a Permutation object with `_array_form` = None and `_size` = 5.
2. The `__invert__` method returns `self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`.
3. Since `self._array_form` is None, we need to interpret what `_af_invert(None)` would return. The function `_af_invert` is not defined in the snippet, but typically it expects a list representing a permutation. However, in the context of the Permutation class, when `_array_form` is None and `_size` is given, it often represents the identity permutation.
4. The identity permutation of size 5 has array form `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Its inverse is itself.
5. Therefore, `_af_invert([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
6. The new Permutation object created by `self._af_new` will have `_array_form` = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` = 5 (since the size is preserved under inversion).
7. Thus, the output should have `_array_form` = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` = 5.
