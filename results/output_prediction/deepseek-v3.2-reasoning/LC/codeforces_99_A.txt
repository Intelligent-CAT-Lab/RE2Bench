[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the second code snippet step by step.

1. The `input()` function reads the string "2.4" from standard input.
2. `split('.')` splits the string at the decimal point, resulting in the list `['2', '4']` assigned to `num`.
3. The first condition checks if the last digit of the integer part (the string `num[0]`, which is "2") is equal to 9. `num[0][-1]` is '2', and `int('2')` is 2, which is not equal to 9. So this condition is false.
4. The `elif` condition checks if the first digit of the fractional part (the string `num[1]`, which is "4") is greater than or equal to 5. `num[1][0]` is '4', and `int('4')` is 4, which is not >= 5. So this condition is also false.
5. Since both conditions are false, the `else` branch executes, printing `num[0]`, which is "2".

Thus, the output of the program for the given input is "2".
