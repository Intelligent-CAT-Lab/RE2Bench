[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the `split` method of `RegexUtils`. The method uses `re.split(pattern, text)`. The provided pattern is `\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b` (after interpreting the escaped backslashes). This pattern matches phone numbers like "123-456-7890". The text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767". The pattern will match three phone numbers: "123-456-7890", "876-286-9876", and "987-762-9767". `re.split` will split the text at these matches, returning a list of the substrings between matches. Since the matches occur at the beginning, middle, and end, the result will be: an empty string before the first match, the string between the first and second match (including surrounding spaces), the string between the second and third match, and an empty string after the third match. Specifically: 
- Before "123-456-7890": `''`
- Between "123-456-7890" and "876-286-9876": `' abiguygusu '` (note spaces)
- Between "876-286-9876" and "987-762-9767": `' kjgufwycs '` (note spaces)
- After "987-762-9767": `''`
Thus, the output list is `['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']`.
