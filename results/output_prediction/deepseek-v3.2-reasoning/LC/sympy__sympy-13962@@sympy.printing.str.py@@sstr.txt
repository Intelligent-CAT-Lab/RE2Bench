[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `sstr` with the given input. The input provides:
- `self`: empty dict (since `sstr` is a function, not a method)
- `args`: `{"expr": {"_array_form": null, "_size": 6}}`
- `kwargs`: `{"order": null}`

The function `sstr` creates a `StrPrinter` with settings (here empty), then calls `doprint` on the expression. The expression is a dictionary representing a Permutation object (from sympy.combinatorics.permutations). Specifically, it has `_array_form: null` and `_size: 6`. We need to determine how `StrPrinter._print_Permutation` handles this.

Looking at the provided `_print_Permutation` function:
- It checks `Permutation.print_cyclic` (not provided, assume default).
- If `Permutation.print_cyclic` is True, it prints in cyclic form; else, it prints in array form.
- In the non-cyclic branch: it calls `expr.support()`.
- `support()` returns indices where permutation changes the element. For an identity permutation, support is empty.
- If `support()` is empty: if `expr.size < 5`, it prints `Permutation(array_form)`; else, it prints `Permutation([], size=expr.size)`.

Here, `expr.size` is 6 (≥5), and `expr.array_form` is null. However, the identity permutation of size 6 has array form `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. But the input says `_array_form: null`. This might indicate an identity permutation where `_array_form` is not stored (maybe lazy). In practice, the `array_form` property would compute it. But given the provided functions, `_print_Permutation` uses `expr.array_form` (via `expr.array_form` property). Since `_array_form` is null, the `array_form` property might return `null`? Actually, from provided `Permutation.__new__`, if no args, it creates identity via `_af_new(list(range(size)))`, setting `_array_form`. So `_array_form` should not be null. But the input explicitly has `null`. Perhaps it's a placeholder meaning "identity". We must simulate based on given info.

We also need to consider `Permutation.print_cyclic`. Not provided, but from SymPy defaults, it's False. So we use non-cyclic branch.

Given `expr.size = 6` and `expr.array_form` is null? But `support()` uses `array_form`. If `array_form` is null, enumerating it would cause an error. However, the input likely intends an identity permutation. Let's check `support` code: it uses `self.array_form`, which returns `self._array_form[:]`. If `_array_form` is null, slicing `null` would error. But perhaps `_array_form` is set to a list when accessed? Not in provided code.

Given the ambiguity, I'll assume the identity permutation: array_form = [0,1,2,3,4,5]. Then support is empty. Since size=6 ≥5, output should be `'Permutation([], size=6)'`.

Thus, `sstr` returns that string.
