[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `add_elements` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k`.
2. It considers the first `k` elements of `arr` using slicing: `arr[:k]`. Given `k=4`, the slice is `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.
3. For each element in this slice, it checks if the length of its string representation is less than or equal to 2: `len(str(elem)) <= 2`.
   - `str(111)` is "111", length 3 -> not included.
   - `str(21)` is "21", length 2 -> included.
   - `str(3)` is "3", length 1 -> included.
   - `str(4000)` is "4000", length 4 -> not included.
4. The generator yields the included elements: 21 and 3.
5. The `sum` function adds these: 21 + 3 = 24.
6. The function returns 24.
