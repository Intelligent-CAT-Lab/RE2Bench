[THOUGHT]
1. The `__eq__` method first compares the class of `other` with the class of `self`. Since `self` is an instance of `IndirectReference` and `other` is a list (`[1, 2]`), `other.__class__ is self.__class__` evaluates to `False`.
2. Because the class check fails, the method returns `False` without further attribute comparisons.
3. Thus, the output is `False`.
