[THOUGHT]
1. The function `math_to_image` is called with s="$x^2$", filename_or_obj=PosixPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-46/test_math_to_image0/example.png'), and other arguments as None.
2. It creates a MathTextParser for 'path' (vector output).
3. It calls `parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)`. This returns the dimensions of the math expression. For the string "$x^2$", the depth (descent below baseline) is typically 0 because there are no descenders in the expression.
4. The function then creates a figure with the size based on the width and height, adds the text, and saves the figure.
5. The function returns the depth, which is 0.0.
