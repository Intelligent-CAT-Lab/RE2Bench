[THOUGHT]
1. The function `interval_contains` is called with `interval` = [-107.73502692, -7.73502692] (interpreting the string representation as a list of two floats) and `val` = -80.0.
2. The function unpacks `interval` into `a` and `b`, so `a` = -107.73502692 and `b` = -7.73502692.
3. It checks if `a > b`: -107.73502692 > -7.73502692 is false, so no swap occurs.
4. It returns `a <= val <= b`: -107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692 evaluates to True.
5. Therefore, the output is True.
