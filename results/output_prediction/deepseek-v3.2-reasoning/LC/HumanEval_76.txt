[THOUGHT]
We are to compute the output of `is_simple_power(x=1, n=1)`.

Step-by-step:
1. The function `is_simple_power` first checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 1, this condition is true.
2. It then returns `x == 1`. Since `x` is 1, `1 == 1` evaluates to `True`.
3. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

Thus, the output is `True`.
