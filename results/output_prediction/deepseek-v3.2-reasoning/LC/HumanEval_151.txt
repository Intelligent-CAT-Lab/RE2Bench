[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. In this case, the input list is empty: `lst = []`.
3. The list comprehension `[i ** 2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and ('.' not in str(i))]` will iterate over each element in `lst`. Since `lst` is empty, no elements are processed, resulting in an empty list `[]`.
4. The `sum` function applied to an empty list returns `0`.
5. Therefore, the output of the function is `0`.
