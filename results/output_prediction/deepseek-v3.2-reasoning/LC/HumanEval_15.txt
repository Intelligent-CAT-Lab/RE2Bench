Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input. In this case, `n = 10`.
2. The list comprehension `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]` generates numbers from 0 to 10 inclusive, converting each to a string. This yields the list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']`.
3. The `join` method concatenates these strings with a single space as separator, resulting in the string: `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
4. This string is returned as the output.
