[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the function `_polynomial_integrate` with the given input:
- polynomials: {2: "x*y"}
- facets: null (interpreted as None or empty, but since the loop over hp_params does not run, we can treat it as empty)
- hp_params: null (interpreted as an empty iterable for the loop to run zero times)

The function proceeds as follows:
1. `dims = (x, y)` and `dim_length = 2`.
2. `integral_value = S.Zero` (which is 0).
3. The loop over `deg` in `polynomials` has only one key: `deg = 2`.
4. `poly_contribute = S.Zero` and `facet_count = 0`.
5. The loop `for hp in hp_params` is skipped because `hp_params` is null (or empty), so no iterations occur.
6. Then `poly_contribute /= (dim_length + deg) = (2 + 2) = 4`, so `poly_contribute = 0 / 4 = 0`.
7. `integral_value += poly_contribute` remains 0.
8. The function returns `integral_value`, which is 0.

Since the function returns a Sympy integer 0, the output is 0.
