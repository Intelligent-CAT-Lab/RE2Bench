[THOUGHT]
Step-by-step:
1. The input nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
2. Compute count = len(nums) = 5.
3. The loop runs for num in range(2, count): which is range(2,5) -> iterations: 2, 3, 4. So three iterations.
4. In each iteration, nums.sort() is called. The first sort sorts the list: already sorted, so remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
5. Subsequent sorts do nothing since the list remains sorted.
6. The function returns nums, which is unchanged from the original order but sorted (which it already was).
Thus the output is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
