[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst`.
2. Inside, it first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates: `set([5, 1, 4, 3, 2])` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` (all unique).
3. Then it sorts the set: `sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})` gives `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. It checks if the length of this sorted list is less than 2. Here, length is 5, which is >= 2.
5. Since the condition is false, it returns the element at index 1: `lst[1]` is `2`.
Thus, the output is `2`.
