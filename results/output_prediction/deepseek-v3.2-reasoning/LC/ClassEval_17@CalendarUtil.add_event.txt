[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.
1. The `add_event` method is called with `self.events` containing one event (New Year).
2. The method appends the given event to `self.events`.
3. The method has no explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`.
Therefore, the output of the function call is `None`.

    "output": null
