[THOUGHT]
We are simulating the `add_argument` method call. The method takes an argument `arg` and optional keyword arguments `required` and `arg_type`. It modifies the object's `required` set and `types` dictionary but does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`). Given the input:

- `self.required` is an empty set (represented as `"set()"` in the input JSON, but we treat it as an empty set).
- `self.types` initially contains `{"name": "<class 'str'>", "age": "<class 'int'>"}`.
- The method is called with `arg="age"`, `required=False`, and `arg_type="<class 'int'>"`.

Since `required` is `False`, the `if required:` condition is false, so `self.required` remains unchanged. Then, `self.types["age"]` is set to `"<class 'int'>"`, but it already has that value, so no effective change. The method returns `None`. Therefore, the output of the function call is `None`.
