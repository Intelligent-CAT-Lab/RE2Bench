[THOUGHT]
1. The function morsel_to_cookie is called with a morsel dictionary (or Morsel object) as argument. The input morsel has fields: expires="woops", path="", comment="", domain="", max-age="", secure="", httponly="", version="", samesite="". We note that the morsel is missing 'key' and 'value', but the function requires morsel.key and morsel.value. However, for simulation, we might assume they are empty strings if not provided. But even so, the function will fail at parsing expires.

2. The function first checks morsel['max-age']. Here it is an empty string, which is falsy, so it skips the max-age block.

3. Then it checks morsel['expires'], which is "woops" (non-empty string), so it enters the elif block.

4. In the elif block, it tries to parse "woops" with time.strptime using format '%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT'. This will raise a ValueError because "woops" does not match the format.

5. Therefore, the function morsel_to_cookie will raise a ValueError and not return a cookie object.

6. Hence, the output of the function is not a normal return value but an exception.
