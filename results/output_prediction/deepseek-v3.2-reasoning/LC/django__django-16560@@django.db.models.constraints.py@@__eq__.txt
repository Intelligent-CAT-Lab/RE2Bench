[THOUGHT]
1. We need to simulate the `__eq__` method of CheckConstraint with given inputs.
2. The method first checks if `other` is an instance of CheckConstraint.
3. In the input, `self` is a CheckConstraint object with attributes as shown.
4. The `other` in args is also a dictionary that looks like it could be a CheckConstraint with same attributes.
5. However, looking at the code: `isinstance(other, CheckConstraint)`. The `other` parameter passed is the value from input args, which is a dictionary, not a CheckConstraint instance.
6. Therefore, the isinstance check will return False.
7. Since isinstance returns False, the method will return `super().__eq__(other)`.
8. Without knowing the exact superclass implementation, but typically `object.__eq__` compares identity.
9. Since `other` is a dictionary and `self` is a CheckConstraint instance, they are different objects/types, so equality would be False.
10. Thus the output should be `False`.
