[THOUGHT]
The function `withdraw_resume` attempts to remove the given resume from the list `self.resumes`. However, `self.resumes` is an empty list, and the resume to remove is not present. The `list.remove()` method raises a `ValueError` when the item is not found. Therefore, the function call does not complete normally and no value is returned. If we consider the return value in case of successful execution, it would be `None`. Given the ambiguity, we assume the output is the return value, which is `null` (JSON equivalent of `None`), even though an exception is raised in this specific input.
