[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `maximum(arr, k)`. The function sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order and returns the last `k` elements (the `k` largest elements). If `k` is 0, it returns an empty list.

The input specifies:
- `arr = [-4, 4]`
- `k = 2`

Step-by-step simulation:
1. Check if `k == 0`. Since `k = 2`, we skip the condition.
2. `arr.sort()` sorts the list in place. The list becomes `[-4, 4]` (already sorted in ascending order, so no change).
3. `ans = arr[-k:]` computes the slice starting from index `-k` to the end. With `k=2`, `arr[-2:]` returns the last two elements, which is the entire list `[-4, 4]`.
4. The function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.

Thus, the output is the list `[-4, 4]`.
