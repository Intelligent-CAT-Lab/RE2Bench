[THOUGHT]
1. The method `get_topmost_subplotspec` is called on the instance of `SubplotSpec` provided in the input.
2. It first calls `self.get_gridspec()`, which returns `self._gridspec`. According to the input, `self._gridspec` is the string `"GridSpec(1, 1)"`.
3. It then checks if this returned object has an attribute `get_topmost_subplotspec` using `hasattr(gridspec, 'get_topmost_subplotspec')`. Since `gridspec` is a string, it does not have this method, so `hasattr` returns `False`.
4. Therefore, the method returns `self`, which is the original instance.
5. The output should represent this instance. Since the input represents the instance as a dictionary with keys `_gridspec`, `num1`, and `_num2`, we use the same representation for the output.
