[THOUGHT]
1. The method `as_content_primitive` is defined in the `Expr` class and takes two parameters: `radical` (default False) and `clear` (default True). In this call, `radical` is set to False and `clear` is set to False.
2. The method returns `(S.One, self)`. Here, `S.One` is the SymPy singleton representing the integer 1.
3. The `self` object is provided in the input as a dictionary: `{"nargs": "{1}"}`. The method does not use any attributes of `self` and simply returns it as the second element.
4. Therefore, the output of the method is a tuple: (1, self). In JSON, we represent the tuple as a list and the self object as the given dictionary.
