[THOUGHT]
1. The function `precision_recall_curve` is called with arguments: y_true=None, probas_pred=None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None.
2. The function calls `_binary_clf_curve` with these arguments.
3. `_binary_clf_curve` calls `type_of_target(y_true)` with y_true=None.
4. `type_of_target` checks if the input is array-like. None is not array-like, so it raises a ValueError with the message: "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None".
5. Therefore, `precision_recall_curve` does not complete and raises this ValueError.
