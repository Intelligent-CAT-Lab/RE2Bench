[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of `extract_all` step by step.
1. The method is called with `self.file_name = ""` and `output_path = ""`.
2. It enters the `try` block and attempts to create a `zipfile.ZipFile` object with `file_name=""` in read mode.
3. Opening a file with an empty string as the filename will raise an exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError` or a `zipfile.BadZipFile` error).
4. The `except` clause catches any exception and returns `False`.
5. Therefore, the output of the method is `False`.
