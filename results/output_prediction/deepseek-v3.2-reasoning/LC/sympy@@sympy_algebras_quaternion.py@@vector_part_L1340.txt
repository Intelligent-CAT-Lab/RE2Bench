[THOUGHT]
Given the input, the self object is a Quaternion with _real_field=True and _norm=None. However, the components (args) are not provided. Assuming the quaternion was created with default parameters (all zeros), then self.args = (0,0,0,0). Then self.b = 0, self.c = 0, self.d = 0. The vector_part method returns Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 0). Therefore, the output is a Quaternion object with all components zero. In string representation, it is likely "Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 0)".
