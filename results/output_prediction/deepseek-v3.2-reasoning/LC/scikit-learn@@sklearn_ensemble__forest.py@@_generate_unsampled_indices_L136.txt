1. The function `_generate_unsampled_indices` is called with `random_state=209652396`, `n_samples=150`, and `n_samples_bootstrap=150`.
2. It calls `_generate_sample_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap)`, which generates an array of 150 random integers between 0 and 149 (inclusive) using a random state initialized with seed 209652396.
3. Using `np.bincount`, we count occurrences of each index (0-149) in the generated sample indices.
4. We then find indices where the count is zero (unsampled).
5. The output is a numpy array of these unsampled indices.
6. To determine the exact unsampled indices, we need to compute the random numbers. Using the given seed, we can simulate:
   - Initialize a random state with seed 209652396.
   - Generate 150 integers in [0, 150) using `randint`.
   - Compute bincounts and unsampled indices.
7. Let's simulate this step-by-step (since we cannot run code, but we can reason that the output is deterministic given the seed). However, without actually generating the numbers, we cannot list them. Given the instructions, we must produce an output. Based on common random number generation with this seed and parameters, we can expect a specific set of unsampled indices. For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume the unsampled indices are as computed below (we'll simulate using a Python interpreter in mind, but note: this is a hypothetical simulation since we cannot execute here. In reality, one would run the code to get the exact list).
   Actually, we can note that with n_samples_bootstrap = n_samples, the sampling is with replacement, so some indices may be missing. The exact list depends on the random generation. Since we cannot compute without an interpreter, we will provide a placeholder list. However, given the example, we are expected to provide the exact output. Let's assume we ran the code and obtained the unsampled indices as follows (this is a hypothetical example, not the actual output):
   For instance, unsampled indices might be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...] but this is arbitrary.
   To be accurate, we should compute. Since we cannot, we will output an empty list as a placeholder, but that is not correct. However, the problem demands a specific output.
   Alternatively, we can derive the exact list by using the fact that the random number generator is deterministic. But without running the code, we cannot know.
   Given the constraints, we will provide the process and then output an example of what the structure would look like with a dummy list. But note: the example in the problem had a specific answer.
   Since we must fill the output, and we cannot compute it here, we will output an empty list to indicate that we cannot determine without running the code.
8. However, the problem expects a prediction. We must make a prediction based on the given inputs. Since the random state is fixed, the output is fixed. We can try to reason about the distribution: with 150 samples drawn with replacement from 150, the expected number of unsampled indices is 150 * (1 - 1/150)^150 ≈ 150 * 0.367 ≈ 55. So we expect about 55 unsampled indices. But we cannot list them.
9. Given the above, we will output the unsampled indices as a list of integers. Since we cannot compute exactly, we will provide a placeholder list of integers from 0 to 54 (55 indices) as an example, but this is not the correct answer. The correct answer requires running the code.
   Actually, the problem likely expects the exact output. Without the ability to run the code, we cannot provide it. So we will output an empty list and note that in a real scenario we would compute it.

Given the instructions, I will output the process and then output an empty list.
