[THOUGHT]
1. The function `dup_abs` is called with arguments `f=[2]` and `K="ZZ"`.
2. The function returns a list comprehension: `[K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]`.
3. For `f=[2]`, there is one coefficient: `2`.
4. `K.abs(2)` must be interpreted. In the context of sympy, `"ZZ"` represents the integer domain, and its `abs` method returns the absolute value. Since `2` is positive, `abs(2)` is `2`.
5. Therefore, the output of the function is `[2]`.
