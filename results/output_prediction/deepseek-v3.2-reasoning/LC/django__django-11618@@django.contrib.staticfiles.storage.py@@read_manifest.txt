[THOUGHT]
1. The method `read_manifest` attempts to open the file named by `self.manifest_name` (which is 'staticfiles.json') in the storage.
2. It uses `self.open(self.manifest_name)` to open the file. The `open` method is defined in the parent class `Storage` and is implemented by `FileSystemStorage._open`, which uses `self.path(name)` to get the full filesystem path.
3. Given the `self` object in the input, `self.location` is "/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr". Therefore, the full path for the manifest file is `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr/staticfiles.json`.
4. There is no information in the input that this file exists (e.g., it's not listed in `hashed_files`). The function catches `FileNotFoundError` and returns `None` in that case.
5. Therefore, `read_manifest` will return `None`.
