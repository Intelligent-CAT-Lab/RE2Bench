[THOUGHT]
We are given a function `f(nums)` that performs a loop `len(nums) - 1` times, each time reversing the list in place. The input list is `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`, which has length 7. Thus, `len(nums) - 1 = 6`, so the loop runs 6 times. Each iteration calls `nums.reverse()`. Reversing a list twice returns it to its original order. Since 6 is an even number, after 6 reversals the list will be in its original order. We can verify: 
- Start: [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]
- After 1st reverse: [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]
- After 2nd reverse: [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3] (back to original)
- After 3rd: same as 1st, after 4th: original, after 5th: reversed, after 6th: original.
Thus, the function returns the original list unchanged.
