[THOUGHT]
The function `clean_non_binary_chars` modifies `self.binary_string` by filtering out characters that are not '0' or '1'. However, it does not have a return statement, so when called, it returns `None`. Given the input binary string contains only '0' and '1' characters, filtering leaves it unchanged, but the method still returns `None`.
