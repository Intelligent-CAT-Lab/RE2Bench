[THOUGHT]
We are given a BinaryDataProcessor instance with binary_string = "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111". The method calculate_binary_info counts zeros and ones, computes their proportions, and returns a dictionary with keys 'Zeroes', 'Ones', and 'Bit length'. First, we assume clean_non_binary_chars does not change the string since it consists only of '0' and '1'. We count the number of '0's: the string has length 36, and by manual counting we find 16 zeros. Thus ones count = 36 - 16 = 20. Zeroes percentage = 16/36 = 4/9 ≈ 0.444444..., Ones percentage = 20/36 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555555..., Bit length = 36. So the output dictionary will have these values.
