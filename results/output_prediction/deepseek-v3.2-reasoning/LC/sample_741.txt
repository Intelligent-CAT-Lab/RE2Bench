[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` (a list) and `p` (an integer).
2. Given: `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` and `p = 6`.
3. Compute `prev_p = p - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`.
4. Check if `prev_p < 0`. Since `5` is not less than `0`, we do not change `prev_p`.
5. Return `nums[prev_p]` which is `nums[5]`.
6. The list `nums` has indices 0 to 7: index 0 = 6, index 1 = 8, index 2 = 2, index 3 = 5, index 4 = 3, index 5 = 1, index 6 = 9, index 7 = 7.
7. Therefore, `nums[5] = 1`.

Thus the output is 1.
