[THOUGHT]
We are given the BankAccount class with a deposit method. The input specifies:
- self.balance = 0
- amount = 300

Steps:
1. The deposit method is called with amount=300.
2. The method checks if amount < 0: 300 is not less than 0, so no exception.
3. It adds amount to self.balance: self.balance becomes 0 + 300 = 300.
4. It returns self.balance, which is 300.

Therefore, the output is 300.
