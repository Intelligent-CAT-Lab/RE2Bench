[THOUGHT]
We are given a function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` that returns a boolean: `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`. The input specifies that `n` is 10. So we compute:
- `10 % 2` equals 0, so `0 == 0` is True.
- `10 >= 8` is True.
- The logical AND of True and True is True.
Therefore, the function returns True. In JSON, booleans are represented as lowercase true/false.
