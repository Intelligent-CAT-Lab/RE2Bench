[THOUGHT]
We are given a ShoppingCart instance with items containing "apple" with price 1 and quantity 4. The method remove_item is called with args item="apple" and no kwargs, so quantity defaults to 1. The method checks if "apple" is in self.items, which is true, so it subtracts 1 from self.items["apple"]["quantity"], making it 3. The method does not have a return statement, so it returns None. Therefore, the output of the function call is None.
