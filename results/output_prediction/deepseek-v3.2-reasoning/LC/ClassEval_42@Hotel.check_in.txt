[THOUGHT]
We are given the Hotel class and its check_in method. The method takes room_type, room_number, and name as arguments. The current state of the object is:
- name: "Test Hotel"
- available_rooms: {"single": 1, "double": 2}
- booked_rooms: {"single": {}}
The arguments are: room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1".

We simulate the method step by step:
1. Check if room_type ("single") is in self.booked_rooms.keys(). self.booked_rooms has key "single", so condition is False, we do not return False.
2. Check if name ("guest 1") is in self.booked_rooms[room_type] (which is {}). The dictionary is empty, so condition is False, we do not enter the subsequent if-elif-else block.
The method then reaches the end without encountering a return statement, so it implicitly returns None.

Therefore, the output is None, which corresponds to null in JSON.
