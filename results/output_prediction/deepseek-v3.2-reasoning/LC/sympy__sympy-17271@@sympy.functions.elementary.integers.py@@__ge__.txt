[THOUGHT]
1. We are simulating the `__ge__` method of the `ceiling` class. The input provides `self` as an instance with an attribute `nargs` (an empty dictionary) and `other` as the string "x".
2. The method first checks if `self.args[0] == other` and `other.is_real`. Since `self.args` is not provided, we assume it is not equal to "x". Additionally, `other` is a string, which does not have an `is_real` attribute, so this condition fails.
3. Next, it checks if `other is S.NegativeInfinity` and `self.is_real`. The string "x" is not `S.NegativeInfinity`, so this also fails.
4. Therefore, the method returns `Ge(self, other, evaluate=False)`, which is an unevaluated relational object.
5. The output should be this object. Since we cannot determine the exact representation without knowing `self.args`, we represent it as a generic string.

{
    "output": "Ge(ceiling(), x, evaluate=False)"
