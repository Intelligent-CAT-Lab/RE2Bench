[THOUGHT]
1. The input rv is the string "cos(phi)**2". We interpret it as a SymPy expression: Pow(cos(phi), 2).
2. The function TR111 uses bottom_up to apply a function f to each node from bottom up.
3. For the expression cos(phi)**2:
   - The base is cos(phi), which is a cos function with argument phi.
   - The exponent is 2.
4. bottom_up first processes the exponent 2 (a number). Since it has no args and atoms=False, f is not applied to it.
5. Then it processes the argument phi (a Symbol). Similarly, f is not applied.
6. Then it processes cos(phi). f is applied: since cos(phi) is not a Pow, f returns it unchanged.
7. Then it processes the Pow node. f checks: isinstance(rv, Pow) is true. Then it checks: rv.base.is_positive or (rv.exp.is_integer and rv.exp.is_negative). For cos(phi), is_positive is unknown (False). rv.exp is 2, which is integer but not negative. So the condition is false. Therefore, the if condition in f is: if not (true and false) => if not false => true. So it enters the if block and returns rv unchanged.
8. Thus, TR111 returns the original expression cos(phi)**2.
9. The output should be the string representation of the result, which is "cos(phi)**2".
