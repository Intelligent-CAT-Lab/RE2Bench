[THOUGHT]
The function `change_order_status` checks if `order_id` is in `self.orders`. In the input, `self.orders` has a key `"1"` (string), but `order_id` is provided as the integer `1`. Since `1` (int) is not equal to `"1"` (str), the condition `order_id in self.orders` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the else branch executes and returns `False`. The function does not modify any state in this case.
