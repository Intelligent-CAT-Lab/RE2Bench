Let's simulate the execution of the function step by step.

The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring, and returns a new list containing only those strings that contain the substring.

Given:
- `strings`: ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]
- `substring`: "run"

We iterate over each string in the list and check if "run" is a substring of that string.

1. For "grunt": 
   - Check if "run" is in "grunt". 
   - "grunt" contains the sequence 'r', 'u', 'n' starting at index 1, so "run" is a substring. 
   - Include "grunt".

2. For "trumpet":
   - Check if "run" is in "trumpet".
   - "trumpet" contains 'r' and 'u' but the next character is 'm', not 'n', so "run" is not present.
   - Exclude "trumpet".

3. For "prune":
   - Check if "run" is in "prune".
   - "prune" contains the sequence 'r', 'u', 'n' starting at index 1, so "run" is a substring.
   - Include "prune".

4. For "gruesome":
   - Check if "run" is in "gruesome".
   - "gruesome" contains 'r' and 'u' but the next character is 'e', not 'n', so "run" is not present.
   - Exclude "gruesome".

Thus, the filtered list is ["grunt", "prune"].

Therefore, the output is `["grunt", "prune"]`.
