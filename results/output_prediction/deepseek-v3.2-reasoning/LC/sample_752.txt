[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f(s, amount) that returns (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s. The input is s="abc" and amount=8. 
1. Compute len(s): len("abc") = 3.
2. Compute amount - len(s): 8 - 3 = 5.
3. Multiply 'z' by that number: 5 * 'z' = 'zzzzz'.
4. Concatenate with s: 'zzzzz' + "abc" = "zzzzzabc".
Thus, the output is "zzzzzabc".
