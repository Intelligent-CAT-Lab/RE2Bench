[THOUGHT]
Given the Python code and the input, I need to simulate execution. The input JSON shows `"input": "\"3 4 7 8\""`, which after parsing gives the string `"3 4 7 8"` (including quotes). However, this would cause `int()` conversion to fail. Given the context, it's more likely the intended input is `3 4 7 8` (without quotes), as the code processes four integers. I'll assume the input line is `3 4 7 8`. Then:

1. `anti, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` assigns `anti = 3, b = 4, c = 7, d = 8`.
2. `l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4`.
3. `m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4`.
4. Check conditions:
   - `anti == c` is `3 == 7` → false.
   - `b == d` is `4 == 8` → false.
   - `l != m` is `4 != 4` → false.
5. Execute the `else` branch: `print(anti, d, c, b)` → prints `3 8 7 4`.

Thus, the output is `3 8 7 4`.
