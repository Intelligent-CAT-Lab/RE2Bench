[THOUGHT]
We are given a Python code snippet and an input. The code reads a line from input, splits it into two parts `a` and `b`, then transforms `b` by removing the character at index 1 (the decimal point) and converting both to integers. Finally, it prints `(a * b) // 100`.

The input is provided as a JSON string: `{"input": "\"776013196293085 2.60\""}`. This JSON indicates that the input string contains double quotes around the numbers. However, if taken literally, this would cause a `ValueError` when converting `a` to an integer because it starts with a quote. Since the problem expects a valid output, we assume the intended input is `776013196293085 2.60` without the surrounding quotes.

Proceeding with that assumption:

1. `input()` returns `"776013196293085 2.60"` (without extra quotes).
2. `a, b = input().split()` yields `a = "776013196293085"` and `b = "2.60"`.
3. `b = b[0] + b[2:]`: `b[0]` is `'2'`, `b[2:]` is `'60'` (from index 2 to end), so `b` becomes `"260"`.
4. `a = int(a)` converts to `776013196293085`.
5. `b = int(b)` converts to `260`.
6. `a * b` is `776013196293085 * 260 = 201763431036202100`.
7. `a * b // 100` is `201763431036202100 // 100 = 2017634310362021`.

Thus, the output is `2017634310362021`.
