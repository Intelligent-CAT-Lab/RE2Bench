[THOUGHT]
1. The function `setup(app)` takes a Sphinx application instance as input
2. It calls `app.add_transform()` 5 times to register different transforms
3. The function returns a dictionary with three keys: 'version', 'parallel_read_safe', and 'parallel_write_safe'
4. The return values are hardcoded in the function:
   - 'version' is set to 'builtin'
   - 'parallel_read_safe' is set to True  
   - 'parallel_write_safe' is set to True
5. The input contains an app parameter that appears to be a SphinxTestApp instance, but this doesn't affect the return value
6. The transforms being added don't change the return value either
7. Therefore, the output will be the fixed dictionary regardless of the specific app instance
