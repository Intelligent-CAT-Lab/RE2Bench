[THOUGHT]
The code reads a line of input, splits it into four integers, and computes the overlap length of two intervals [a, b] and [c, d]. The formula `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))` computes the length of the intersection, or 0 if they do not overlap.

Given the input `0 33 66 99`, we have:
- a = 0, b = 33, c = 66, d = 99.
- `min(b, d) = min(33, 99) = 33`
- `max(a, c) = max(0, 66) = 66`
- `min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 33 - 66 = -33`
- `max(0, -33) = 0`

Thus, the output is `0`.
