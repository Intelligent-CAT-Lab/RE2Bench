[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_coeff_isneg` takes an argument `a` which is expected to be a SymPy expression.
2. Given input: `a` is the string `"cos(2*phi)/2"`. However, in context, this likely represents a SymPy expression equivalent to `cos(2*phi)/2`.
3. The expression `cos(2*phi)/2` in SymPy is a multiplication: `cos(2*phi) * (1/2)`, so it is a `Mul` object.
4. The function first checks `a.is_MatMul`. This is false for a `Mul`.
5. It then checks `a.is_Mul`. This is true, so `a` is set to `a.args[0]`. In a `Mul`, the arguments are ordered canonically; typically the numeric coefficient comes first. Thus, `a.args[0]` is likely `1/2` (a `Rational` number).
6. Then the function returns `a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative`. `1/2` is a number but not negative, so the result is `False`.
7. Even if the order were reversed and `a.args[0]` were `cos(2*phi)`, that is not a number, so the result would still be `False`.
8. Therefore, the output of `_coeff_isneg` is `False`.
