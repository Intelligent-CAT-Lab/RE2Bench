[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_cmp_name` compares two types `x` and `y` based on their names and possibly a predefined ordering.
2. Given input: `x` is the class `sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit` and `y` is the class `sympy.core.numbers.Pi`.
3. Extract `__name__` attributes: `n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"`, `n2 = "Pi"`.
4. Since `n1 != n2`, proceed.
5. Check if `y` (Pi) is a subclass of `Basic`. In SymPy, both are subclasses of `Basic`, so condition is false.
6. The variable `ordering_of_classes` is not defined in the provided context, so assume it is a list that likely does not include these constant classes.
7. Both `"ImaginaryUnit"` and `"Pi"` are probably not in `ordering_of_classes`, so both indices become `UNKNOWN`.
8. With both `UNKNOWN`, compare lexicographically: `"ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi"`, so `(n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)` equals `(False) - (True)` = `0 - 1` = `-1`.
9. Therefore, the function returns `-1`.
