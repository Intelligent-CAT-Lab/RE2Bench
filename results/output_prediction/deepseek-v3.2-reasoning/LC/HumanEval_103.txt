Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `rounded_avg` is called with `n=185` and `m=546`.
2. First, check if `m < n`: `546 < 185` is false, so we do not return -1.
3. Initialize `summation = 0`.
4. Loop `i` from `n` to `m` inclusive: `i` goes from 185 to 546.
   - The number of terms is `m - n + 1 = 546 - 185 + 1 = 362`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (first + last) * number_of_terms / 2 = (185 + 546) * 362 / 2 = 731 * 181 = 132311`.
5. Compute the average: `summation / (m - n + 1) = 132311 / 362 = 365.5`.
6. Apply `round(365.5)`. In Python, `round` uses bankers' rounding: when the fractional part is exactly 0.5, it rounds to the nearest even integer. Since 365 is odd, it rounds up to 366.
7. Convert the result to binary using `bin(366)`. The binary representation of 366 is `'0b101101110'`.
8. The function returns this string.

Therefore, the output is `"0b101101110"`.
