[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.

1. The function `any_int` takes three arguments: x, y, z.
2. The input provides x=2, y=1, z=1.
3. First, check if all are integers using `isinstance`. 2, 1, and 1 are integers, so the condition is True.
4. Next, check if any of the sums equals the third:
   - x + y = 2 + 1 = 3. Compare to z (1): 3 == 1 → False.
   - x + z = 2 + 1 = 3. Compare to y (1): 3 == 1 → False.
   - y + z = 1 + 1 = 2. Compare to x (2): 2 == 2 → True.
   Since one condition is True, the inner if returns True.
5. Therefore, the function returns True.
