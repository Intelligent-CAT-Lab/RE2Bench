[THOUGHT]
The function f(text, ch) returns the count of character ch in the string text.
Given inputs: text = "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!", ch = " ".
We need to count the number of spaces in the text.
The text contains spaces between each word: after "This", "be", "Pirate's", "Speak", and "for". That's 5 spaces.
Thus, text.count(" ") = 5.
