[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f(array, index). It first checks if index is negative. If it is, it adjusts index to len(array) + index, effectively converting a negative index to a non-negative one. Then it returns the element of array at that index.

The input provides: array = [1] and index = 0. Since index is 0, which is not less than 0, the condition is false, so index remains 0. Then we return array[0], which is 1.

Thus, the output is 1.
