[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The input provided is the string "9". The code reads it via `input()` and converts it to an integer: `n = 9`.
2. The `while` loop condition checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`). Since `9 % 2` equals 1, the condition is false, so the loop is skipped entirely.
3. Next, the code checks `if n == 1`. At this point, `n` is still 9, so the condition is false, and the `else` block executes.
4. The `else` block prints `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the program is "NO".
