[THOUGHT]
Given the input, the Permutation object has `_size`: 7 and both `_array_form` and `_cyclic_form` are null. This suggests it is the identity permutation of size 7. In the `__pow__` method, `n` is converted to int (-2). The method accesses `self.array_form`, which, when `_array_form` is None, will be computed as the identity array form `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Then `_af_pow` is called with this array form and exponent -2. For the identity permutation, any integer power (including negative) yields the identity permutation. Thus, the result is a new Permutation object with `_array_form` = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `_size` = 7.
