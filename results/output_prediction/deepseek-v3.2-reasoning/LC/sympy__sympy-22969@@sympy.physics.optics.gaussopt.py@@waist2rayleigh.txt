[THOUGHT]
1. The function `waist2rayleigh` takes arguments `w`, `wavelen`, and `n` (default 1).
2. Input values: `w="w_0"`, `wavelen="l"`, `n="1"`. These are strings.
3. The function sympifies `w` and `wavelen`, converting them to SymPy symbols `w_0` and `l`.
4. Although `n` is not explicitly sympified in the given code, for the computation to proceed symbolically (and based on typical SymPy usage), we assume `n` is effectively converted to the integer 1 (via `sympify("1")` or by being the default integer).
5. The expression computed is `w**2 * n * pi / wavelen = (w_0)**2 * 1 * pi / l = pi * w_0**2 / l`.
6. The output is the SymPy expression `pi*w_0**2/l`, represented as a string.
