[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `add_heading` with the given input. The method attempts to open an existing Word document at `self.file_path` ("test_example.docx"), add a heading with the provided text ("Test Heading 5") at the default level 1, save the document, and return `True`. If any exception occurs (such as the file not existing), it returns `False`. Since we are not given any information about the existence of the file, and the method does not create a new document, it is likely that the file does not exist, causing an exception. Therefore, the method returns `False`.
