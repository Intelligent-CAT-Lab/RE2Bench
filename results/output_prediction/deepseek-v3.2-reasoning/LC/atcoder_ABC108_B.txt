[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the given Python code with the provided input. The code reads four integers from input, computes some values, and prints four numbers.

The input is given as JSON: `{"input": "\"100 100 100 99\""}`. The escaped double quotes suggest that the actual input string might be `"100 100 100 99"` including the quotes. However, if that were the case, `split()` would produce tokens like `['"100', '100', '100', '99"']`, and converting these to integers would fail because of the quotes. Since the problem expects an output, it's more likely that the intended input is `100 100 100 99` without quotes. Perhaps the JSON representation is misleading.

Assuming the input string is `100 100 100 99`, we proceed:

- `x1, y1, x2, y2 = 100, 100, 100, 99`
- `a = x2 - x1 = 100 - 100 = 0`
- `b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1`
- Then compute:
  - `x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
  - `y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99`
  - `x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
  - `y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100`
- The `print` statement outputs these four numbers separated by spaces: `101 99 101 100`.

Thus, the output should be the string `"101 99 101 100"`.

If the input actually included quotes, the program would crash, which is unlikely for a problem asking for output. Therefore, we go with the interpretation that the input is `100 100 100 99`.
