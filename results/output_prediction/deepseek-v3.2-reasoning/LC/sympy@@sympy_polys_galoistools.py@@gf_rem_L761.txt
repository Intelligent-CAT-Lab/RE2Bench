[THOUGHT]
We need to compute `gf_rem(f, g, p, K)`, which calls `gf_div(f, g, p, K)` and returns the remainder. The inputs are:
- f = [2, 0] (polynomial 2x + 0, degree 1)
- g = [1, 0, 1] (polynomial x^2 + 0x + 1, degree 2)
- p = 3 (modulo 3)
- K = "ZZ" (integer domain)

In `gf_div`, the degrees of f and g are compared: df = 1, dg = 2. Since df < dg, the function returns `([], f)`. Thus, the remainder is f itself, [2, 0]. No further calculations are needed because the division algorithm short-circuits when the dividend's degree is less than the divisor's degree.
