[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.
1. The function `f` takes `nums`, `idx`, and `added`.
2. In this call, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, `idx = 2`, `added = 3`.
3. The line `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` performs slice assignment. The slice `nums[2:2]` is an empty slice at index 2, meaning it selects no elements.
4. Assigning a tuple `(3,)` to this empty slice inserts the value `3` at index 2, shifting elements from index 2 onward to the right.
5. The list becomes: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.
6. The function returns this modified list.
Thus, the output is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.
