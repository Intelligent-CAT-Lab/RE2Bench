[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of `change_base(x=4, base=5)`. The function converts the integer x to its representation in the given base. The algorithm: while x > 0, compute x % base, prepend that digit to the result string, then update x to x // base. For x=4 and base=5, the process is:
1. x=4, base=5: x % base = 4, result becomes '4', x becomes 4 // 5 = 0.
2. Loop ends because x is not > 0.
The function returns '4'. So the output is the string "4".
