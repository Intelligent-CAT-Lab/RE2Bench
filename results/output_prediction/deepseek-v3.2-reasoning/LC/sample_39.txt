[THOUGHT]
We are given the function f(array, elem). It checks if elem is in array. If yes, it returns the index of elem in array using array.index(elem). If not, it returns -1.

Given inputs: array = [6, 2, 7, 1] and elem = 6.
Step 1: Check if 6 is in [6, 2, 7, 1]. Yes, it is present.
Step 2: array.index(6) returns the first index where 6 appears. Since 6 is at index 0 (the first element), the return value is 0.
Thus, the output of the function is 0.
