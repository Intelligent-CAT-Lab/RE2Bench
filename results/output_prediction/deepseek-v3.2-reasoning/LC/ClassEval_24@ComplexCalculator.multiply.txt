[THOUGHT]
We are given the multiply method of ComplexCalculator. The input provides c1 and c2 as strings "(-1-2j)" and "(-3-4j)". Since the method expects complex numbers (with .real and .imag attributes), we interpret these strings as complex numbers. Compute product:
c1 = complex(-1-2j) = -1-2j
c2 = complex(-3-4j) = -3-4j
Real part: (-1)*(-3) - (-2)*(-4) = 3 - 8 = -5.
Imaginary part: (-1)*(-4) + (-2)*(-3) = 4 + 6 = 10.
Thus product = -5 + 10j, which as a complex number is represented as (-5+10j).
