[THOUGHT]
1. We need to simulate the `__eq__` method of the Django Model class with the given inputs.
2. The `__eq__` method checks:
   - If `other` is not an instance of `Model`, return `NotImplemented`. But in the input, `other` is provided as a dictionary representing a model instance state. However, since we're simulating and the method expects a Model instance, we'll assume both are Model instances.
   - Compare `self._meta.concrete_model` and `other._meta.concrete_model`. The input doesn't include `_meta`, but we can assume both are the same concrete model because they have identical structure and `id`.
   - Get `self.pk` via `_get_pk_val`. In the input, `self` has `id: 1`, so `self.pk` should be 1 (assuming `id` is the primary key).
   - If `self.pk` is `None`, return `self is other`. Here, `self.pk` is 1 (not `None`).
   - Compare `self.pk` and `other.pk`: both are 1, so they are equal.
3. Therefore, the method returns `True`.
