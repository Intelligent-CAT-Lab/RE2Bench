[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `derivative` takes a list `xs` as input.
2. It computes `[i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)]`. For `xs = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]`, `enumerate(xs)` gives: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,4).
   - 0*3 = 0
   - 1*2 = 2
   - 2*1 = 2
   - 3*0 = 0
   - 4*4 = 16
   So the list is `[0, 2, 2, 0, 16]`.
3. Then it applies `[1:]` to slice from index 1 onward, resulting in `[2, 2, 0, 16]`.
4. The output is this list.
