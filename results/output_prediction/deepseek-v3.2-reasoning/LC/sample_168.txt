[THOUGHT]
We simulate the function step by step.
Given text="spain", new_value="b", index=4.
text[4] is 'n' because indexing starts at 0: 's'->0, 'p'->1, 'a'->2, 'i'->3, 'n'->4.
Then key = text.maketrans('n', 'b') creates a translation table that maps 'n' to 'b'.
Then text.translate(key) applies this translation to "spain", so every 'n' becomes 'b'. Since "spain" contains only one 'n' at the end, it becomes "spaib".
Thus, the function returns "spaib".
