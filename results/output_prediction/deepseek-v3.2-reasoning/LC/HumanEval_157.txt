[THOUGHT]
We are given a Python function `right_angle_triangle` that checks whether a triangle with sides a, b, c is a right-angled triangle. It does so by checking if the square of any one side equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Given inputs: a=10, b=6, c=8.

Step-by-step:
1. Compute squares:
   - a*a = 10*10 = 100
   - b*b = 6*6 = 36
   - c*c = 8*8 = 64

2. Check the conditions:
   - Condition 1: a*a == b*b + c*c → 100 == 36 + 64 → 100 == 100 → True
   Since the first condition is True, the whole expression evaluates to True (due to short-circuiting).

Thus, the function returns True.

The output should be a JSON object with key "output" and value true (boolean).
