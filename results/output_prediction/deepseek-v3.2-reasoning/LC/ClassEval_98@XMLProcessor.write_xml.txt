[THOUGHT]
The method write_xml attempts to create an ElementTree from self.root, which is None. This will raise an exception because ET.ElementTree expects an Element object. Additionally, the file_name is an empty string, which would cause further issues when writing. The try-except block catches any exception and returns False. Therefore, the output is False.
