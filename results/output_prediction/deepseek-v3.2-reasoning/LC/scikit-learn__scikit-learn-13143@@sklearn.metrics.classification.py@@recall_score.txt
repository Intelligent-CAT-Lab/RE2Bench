[THOUGHT]
I need to simulate the execution of the `recall_score` function with the given inputs. Looking at the input JSON:
- `self`: {} (empty, meaning the function is called standalone)
- `args`: {"y_true": null, "y_pred": null} - both are null/None
- `kwargs`: {"labels": null, "average": null} - both are null/None

The function signature is: `recall_score(y_true, y_pred, labels=None, pos_label=1, average='binary', sample_weight=None)`

From the input, `y_true` and `y_pred` are passed as null/None via args, and `labels` and `average` are also null/None via kwargs.

Step-by-step execution:
1. `recall_score` is called with `y_true=None`, `y_pred=None`, `labels=None`, `average=None`
2. Inside `recall_score`, it calls `precision_recall_fscore_support` with these parameters
3. Looking at `precision_recall_fscore_support`:
   - Checks if `average` is in allowed options: (None, 'micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 'samples') - `None` is allowed
   - Checks `beta` > 0 (default 1.0, so OK)
   - Calls `_check_targets(y_true, y_pred)` with both as None

4. In `_check_targets`:
   - Calls `check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred)` with both as None
   - `_num_samples(None)` will be called on each
   - `_num_samples` checks if input has `__len__` or `shape` attribute
   - `None` doesn't have `__len__`, `shape`, or `__array__`
   - So it raises: `TypeError('Expected sequence or array-like, got %s' % type(x))`

So the function will raise a TypeError when trying to process the None inputs. Since the function raises an exception, the output should reflect this error.

Looking at the output structure: `{"output": XXX}` - I need to output the error message.
