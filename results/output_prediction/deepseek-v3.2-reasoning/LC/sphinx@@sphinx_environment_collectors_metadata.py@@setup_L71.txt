[THOUGHT]
1. The function `setup` takes an argument `app` which is a Sphinx instance.
2. Inside `setup`, it calls `app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector)`. However, note that `MetadataCollector` is not defined in the provided code, but it's imported from somewhere else (assumed to be available).
3. The `add_env_collector` function logs and creates an instance of the collector, calling `enable(self)` on it. This doesn't affect the return value.
4. The `setup` function returns a fixed dictionary: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.
5. Given the input, `app` is a SphinxTestApp instance, but that doesn't change the return value.
6. Therefore, the output values are fixed: version = 'builtin', parallel_read_safe = True, parallel_write_safe = True.
