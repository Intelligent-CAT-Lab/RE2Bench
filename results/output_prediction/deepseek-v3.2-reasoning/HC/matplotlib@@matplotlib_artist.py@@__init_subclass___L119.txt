[THOUGHT]
1. The `__init_subclass__` method is called for the class provided in `args["cls"]`. 
2. First, it checks if `cls.draw` has the attribute `_supports_rasterization`. Since `cls` is a subclass of `Artist` and likely hasn't overridden `draw`, it inherits `Artist.draw`, which does not have `_supports_rasterization` initially. So, `cls.draw` is wrapped with `_prevent_rasterization`.
3. Next, it checks if `cls.set` has the attribute `_autogenerated_signature`. `cls` inherits `Artist.set`, which does not have this attribute because `_update_set_signature_and_docstring` hasn't been called on it yet. Therefore, the condition `not hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature')` is true, causing the method to return early without executing the remaining code.
4. Since the method returns early, the output is `None`.
