[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides `eq` as the string `"2 - 2*cos(phi)"`. However, `_mask_nc` expects a SymPy expression. We assume it is sympified to the expression `2 - 2*cos(phi)`.
2. `name` is `null`, so inside the function, `name` becomes `'mask'`.
3. The function defines a generator for dummy names (`'mask0'`, `'mask1'`, ...) and a local `Dummy` function that creates a Dummy symbol with the next name.
4. It sets `expr = eq`. For the expression `2 - 2*cos(phi)`, all symbols and functions are commutative, so `expr.is_commutative` is `True`.
5. Therefore, the function immediately returns `(eq, {}, [])`.
6. The output tuple consists of the original expression (`2 - 2*cos(phi)`), an empty dictionary, and an empty list.
7. To represent this in JSON, we use an array with three elements: the string representation of the expression (`"2 - 2*cos(phi)"`), an empty object (`{}`), and an empty array (`[]`).
