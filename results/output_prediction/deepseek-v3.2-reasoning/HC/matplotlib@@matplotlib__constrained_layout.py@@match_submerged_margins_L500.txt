[THOUGHT]
1. The function match_submerged_margins is called with layoutgrids and fig.
2. fig has no subfigs, so axsdone is empty.
3. fig.get_axes() returns two axes. Assuming both have a subplotspec and are in layout, axs is a list of these two axes.
4. For each axis in axs:
   - Its subplotspec's gridspec is present in layoutgrids (key "GridSpec(1, 2)" corresponds to the gridspec object), so the axis is not removed.
   - The colspan and rowspan of each subplotspec are of length 1 (since each axis occupies a single cell in the 1x2 grid), so no margin adjustments are performed.
5. The function returns axs, which is the list of the two axes.
