[THOUGHT]
1. The function `world_to_pixel_values` is called with no arguments (`args` and `kwargs` are empty). 
2. The first step computes `sliced_out_world_coords` by calling `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`. 
   - `self._pixel_keep` is given as a string "[0 1]", interpreted as a list [0,1], so `len(self._pixel_keep)` = 2.
3. `_pixel_to_world_values_all` requires `self._slices_pixel` to iterate over pixel dimensions. However, `self._slices_pixel` is null in the input, leading to a TypeError when trying to access its elements.
4. Even if we assume `self._slices_pixel` is properly initialized (e.g., `[slice(None), slice(None), 0]`), the function proceeds to the next step.
5. Then, `world_arrays` is empty, but the loop over `self._wcs.world_n_dim` (unknown, but assumed >=2) attempts to access elements from `world_arrays` for indices in `self._world_keep` ([0,1]), causing an IndexError.
6. Therefore, the function cannot execute successfully with the given input and will raise an exception (either TypeError or IndexError). No normal output is produced.
