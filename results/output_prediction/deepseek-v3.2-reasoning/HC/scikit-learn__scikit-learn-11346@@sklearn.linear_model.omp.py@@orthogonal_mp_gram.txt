[THOUGHT]
The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` is called with a 12x12 Gram matrix, a 12x1 Xy vector, `n_nonzero_coefs=1`, `tol=None`, `norms_squared=[5.44055527]`, and `copy_Xy=False`. Since `tol` is `None`, the algorithm selects exactly one atom based on the maximum absolute correlation. The initial `alpha` is set to `Xy`. The maximum absolute value in `Xy` is at index 1 (value 2.33249979). The algorithm computes the Cholesky factor for the selected atom (Gram[1,1]=1.0, so L[0,0]=1.0) and solves for `gamma = Xy[1] / L[0,0] = 2.33249979`. The output is a sparse coefficient vector of length 12 with all zeros except at index 1, which is 2.33249979. The function returns `np.squeeze(coef)`, which becomes a 1D array. The result is thus a list of 12 floats with one non-zero value at position 1.
