The FeatureUnion's `fit` method will raise a TypeError when trying to convert `self.transformer_list` (which is `None`) to a list. Since no valid transformers exist, the method cannot proceed, and the object state remains unchanged. The output will be the original input values.

[THOUGHT]
1. The `fit` method calls `self._parallel_func`.
2. `_parallel_func` starts with `self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)`.
3. Since `self.transformer_list` is `None`, this raises `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.
4. The exception propagates, and `fit` does not complete, leaving the object unchanged.
5. The output structure requires the object's attributes after the call, which remain as in the input.

Thus, the output values are the same as the input values.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "transformer_list": null,
    "n_jobs": null,
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "verbose": false
}
