The `_get_kernel_params` method starts by initializing `params` to `self.kernel_params`, which is `null` (None), so `params` becomes an empty dictionary `{}`. Since `self.kernel` is `"polynomial"` (not callable and not `'precomputed'`), it iterates over `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`. For the polynomial kernel, typical parameters are `'gamma'`, `'coef0'`, and `'degree'`. For each parameter, if the attribute on `self` is not `None`, it adds to `params`. Here, `self.gamma` is `null` (None), so it is not added. `self.coef0` is `0.1` and `self.degree` is `3.1`, both non-null, so they are added to `params`. The method then returns `params`. Therefore, the output dictionary contains `"coef0": 0.1` and `"degree": 3.1`.
