[THOUGHT]
1. The function `expand_log` is called with arguments: expr="log(2)", deep=True, force=False, factor=False.
2. Since `factor` is False, the code enters the `if` block and defines `_handleMul`. However, the `replace` call on `expr` uses a query that checks for `x.is_Mul`. The input expression "log(2)" is a string, but after sympification it becomes a `log` object, not a `Mul`. Therefore, the `replace` call finds no matches and leaves `expr` unchanged.
3. The function then returns `sympify(expr).expand(deep=deep, log=True, mul=False, power_exp=False, power_base=False, multinomial=False, basic=False, force=force, factor=factor)`.
4. `sympify("log(2)")` converts the string to a SymPy expression `log(2)`.
5. Expanding `log(2)` with `log=True` does not change it because there is no product or power to expand. The expression remains `log(2)`.
6. The output is a SymPy expression, which when represented as a string is "log(2)".
