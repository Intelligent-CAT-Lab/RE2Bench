The function `diophantine` solves the Diophantine equation `8*x*y + z**2 = 0`. The equation is a homogeneous ternary quadratic equation. The solver identifies the trivial solutions where either `x = 0` or `y = 0`, and a parametric family of nontrivial solutions. The output is a set of tuples representing these solutions in terms of integer parameters `t` and `u`.

[THOUGHT]
1. The equation is expanded and classified as a homogeneous ternary quadratic equation.
2. Since it is not of type 'general_sum_of_squares', `classify_diop` raises a `TypeError`, leading to factoring the equation.
3. The factorization yields a single factor, so `terms = [(8*x*y + z**2, 1)]`.
4. For this factor, `classify_diop` is called again, identifying the equation type as 'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'.
5. `diop_solve` is invoked, which calls `_diop_ternary_quadratic` to find a particular solution and then `_parametrize_ternary_quadratic` to generate the parametric solution.
6. The trivial solutions `(0, t, 0)` and `(t, 0, 0)` are included, along with the parametric solution `(t**2, -2*u**2, 4*t*u)`.
