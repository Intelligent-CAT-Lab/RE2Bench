[THOUGHT]
1. We are given the function `as_ordered_factors` with `self` = "w*z" (a Mul expression) and `order` = None.
2. Looking at the `as_ordered_factors` method in the Mul class:
   - It calls `self.args_cnc()` to get commutative (cpart) and non-commutative (ncpart) factors.
   - Then sorts cpart using each expression's `sort_key` method with the given `order`.
   - Returns the concatenation of sorted cpart and ncpart.
3. Since "w*z" is a multiplication of two symbols, both are commutative by default in sympy.
4. `args_cnc` will return: 
   - c = [w, z] (list of commutative factors)
   - nc = [] (empty list for non-commutative factors)
5. With `order=None`, the default sorting key for symbols is based on their string names. 
   - w has name "w", z has name "z".
   - Lexicographically, "w" comes before "z", so the order remains [w, z].
6. The output will be a list containing the two factors in order: [w, z].
7. In the output structure, we need to represent this as ["w", "z"].
