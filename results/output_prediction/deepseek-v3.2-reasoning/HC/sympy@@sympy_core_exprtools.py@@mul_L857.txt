[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides `self` and `other` as Term objects with coeff=1, numer=Factors({}), denom=Factors({}).
2. In `Term.mul`, compute coeff = 1 * 1 = 1.
3. Compute numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer). Both are empty Factors, so multiplication yields Factors({}) (assuming empty Factors represents 1, not zero).
4. Compute denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom), similarly yielding Factors({}).
5. Normalize numer and denom: numer.normal(denom) returns (Factors({}), Factors({})) since both are empty.
6. The resulting Term is Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({})).
7. The output is this Term object, which should be represented as a string similar to the input format.
