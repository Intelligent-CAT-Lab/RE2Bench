[THOUGHT]
1. The input represents a BezierSegment with `_cpoints` = [[0., -2.48451997]], `_N` = 1, `_d` = 2.
2. The `axis_aligned_extrema` method first computes `n = self.degree`. Since `degree` is defined as `_N - 1`, we have `n = 0`.
3. In the method, there is a check: `if n <= 1: return (np.array([]), np.array([]))`. Since `n=0`, the condition is true, so the method immediately returns a tuple of two empty arrays.
4. Therefore, the output is two empty arrays, which can be represented in JSON as two empty lists.
