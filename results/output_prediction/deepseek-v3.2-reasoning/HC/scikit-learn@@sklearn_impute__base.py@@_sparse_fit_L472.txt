[THOUGHT]
1. The input X is given as an empty list "[]". In the context of `_sparse_fit`, we interpret X as a sparse matrix with no non-zero entries and shape (0,5) because self.n_features_in_ is 5.
2. The function computes missing mask, which will be an empty sparse matrix.
3. For each of the 5 features, the column data is empty, and with strategy='mean', the computed statistic is NaN because there are no samples.
4. The function returns a numpy array of 5 NaN values.
