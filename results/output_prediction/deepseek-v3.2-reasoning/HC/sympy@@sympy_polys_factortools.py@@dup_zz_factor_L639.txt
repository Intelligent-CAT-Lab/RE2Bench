[THOUGHT]
The function `dup_zz_factor` is called with f = [1] and K = ZZ.
First, it checks GROUND_TYPES. Since it is not specified, we assume it is not 'flint' (or even if it were, the result would be the same).
In the non-flint branch:
1. Compute `cont, g = dup_primitive(f, K)`. For f = [1], dup_primitive returns (1, [1]).
2. n = dup_degree(g) = 0.
3. Since n <= 0, the function returns (cont, []) = (1, []).

Thus, the output is (1, []).
