[THOUGHT]
1. The expression is cos(phi)**2, which is a power with base = cos(phi) and exponent = 2.
2. In the method _eval_is_finite:
   - The exponent 2 is not negative, so skip the first if block.
   - Check base.is_finite: we assume cos(phi) is finite (since cosine is bounded) so c1 = True.
   - Check exp.is_finite: 2 is finite so c2 = True.
   - Since both are True, we check if exp.is_nonnegative (True) or fuzzy_not(base.is_zero). Since exp.is_nonnegative is True, the condition is True.
   - Therefore, the method returns True.
