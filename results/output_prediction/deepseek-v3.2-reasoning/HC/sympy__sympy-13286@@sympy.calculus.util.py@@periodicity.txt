[THOUGHT]
We need to predict the output of the `periodicity` function given the input. The input provides `f` as a string "csc(2*x) - sec(x)". The function `periodicity` expects a sympy expression and a symbol. Since the symbol is not explicitly provided in the input, we must infer it from the expression. The expression contains the variable `x`, so we assume the symbol is `x`. The function will compute the period of the expression `csc(2*x) - sec(x)`.

The period of `csc(2*x)` is π, and the period of `sec(x)` is 2π. The period of the combined expression is the least common multiple of the periods, which is 2π. The sympy representation of 2π is `2*pi`. The `periodicity` function should return this as a sympy expression. Therefore, the output should be the string representation "2*pi".
