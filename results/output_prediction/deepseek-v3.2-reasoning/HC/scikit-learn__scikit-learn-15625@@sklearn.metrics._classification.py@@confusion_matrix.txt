[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides y_true and y_pred as strings that represent arrays: "[0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]". I parse these into lists of integers: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] for both y_true and y_pred, each with 20 elements.

2. sample_weight is null, so it defaults to None, and normalize is not provided, so it defaults to None.

3. In confusion_matrix, first call _check_targets(y_true, y_pred):
   - Both arrays have the same length (20), so check_consistent_length passes.
   - type_of_target for both returns 'binary' since they contain only 0 and 1 with two unique values.
   - _check_targets returns ('binary', y_true_array, y_pred_array) with y_type='binary'.

4. Since y_type is 'binary', it proceeds without error.

5. labels is None, so labels = unique_labels(y_true, y_pred). Both arrays have unique labels [0, 1], so labels = [0, 1] (as a numpy array).

6. sample_weight is None, so it's set to an array of ones with length 20 and dtype np.int64.

7. n_labels = labels.size = 2.

8. label_to_ind = {0: 0, 1: 1}.

9. y_pred and y_true are mapped using label_to_ind: since all values are 0 or 1, they remain unchanged.

10. ind = np.logical_and(y_pred < n_labels, y_true < n_labels): n_labels=2, y_pred and y_true are 0 or 1, so ind is all True.

11. Thus, y_pred, y_true, and sample_weight are unchanged.

12. sample_weight.dtype is np.int64, so dtype = np.int64.

13. Construct the confusion matrix cm using coo_matrix with (sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred)), shape=(2,2). Since y_true and y_pred are identical:
    - For true label 0 (occurrences: 9 times), predicted as 0, so cm[0,0] = 9.
    - For true label 1 (occurrences: 11 times), predicted as 1, so cm[1,1] = 11.
    - Other entries are 0.
    Thus, cm = [[9, 0], [0, 11]].

14. normalize is None, so no normalization is applied, and cm is returned as is.

15. The output should be the confusion matrix in a JSON-serializable format, i.e., a list of lists: [[9, 0], [0, 11]].
