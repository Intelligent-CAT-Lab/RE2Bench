[THOUGHT]
1. The function `factor_terms` simplifies an expression by factoring out common terms. The input `expr` is the string `"2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)"`.
2. First, `sympify` converts the string to a SymPy expression: `2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)`.
3. The expression is a fraction: numerator `2*x`, denominator `a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2`. The denominator is an `Add` with terms `a**2*x**2` and `-a**2*y**2`.
4. `factor_terms` processes the denominator: it factors out the common factor `a**2` from the two terms, resulting in `a**2*(x**2 - y**2)`.
5. The entire expression becomes `2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))`.
6. No further factoring occurs because the numerator `2*x` and the denominator's inner term `x**2 - y**2` have no common factors (and `x**2 - y**2` is not factorized further by `factor_terms` with default parameters).
7. The output is the simplified expression as a SymPy object, which when converted to a string gives `"2*x/(a**2*(x**2 - y**2))"`.
