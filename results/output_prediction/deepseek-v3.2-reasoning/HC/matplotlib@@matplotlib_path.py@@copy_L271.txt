[THOUGHT]
1. The `copy` method of the Path class is defined as `return copy.copy(self)`, which performs a shallow copy of the instance.
2. The input `self` has attributes: `_vertices`, `_codes`, `_interpolation_steps`, `_simplify_threshold`, `_should_simplify`, and `_readonly`.
3. The shallow copy creates a new Path instance with the same attributes, referencing the same numpy arrays (`_vertices` and `_codes`).
4. Since `__init__` is not called during copying, the new instance retains the exact attribute values from the original.
5. Therefore, the output is a new Path object with the same state as the input self.
6. Representing the output as a dictionary of attributes matches the input format.
