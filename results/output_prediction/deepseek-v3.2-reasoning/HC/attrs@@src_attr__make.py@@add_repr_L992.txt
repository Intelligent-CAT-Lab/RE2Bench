[THOUGHT]
1. The method `add_repr` of `_ClassBuilder` is called with `ns` set to `None` and no keyword arguments.
2. The method does the following:
   - Calls `_make_repr_script` with `self._attrs` and `ns`. Since we don't have the actual `self._attrs`, we note that this call happens but does not affect the return value.
   - Defines a function `_attach_repr` that will attach the `__repr__` method to the class dictionary.
   - Appends a tuple `(script, globs, _attach_repr)` to `self._script_snippets`.
   - Sets `self._repr_added` to `True`.
   - Returns `self`.
3. Since the return value is `self`, and the input `self` is represented by the string `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`, the output is that string.
