[THOUGHT]
1. The `_setup` method starts by creating a copy of `self` called `new`.
2. Since `self._tick_params` is `null`, `new.tick()` is called. Assuming default behavior for a log scale, this sets `_tick_params` to values typical for log scaling.
3. Since `self._label_params` is `null`, `new.label()` is called. Assuming default behavior for a log scale, this sets `_label_params` appropriately.
4. `forward` and `inverse` transforms are obtained via `_get_transform()`. Given `trans` is "log", `forward` is a logarithmic function and `inverse` is an exponential function.
5. `mpl_scale` is created using `_get_scale()` with the data name "ymax" and the transforms, resulting in a Matplotlib log scale object.
6. An axis is created (since `axis` is `None`), configured with the scale, and default locators/formatters are set.
7. `new._matplotlib_scale` is assigned the scale object.
8. Since `prop.normed` is likely `False` (not specified), normalization is skipped: `normalize`, `vmin`, `vmax` are `None`.
9. The pipeline is built: `[axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`.
10. A spacer function is defined and assigned.
11. `prop.legend` is likely `False` (not specified), so `_legend` remains `null`.
12. The returned object `new` has attributes populated as described.

Given missing implementations and data values, reasonable defaults are assumed for log scale parameters.
