We need to compute multinomial_coefficients(4, 2). Let's trace through the function step by step:

1. First, m and n are converted to integers via as_int: m=4, n=2.
2. m=4 is not 0, so skip the first condition.
3. m=4 ≠ 2, so skip the second condition.
4. Check: m >= 2*n? 4 >= 4 (True) and n > 1? 2 > 1 (True). So the condition `if m >= 2*n and n > 1` is satisfied.
5. Therefore, the function returns `dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(m, n))`.

Now we need to compute multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2):
- In the iterator, first m=4, n=2.
- Check: m < 2*n? 4 < 4 (False). n == 1? 2 == 1 (False). So we go to the else branch.
- Precompute mc = multinomial_coefficients(2, 2):
  - For m=2, n=2: m=2 triggers the condition `if m == 2`, so it returns binomial_coefficients(2).
  - binomial_coefficients(2) returns:
    {(0, 2): 1, (1, 1): 2, (2, 0): 1}
- Then create mc1 dictionary with filtered non-zero tuples:
  - For (0,2): filter(None, (0,2)) -> (2,) -> key (2,): value 1
  - For (1,1): filter(None, (1,1)) -> (1,1) -> key (1,1): value 2
  - For (2,0): filter(None, (2,0)) -> (2,) -> key (2,): value 1
  So mc = {(2,): 1, (1,1): 2}
- Initialize t = [2] + [0]*(4-1) = [2,0,0,0]
- t1 = tuple(t) = (2,0,0,0)
- b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (2,)
- Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((2,0,0,0), 1)
- Since n=2 (non-zero), set j = 0 (leftmost nonzero position).
- Now enter the while loop (j < m-1, i.e., 0 < 3):
  - First iteration:
    - tj = t[0] = 2
    - Since j=0, we don't move t[j] to t[0] (j>0 condition false)
    - Since tj > 1:
      - t[1] += 1 -> t becomes [2,1,0,0]
      - j = 0
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [1,1,0,0]
    - t1 = (1,1,0,0)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((1,1,0,0), 2)
  - Second iteration (j=0):
    - tj = t[0] = 1
    - j=0, so no move
    - tj is not > 1, so:
      - j += 1 -> j=1
      - t[1] += 1 -> t becomes [1,2,0,0]
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [0,2,0,0]
    - t1 = (0,2,0,0)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (2,)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((0,2,0,0), 1)
  - Third iteration (j=1):
    - tj = t[1] = 2
    - j>0, so:
      - t[1] = 0
      - t[0] = tj -> t becomes [2,0,0,0]
    - tj > 1:
      - t[2] += 1 -> t becomes [2,0,1,0]
      - j = 0
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [1,0,1,0]
    - t1 = (1,0,1,0)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((1,0,1,0), 2)
  - Fourth iteration (j=0):
    - tj = t[0] = 1
    - j=0, so no move
    - tj not > 1:
      - j += 1 -> j=1
      - t[1] += 1 -> t becomes [1,1,1,0]
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [0,1,1,0]
    - t1 = (0,1,1,0)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((0,1,1,0), 2)
  - Fifth iteration (j=1):
    - tj = t[1] = 1
    - j>0:
      - t[1] = 0
      - t[0] = tj -> t becomes [1,0,1,0]
    - tj not > 1:
      - j += 1 -> j=2
      - t[2] += 1 -> t becomes [1,0,2,0]
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [0,0,2,0]
    - t1 = (0,0,2,0)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (2,)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((0,0,2,0), 1)
  - Sixth iteration (j=2):
    - tj = t[2] = 2
    - j>0:
      - t[2] = 0
      - t[0] = tj -> t becomes [2,0,0,0]
    - tj > 1:
      - t[3] += 1 -> t becomes [2,0,0,1]
      - j = 0
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [1,0,0,1]
    - t1 = (1,0,0,1)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((1,0,0,1), 2)
  - Seventh iteration (j=0):
    - tj = t[0] = 1
    - j=0, no move
    - tj not > 1:
      - j += 1 -> j=1
      - t[1] += 1 -> t becomes [1,1,0,1]
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [0,1,0,1]
    - t1 = (0,1,0,1)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((0,1,0,1), 2)
  - Eighth iteration (j=1):
    - tj = t[1] = 1
    - j>0:
      - t[1] = 0
      - t[0] = tj -> t becomes [1,0,0,1]
    - tj not > 1:
      - j += 1 -> j=2
      - t[2] += 1 -> t becomes [1,0,1,1]
    - t[0] -= 1 -> t becomes [0,0,1,1]
    - t1 = (0,0,1,1)
    - b = tuple(filter(None, t1)) = (1,1)
    - Yield (t1, mc[b]) = ((0,0,1,1), 2)
  - Ninth iteration (j=2):
    - tj = t[2] = 1
    - j>0:
