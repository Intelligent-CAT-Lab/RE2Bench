Looking at the code and input, I need to simulate the execution of `get_metadata_routing` method.

[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides a `self` object with:
   - A `registry` attribute (unused in the method)
   - A `_metadata_request` attribute which is a string representation of a dictionary

2. The method `get_metadata_routing()` simply calls `self._get_metadata_request()`

3. Looking at the `_get_metadata_request` function provided:
   - It checks if the object has `_metadata_request` attribute → True
   - It calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)` with the string value

4. Since `get_routing_for_object` is not defined in the provided code, but the input's `_metadata_request` is already a string representation, and we need to output something, I should return what this function would logically return.

5. Based on the input string format and typical behavior of such routing functions, it would likely parse/return the dictionary structure represented by the string.

6. The string appears to be a Python dictionary representation, so the output should be this dictionary (or equivalent).

7. Therefore, `get_metadata_routing()` would return this string/dictionary representation.

    "output": "{'fit': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'transform': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'inverse_transform': {'sample_weight': None, 'metadata': None}}"
