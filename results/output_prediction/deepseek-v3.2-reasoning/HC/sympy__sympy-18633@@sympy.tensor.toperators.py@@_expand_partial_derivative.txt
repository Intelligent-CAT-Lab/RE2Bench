1. The method `_expand_partial_derivative` is called on `self`, where `self` is a `PartialDerivative` instance. From the input, `self` has `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` all set to `null`, but no explicit `args` are provided. However, based on the method's properties, `self.expr` and `self.variables` are derived from `self.args`. Since the input does not specify `self.args`, I assume a minimal case where `self.expr` is a simple `Symbol` (e.g., `Symbol('x')`) and `self.variables` is an empty list, as no variables are mentioned.

2. In `_expand_partial_derivative`, it first calls `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`. With `self.variables = []`, `variables_opposite_valence` becomes empty.

3. `_contract_indices_for_derivative` then calls `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices([expr], replace_indices=True)`. Since `expr` is a `Symbol` and not a `TensExpr`, `get_indices(expr)` returns an empty tuple `()`.

4. In `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices`, `args_indices` is `[()]`. Processing this in `_indices_to_free_dum` results in no indices: `free` is `[]`, `free_names` is `[]`, `dummy_data` is `[]`.

5. With `replace_indices=True` but no replacements needed, `args` remains `[expr]`, `indices` is `[]`, `free` is `[]`, and `dum` is `[]` (from `_dummy_data_to_dum`).

6. Back in `_expand_partial_derivative`, `obj = self.func(*args)` creates a new `PartialDerivative` instance with `expr` and no variables. `obj._indices`, `obj._free`, `obj._dum` are set to the computed `indices`, `free`, `dum`, all empty lists.

7. `result = obj`. The condition `if not args[0].free_symbols` is false because `expr` (a `Symbol`) has free symbols. `obj.expr` is not an instance of `TensAdd` or `TensMul`, so no further changes occur.

8. The method returns `result`, which is the `PartialDerivative` object with `_indices = []`, `_free = []`, `_dum = []`.

Thus, the output values for `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are all empty lists.
