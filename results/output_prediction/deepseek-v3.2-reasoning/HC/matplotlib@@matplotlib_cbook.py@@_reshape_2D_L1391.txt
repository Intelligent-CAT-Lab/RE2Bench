The input JSON shows X as a string, but it represents a list of lists. Likely, the intended value is the Python list. So I will treat X as the list: [[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409], [0.78306588, 0.97289726, 0.48320961], [0.33642111, 0.56741904, 0.04794151], [0.38893703, 0.90630365, 0.16101821], [0.74362113, 0.63297416, 0.32418002]].

Now, in the function _reshape_2D:
1. X is passed to _unpack_to_numpy. Since it is a list, _unpack_to_numpy returns it unchanged (not a numpy array).
2. isinstance(X, np.ndarray) is False, so skip the first block.
3. len(X) = 5, not 0.
4. Initialize result = [], is_1d = True.
5. Iterate over each element xi in X (each is a list of 3 numbers):
   a. xi is not a string, so check iter(xi) which succeeds, so set is_1d = False.
   b. Convert xi to numpy array: xi = np.asanyarray(xi). This gives a 1-D array of 3 floats.
   c. nd = np.ndim(xi) = 1. Since nd is not >1, no error.
   d. Append xi.reshape(-1) to result. Since xi is already 1-D, reshape(-1) does nothing. So result gets a 1-D array of 3 floats.
6. After loop, is_1d is False, so return result.

Thus, the output is a list of 5 numpy arrays, each of length 3, containing the numbers from the inner lists.

In JSON-serializable form, this is a list of 5 lists of 3 numbers each.
