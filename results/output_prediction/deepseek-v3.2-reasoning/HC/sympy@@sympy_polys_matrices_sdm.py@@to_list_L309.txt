[THOUGHT]
1. The method `to_list(M)` expects M to be an SDM instance, which is a dict with integer keys for rows, each mapping to a dict of column keys to elements.
2. In the input, M is provided as a dict with string keys, but these correspond to integer indices.
3. The shape of M is not explicitly given, but from the keys, we infer that there are rows 0 and 1, and columns 0 and 1, so shape is (2,2).
4. The domain's zero element is not specified, but it is only used to initialize the dense matrix, and then overwritten by the actual elements from M.
5. Therefore, the output dense matrix ddm will be a 2x2 list where ddm[i][j] = M[i][j].
6. The elements are given as strings representing matrices, so the output will be a list of lists of these strings.
