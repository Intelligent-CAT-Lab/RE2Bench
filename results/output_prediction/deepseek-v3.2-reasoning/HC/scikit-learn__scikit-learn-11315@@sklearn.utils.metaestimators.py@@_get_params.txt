[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `_get_params` with given inputs.

Input `self` object has attributes:
- transformers: null
- remainder: "passthrough"
- n_jobs: 1
- transformer_weights: null
- _remainder: ["remainder", "passthrough", null]
- transformers_: null

Args: attr = "_transformers"
Kwargs: deep = false

Looking at the `_get_params` method in `_BaseComposition`:
1. First calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`
2. Since deep=false, it immediately returns `out` without any further processing.

So we need to compute what `super().get_params(deep=false)` returns for this object.

Looking at `BaseEstimator.get_params` implementation:
- It gets param names via `_get_param_names()`
- For each key in param names, it gets the attribute value from self
- Since deep=false, it doesn't recurse into nested objects with get_params()
- Returns a dict with {key: value}

We need to determine what `_get_param_names()` would return for this class instance. Since we don't have the exact class, we infer from the input object and typical sklearn patterns.

The input object has attributes that look like they could be constructor parameters:
- transformers
- remainder  
- n_jobs
- transformer_weights
- transformers_ (likely internal, not a parameter)

Also, `_BaseComposition` is a base class, and the actual class might be something like ColumnTransformer.

Given the output structure expects keys: n_jobs, remainder, transformer_weights, transformers, these are likely the constructor parameters.

From the input:
- n_jobs: 1
- remainder: "passthrough"
- transformer_weights: null
- transformers: null

So `super().get_params(deep=false)` should return a dict with these 4 keys and their values from self.

Therefore output is:
- n_jobs: 1
- remainder: "passthrough"
- transformer_weights: null
- transformers: null

Note: The `attr` parameter ("_transformers") is not used when deep=false.
