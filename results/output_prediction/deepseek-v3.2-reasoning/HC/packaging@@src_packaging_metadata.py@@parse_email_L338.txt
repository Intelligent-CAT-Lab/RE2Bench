[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate `parse_email` with the input data string `"download-url: VaLuE"`. The function parses this as an email message. The parsed message will have one header: "download-url" with value "VaLuE". The header name is lowercased to "download-url". Since this is a standard metadata field, `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` likely maps it to "download_url", which is a string field. Thus, `raw` becomes `{"download_url": "VaLuE"}`. There is no email body, so `_get_payload` returns an empty string, which doesn't add anything to `raw` or `unparsed`. No other headers are present, so `unparsed` remains empty. The function returns a tuple of `raw` and `unparsed`.
