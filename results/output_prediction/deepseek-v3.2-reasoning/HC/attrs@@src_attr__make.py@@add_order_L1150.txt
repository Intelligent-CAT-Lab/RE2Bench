[THOUGHT]
1. The method `add_order` modifies `self._cls_dict` by adding four ordering methods generated by `_make_order`.
2. However, the input `self` object only contains the attributes `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr`.
3. Since the necessary attributes (`_cls`, `_attrs`, `_cls_dict`, `_add_method_dunders`) are not provided, we assume they are set to default values.
4. The method returns `self`, so the output is the `self` object.
5. The input representation of `self` is unchanged from the provided attributes because the modifications are to attributes not present in the input representation.
