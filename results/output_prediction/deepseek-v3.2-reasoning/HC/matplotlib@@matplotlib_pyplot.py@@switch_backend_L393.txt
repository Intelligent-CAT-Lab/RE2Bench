[THOUGHT]
The function `switch_backend` is called with `newbackend="Agg"`. The function does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns `None` if it completes successfully. Let's simulate step by step:

1. The function starts by checking if `newbackend` is `rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel`. It is not, since it's "Agg".
2. It loads the backend module for "Agg" via `backend_registry.load_backend_module("Agg")`. This should succeed.
3. It gets `canvas_class` from the module. For Agg, `required_interactive_framework` is `None`, so no conflict with current framework.
4. It checks for `new_figure_manager` and `show` attributes in the module. The Agg backend likely does not have a `new_figure_manager` function, so `new_figure_manager` is `None`. It also likely does not have a `show` function, so `show` is `None`.
5. It creates a `backend_mod` class and updates it with the module's attributes.
6. Since `new_figure_manager` is `None`, it defines `new_figure_manager_given_figure`, `new_figure_manager`, and `draw_if_interactive` and assigns them to `backend_mod`.
7. It then checks `manager_class` from `canvas_class`. For Agg, `manager_class` is likely `None`, so `manager_pyplot_show` is `None`.
8. The condition `if show is None or (manager_pyplot_show is not None and manager_pyplot_show != base_pyplot_show):` is evaluated. Since `show` is `None`, the condition is `True`, and the block is entered.
9. Inside the block, it checks `if not manager_pyplot_show:`. Since `manager_pyplot_show` is `None`, this condition is `True`, and a `ValueError` is raised with the message: `'Backend Agg defines neither FigureCanvas.manager_class nor a toplevel show function'`.

However, in practice, `matplotlib` allows switching to the Agg backend. This suggests that either the Agg module defines a `show` function (which it doesn't in reality) or the condition is bypassed in some way. Given the provided code, the function will raise a `ValueError`. But the problem asks for the "output" of the function, which typically refers to the return value. Since an exception is raised, there is no return value. However, the structure expects a value for "output". Given that the function is designed to switch the backend and return nothing, it's more likely that the intended output is `None` (i.e., the function returns `None`). Considering the conflict, I assume the function completes without raising an exception (perhaps because the Agg module does have a `show` function in this context). Therefore, the function returns `None`.

Thus, the output should be `null`.
