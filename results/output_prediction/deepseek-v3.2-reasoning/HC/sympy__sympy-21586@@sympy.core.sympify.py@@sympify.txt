[THOUGHT]
1. The function `sympify` is called with `a="2500/pi"` and `strict=True`.
2. Since `a` is a string, the condition `if not isinstance(a, str):` is False, so the block containing the `if strict:` raise is skipped (assuming the raise is inside that block based on typical sympify behavior).
3. The `iterable(a)` check likely returns False for strings (as they are treated specially), so the iterable block is skipped.
4. Another `if not isinstance(a, str):` block is also skipped.
5. The function proceeds to parse the string using `parse_expr`.
6. Transformations include `standard_transformations` and `t_convert_xor` (since `convert_xor=True` by default).
7. `parse_expr("2500/pi", local_dict=None, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)` returns a SymPy expression representing 2500 divided by pi.
8. The function returns this expression.
9. The output is represented as a string "2500/pi".
