[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of `as_terms` for the expression "-w**2 - x**2 + y**2 + z**2". The method processes each additive term: -w**2, -x**2, y**2, z**2. For each term, it extracts the coefficient and factors, decomposes powers, and builds a monomial vector. The commutative bases are sorted as [w, x, y, z]. The result is a tuple containing a list of term data and the list of bases. Each term data includes the term as a string, a coefficient tuple (real, imag), a monomial tuple (exponents for each base), and an empty non-commutative part tuple. The output is represented as a JSON-serializable structure.
