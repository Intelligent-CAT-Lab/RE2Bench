[THOUGHT]
The function `_safe_repr` is called with the following arguments:
- `object` = "dictionary" (a string)
- `context` = {"124132985094608": 1}
- `maxlevels` = None
- `level` = 1
- `changed_only` = True

We need to simulate the execution. The function first checks the type of `object`. Since `object` is a string, which is a built-in scalar type (in `pprint._builtin_scalars`), it immediately returns:
`(repr(object), True, False)`

The `repr` of the string "dictionary" is `"'dictionary'"` (with single quotes). Therefore, the function returns the tuple:
`("'dictionary'", True, False)`

The context and other arguments are not used for strings, so they don't affect the output.

Thus, the output is a tuple containing a string and two booleans. In JSON, we represent this as an array: `["'dictionary'", true, false]`.
