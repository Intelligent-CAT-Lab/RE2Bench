[THOUGHT]
The input `self` is the expression `1 + I` (complex number). 
Step 1: Check `self.is_number`: returns True because it's a complex number with no free symbols.
Step 2: Check `self.is_comparable`: returns False because it's not a real number (it has an imaginary part). 
Thus, the condition `if not self.is_comparable` is True, and the function raises a TypeError with the message "Cannot convert non-comparable expression to int".
Therefore, the function does not return a value; it raises an exception. 
However, the problem expects an output. Given the structure, we will output the exception message as a string.
