[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` is called on a Mul object representing "-pi/4".
2. We need to determine the arguments of self. In SymPy, the expression -pi/4 is represented as a Mul with args (-1, pi, 1/4).
3. We iterate over each argument:
   a. For argument -1:
      - a.is_zero is False, a.is_infinite is False.
      - Since a.is_zero is False and a.is_infinite is False, we go to the else branch.
      - In else branch:
         * Check if seen_zero is False and a.is_zero is None: seen_zero is False, but a.is_zero is False (not None), so condition false.
         * Check if seen_infinite is False and a.is_infinite is None: seen_infinite is False, but a.is_infinite is False (not None), so condition false.
      - So seen_zero remains False, seen_infinite remains False.
   b. For argument pi:
      - Similarly, a.is_zero and a.is_infinite are False.
      - Conditions not met, so no change.
   c. For argument 1/4:
      - Similarly, a.is_zero and a.is_infinite are False.
      - No change.
4. After loop, seen_zero = False, seen_infinite = False.
5. The method returns (False, False).
