1. The input provides an instance of `BboxBase` with `_points` as a string representing a 2x2 array: `[[0.125, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]]`. This corresponds to bottom-left (x0, y0) = (0.125, 0.1) and top-right (x1, y1) = (0.9, 0.9).
2. The `splitx` method is called with arguments `args = [0.85, 0.85]`. Inside `splitx`, the list `xf` is constructed as `[0, 0.85, 0.85, 1]`.
3. The extents are computed: `x0 = 0.125`, `y0 = 0.1`, `x1 = 0.9`, `y1 = 0.9`. The width `w = x1 - x0 = 0.775`.
4. Using `itertools.pairwise(xf)`, we get pairs: (0, 0.85), (0.85, 0.85), (0.85, 1).
5. For each pair (xf0, xf1), a `Bbox` is created with:
   - Bottom-left: `(x0 + xf0 * w, y0)`
   - Top-right: `(x0 + xf1 * w, y1)`
6. Compute for each pair:
   - Pair (0, 0.85): 
     - Bottom-left: (0.125 + 0 * 0.775 = 0.125, 0.1)
     - Top-right: (0.125 + 0.85 * 0.775 = 0.125 + 0.65875 = 0.78375, 0.9)
   - Pair (0.85, 0.85):
     - Both x-coordinates are 0.78375, so bounding box is [[0.78375, 0.1], [0.78375, 0.9]].
   - Pair (0.85, 1):
     - Bottom-left: (0.78375, 0.1)
     - Top-right: (0.125 + 1 * 0.775 = 0.9, 0.9)
7. The output is a list of these three bounding boxes, each represented as a list of two points.
