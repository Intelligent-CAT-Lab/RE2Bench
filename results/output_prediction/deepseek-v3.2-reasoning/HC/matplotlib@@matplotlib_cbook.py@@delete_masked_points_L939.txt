[THOUGHT]
1. Parse the input: the arguments to the function are a list of three items: two lists of 10 floats each and a None.
2. Call delete_masked_points with these three arguments.
3. The function checks length, nrecs = 10.
4. It processes each argument: first two are sequences of length 10, so they are converted to numpy arrays. The third is not a sequence, so left as None.
5. It builds masks: for the two arrays, np.isfinite returns True for all elements, so masks become two arrays of True.
6. The combined mask is all True, so igood has all indices (0-9). Since no points are deleted, the arrays are not sliced.
7. The function does not convert MaskedArrays because they are regular arrays.
8. The function returns a list containing the two numpy arrays and None.
9. For JSON output, we represent the arrays as lists of their values.
