Let me simulate the execution of `prepare_url` step by step:

1. Input values:
   - self: PreparedRequest instance with various attributes
   - url: "http://localhost:49515/"
   - params: {}

2. The method starts:
   - url is a string, not bytes, so `url = str(url)` doesn't change it
   - `url = url.lstrip()` removes leading whitespace (none to remove)

3. Check: if ':' in url and (not url.lower().startswith('http')):
   - ':' is in "http://localhost:49515/"
   - url.lower().startswith('http') is True
   - So condition is False (doesn't return early)

4. Try to parse URL with parse_url:
   - "http://localhost:49515/" should parse to:
     - scheme: "http"
     - auth: None
     - host: "localhost"
     - port: 49515
     - path: "/"
     - query: None
     - fragment: None

5. Validations:
   - scheme exists: "http" ✓
   - host exists: "localhost" ✓
   - Check if host is ASCII: "localhost" is ASCII, so unicode_is_ascii returns True
   - Since host is ASCII, skip IDNA encoding
   - Check if host starts with ('*', '.'): "localhost" doesn't

6. Build netloc:
   - auth is None, so netloc starts empty
   - Add host: "localhost"
   - Add port: ":49515"
   - Result: "localhost:49515"

7. Handle path:
   - Path is "/", so no change

8. Handle params:
   - params is {} (empty dict)
   - _encode_params({}) will return an empty string (since dict is empty)
   - enc_params = ""
   - Since enc_params is empty, query remains None

9. Build URL with urlunparse:
   - scheme: "http"
   - netloc: "localhost:49515"
   - path: "/"
   - params: None
   - query: None
   - fragment: None
   - Result: "http://localhost:49515/"

10. Apply requote_uri:
    - For a simple URL without special encoding needs, this likely returns the same string

11. Set self.url = "http://localhost:49515/"

The method doesn't return anything (returns None), but based on the structure, we need to output what the method produces. Since the method sets self.url and that seems to be the main effect, I'll output that value.
