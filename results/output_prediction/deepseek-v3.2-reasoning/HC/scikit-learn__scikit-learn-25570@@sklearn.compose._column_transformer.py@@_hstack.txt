Looking at the problem, I need to simulate the execution of the `_hstack` method given the input state. Let me analyze the input and trace through the code.

[THOUGHT]
1. First, I'll examine the `self` object state provided in the input:
   - `sparse_output_`: false
   - `transformers_`: null
   - `verbose_feature_names_out`: true
   - `_name_to_fitted_passthrough`: has a FunctionTransformer for "remainder"
   - `output_indices_`: shows "scale" with 2 columns (slice 0-2) and "remainder" with 1 column (slice 2-3)

2. The `_hstack` method is called with `Xs` as null (None). Looking at the code, `_hstack` expects a list of transformed arrays.

3. The `_hstack` method starts by checking `self.sparse_output_`. Since it's false, we go to the else branch:
   - `Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]`
   - Since `Xs` is null, this would fail. But let me check if there's something I'm missing.

4. Looking at the code flow: `_hstack` is called from `transform()` method with `Xs` as the result of `_fit_transform()`.
   However, in this input state, `Xs` is explicitly given as null in the args.

5. Let me trace what happens when `Xs` is null:
   - The list comprehension would try to iterate over `None`, which would raise an error
   - But maybe `Xs` is meant to be an empty list or something else?

6. Looking more carefully at the input structure: `"args": {"Xs": null}` - this means Xs is None/null

7. In the else branch, after converting sparse matrices:
   - It gets the output config: `config = _get_output_config('transform', self)`
   - Since `Xs` is null/None, we can't check `hasattr(X, 'iloc')` for each X in Xs
   - The condition `all((hasattr(X, 'iloc') for X in Xs))` would be True for empty Xs
   - But we would need to check if `config['dense'] == 'pandas'`

8. Without actual Xs data, I need to think about what the method would return:
   - The method would likely return an empty array if Xs is empty/None
   - Looking at the end of the method: `return np.hstack(Xs)`
   - If Xs is None, this would fail
   - If Xs is an empty list, `np.hstack([])` returns array([], dtype=float64)

9. Given that the transformers_ is null and no actual transformed data is provided, it seems like this might represent an edge case where there's no data to stack.

10. The output structure expects a value for "output", which would be the return value of `_hstack`.
    Given the state and that Xs is null, the most reasonable output would be an empty array.

11. Looking at similar code patterns in scikit-learn's ColumnTransformer, when there are no transformers or empty results, it often returns an empty array with shape (0, something).

Given all this analysis, I believe the output would be an empty numpy array.
