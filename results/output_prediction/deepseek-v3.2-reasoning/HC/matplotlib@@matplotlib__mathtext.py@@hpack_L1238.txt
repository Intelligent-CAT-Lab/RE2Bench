We are given an Hlist object with two children, both Hlists themselves. The hpack method is called with w=0.0 and m='additional'. We need to compute the new attributes after packing.

First, we extract the dimensions of the children from their string representations:
- Child1: width=10.58, height=13.00, depth=0.00, shift_amount=0.00.
- Child2: width=8.08, height=9.10, depth=0.00, shift_amount=-7.00.

Initialize h=0.0, d=0.0, x=0.0, total_stretch=[0.0]*4, total_shrink=[0.0]*4.

Iterate over children:
- For child1 (Box): x += 10.58 → x=10.58. h = max(0.0, 13.00 - 0.00) = 13.00. d = max(0.0, 0.00 + 0.00) = 0.00.
- For child2 (Box): x += 8.08 → x=18.66. h = max(13.00, 9.10 - (-7.00)) = max(13.00, 16.10) = 16.10. d = max(0.00, 0.00 + (-7.00)) = max(0.00, -7.00) = 0.00.

After loop: height = h = 16.10, depth = d = 0.00, total width sum x = 18.66.

Since m='additional', w = w + x = 0.0 + 18.66 = 18.66. So self.width = 18.66.

Compute x_diff = w - x = 18.66 - 18.66 = 0.0. Since x_diff == 0.0, set glue_sign=0, glue_order=0, glue_ratio=0.0.

The shift_amount remains 0.0 from input.

Now the object's string representation should reflect the new dimensions. Using the children's existing string representations, we construct the outer representation with updated w, h, d, s. The children are indented by two spaces, and commas separate them. The resulting string is as computed.
