[THOUGHT]
1. The input self is "pi/2", which in SymPy represents a multiplication of pi and 1/2 (i.e., Mul(pi, Rational(1,2))).
2. The method `_eval_is_infinite` calls `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` to get (seen_zero, seen_infinite).
3. In the helper, we iterate over the args: pi and 1/2.
   - For pi: 
     - pi.is_zero is False, pi.is_infinite is False.
     - Neither condition in if/elif triggers, so go to else.
     - In else: seen_zero is False and pi.is_zero is None? pi.is_zero is False, not None, so no change. Similarly for is_infinite.
   - For 1/2:
     - Similarly, is_zero and is_infinite are False, so no changes.
   - After loop, seen_zero = False, seen_infinite = False.
4. In `_eval_is_infinite`: since seen_infinite is False, return False.
5. Therefore, the output is False.
