[THOUGHT]
The function `get_integer_part` computes the integer part of the real and imaginary parts of a given expression, adjusting based on the sign parameter `no`. For `no=1`, it computes the ceiling of the real part. The expression `5*sqrt(42949673)` evaluates to approximately 32767.9993895, so its ceiling is 32768. The imaginary part is 0. With `return_ints=true`, the function returns `(32768, 0)`.
