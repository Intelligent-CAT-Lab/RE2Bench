The function `_common_new` processes the input to create an integral structure. Given the input with `function="1"` and `symbols=["x"]`, the function sympifies the function to `Integer(1)`, processes the symbol `"x"` as a `Symbol('x')`, and returns a tuple containing the function, limits, and orientation. The limits are represented as a list containing a single tuple with the symbol. The output is serializable as a JSON array.

[THOUGHT]
1. `function` is sympified from `"1"` to `Integer(1)`.
2. `symbols` is non-empty, so `_process_limits` is called with `["x"]` and `discrete=False`.
3. In `_process_limits`, `"x"` is treated as a `Symbol('x')`. Since it's a Symbol, `limits` becomes `[Tuple(Symbol('x'))]` and `orientation` is `1`.
4. The while loop `cls == type(function)` is false because `cls` is a string and `type(function)` is `Integer`.
5. `symbols_of_integration` is `{Symbol('x')}`. `function.atoms(Piecewise)` is empty, so no replacements.
6. `piecewise_fold` leaves `function` unchanged.
7. The function returns `(1, [Tuple(Symbol('x'))], 1)`.
8. JSON representation: `1` as `1`, `[Tuple(Symbol('x'))]` as `[["x"]]`, `orientation` as `1`.
