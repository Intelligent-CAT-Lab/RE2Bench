[THOUGHT]
1. The input has `self.transformers_` as null (None), indicating the ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted.
2. The `transform` method begins with `check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_')`, which checks for the presence and non-null value of the `transformers_` attribute.
3. Since `self.transformers_` is None, `check_is_fitted` raises a `NotFittedError` with a standard message.
4. Therefore, the function does not return a value but raises an exception.
