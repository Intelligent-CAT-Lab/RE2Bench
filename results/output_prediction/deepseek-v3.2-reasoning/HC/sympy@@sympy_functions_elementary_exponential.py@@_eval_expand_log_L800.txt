[THOUGHT]
Given the input, we have a log instance with nargs={1,2}. However, the actual arguments of the log instance are not provided. To proceed, we assume that the log instance has one argument, which is a symbol 'x'. Then:

1. The function `_eval_expand_log` is called with deep=true and hints: force=false, factor=false, and others (which are not used in the function).

2. Since len(self.args) is 1 (assuming one argument), we skip the branch for len(self.args)==2.

3. We set arg = self.args[0] = x (a symbol).

4. arg is not an Integer, not Rational, not Mul, not Pow or exp, and not a Product. Therefore, none of the expansion conditions are met.

5. The function returns self.func(arg) = log(x).

Thus, the output is log(x).
