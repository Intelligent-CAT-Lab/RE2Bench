[THOUGHT]
The `add_attrs_init` method returns `self` (the instance of `_ClassBuilder`). The input provides a `self` dictionary with keys `auto_attribs`, `these`, and `has_custom_setattr`. Since the method returns the instance itself, and we are to represent the output in JSON, the output should be the same `self` dictionary as provided in the input. The method does modify `self._script_snippets`, but that attribute is not present in the input dictionary, so we cannot reflect that change. Therefore, the output is simply the input `self` dictionary.
