[THOUGHT]
1. The `clone` method creates a new instance of the same class as `self`.
2. It copies all key-value pairs from `self` to the new object. In the input, `self` is an empty dictionary, so no keys are copied.
3. It then updates the new object with the `updates` dictionary, which is `{"gens": ["cos(phi)"]}`. So the new object will have one key: "gens" with value `["cos(phi)"]`.
4. The method returns this new object.
5. The output structure asks for values of "fraction" and "gens". The returned object has the key "gens" with value `["cos(phi)"]`. It does not have the key "fraction". Therefore, the value for "fraction" is not defined, which we represent as null in JSON. The value for "gens" is `["cos(phi)"]`.

{
    "fraction": null,
    "gens": ["cos(phi)"]
