I simulated the execution of the BayesianRidge fit method with the given inputs. The data was preprocessed by centering using weighted means (due to sample weights) and then rescaled by the square root of the sample weights. The algorithm converged in 3 iterations, as the change in coefficients fell below the tolerance of 0.001. The computed scores (log marginal likelihood) were constant across iterations due to minimal updates. The final model parameters were: alpha_ (precision of the noise) approximately 0.174615, lambda_ (precision of the weights) 1.0, coefficients [0.344, 0.0], intercept approximately 1.597, and covariance matrix [[0.057, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]]. The second coefficient is zero because the second feature became irrelevant after rescaling and SVD, resulting in a singular value of zero.
