[THOUGHT]
The input provides num_dates as null (None in Python). When decode_cf_datetime is called with num_dates=None, units="days since 0001-01-01", and calendar="366_day", the function first converts num_dates to a numpy array using np.asarray(None), resulting in a scalar object array containing None. Then it flattens this array. Since the calendar "366_day" is not in _STANDARD_CALENDARS, the attempt to use _decode_datetime_with_pandas raises an OutOfBoundsDatetime exception. This exception is caught, and the function proceeds to call _decode_datetime_with_cftime with flat_num_dates.astype(float). However, converting an object array containing None to float raises a TypeError, which is not caught by the exception handler. Therefore, the function raises a TypeError and does not return a value. Thus, there is no normal output from the function.
