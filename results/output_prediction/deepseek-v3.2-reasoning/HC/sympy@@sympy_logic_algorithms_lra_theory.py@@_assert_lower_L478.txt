[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_assert_lower` is called with arguments: xi (variable "x"), ci=(0,0), from_equality=true, from_neg=false.
2. `self.result` is initially null, so after `self.result = None`, it remains None.
3. We need to compare ci with xi.lower and xi.upper. Since the input does not specify the current bounds of xi, we assume default bounds: lower = (-inf, 0) and upper = (inf, 0). Thus, (0,0) <= (-inf, 0) is false, and (0,0) > (inf, 0) is false.
4. Therefore, we set xi.lower = (0,0), xi.lower_from_eq = true, xi.lower_from_neg = false.
5. Next, we check if xi is in self.nonslack and xi.assign < ci. xi is in self.nonslack (since it's the variable represented by "x"). We assume xi.assign is (0,0) by default, so (0,0) < (0,0) is false, so no update occurs.
6. Since `run_checks` is false, we skip the matrix check.
7. The method returns None.
