[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_get_metadata_request` is called with `self` having an attribute `_metadata_request` that is a string representation of a dictionary.
2. The function checks `hasattr(self, '_metadata_request')` and finds it true, so it calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)`.
3. `get_routing_for_object` receives the string. The string does not have a `get_metadata_routing` method, and it does not have a `_type` attribute equal to "metadata_request" or "metadata_router". Therefore, it returns `MetadataRequest(owner=None)`.
4. The `MetadataRequest` constructor sets `owner=None` and for each method in `SIMPLE_METHODS` (which is not defined in the provided code, but likely includes methods like 'fit', 'transform', etc.), it sets a `MethodMetadataRequest` with empty requests.
5. Thus, the output is an instance of `MetadataRequest` with owner=None and empty method requests.
6. The output structure expects a value for "output". Since the function returns an object and we don't have its string representation, we assume it is represented as "MetadataRequest(owner=None)".
