[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the function `handle` with input `expr = 1/(a - b)`. The function `handle` is defined inside `radsimp`, but we assume default values for closure variables (symbolic=True, max_terms=4). The expression is a rational expression with numerator 1 and denominator a - b. Step-by-step analysis shows that `handle` returns essentially the same expression because the denominator is a simple Add without square roots, so no simplification occurs. The loop breaks early because nrad = 0. Thus, the output is `1/(a - b)`.
