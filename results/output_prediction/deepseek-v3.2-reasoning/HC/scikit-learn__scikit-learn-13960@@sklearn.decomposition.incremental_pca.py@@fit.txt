We need to simulate the `fit` method of `IncrementalPCA` on the given input data (Iris dataset, 150 samples, 4 features) with `n_components=2`, `whiten=False`, `copy=True`, and `batch_size=50`. The data is processed in three batches of 50 samples each. The method incrementally updates the statistics and computes PCA via SVD. After processing all batches, the final attributes are set as follows:

- `n_components`, `whiten`, `copy`, `batch_size` remain as provided.
- `batch_size_` is set to `batch_size` (50).
- `n_components_` is set to `n_components` (2).
- `n_samples_seen_` becomes 150 (total samples).
- `mean_` becomes the overall mean vector of the dataset.
- `var_` becomes the population variance (divided by n) for each feature.
- `components_` are the top two eigenvectors of the covariance matrix (unit norm).
- `singular_values_` are the singular values of the centered data matrix.
- `explained_variance_` are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (sample variance).
- `explained_variance_ratio_` are the proportions of total variance explained by each component.
- `noise_variance_` is the average of the remaining eigenvalues.

Using known statistics of the Iris dataset and approximate calculations:
- Overall mean: [5.8433, 3.0573, 3.7580, 1.1993].
- Population variances: [0.6804, 0.1877, 3.0974, 0.5751].
- Eigenvalues (sample covariance): ~4.224, ~0.242, ~0.078, ~0.023.
- Singular values: sqrt(eigenvalues * 149) ≈ [25.0865, 6.0050].
- Components (eigenvectors): approximately [[0.3614, -0.0823, 0.8566, 0.3583], [-0.6566, -0.7302, 0.1734, 0.1245]].
- Explained variance ratios: ~0.9246, ~0.0530.
- Noise variance: average of remaining eigenvalues ≈ 0.0505.

These values are rounded to four decimal places for clarity.
