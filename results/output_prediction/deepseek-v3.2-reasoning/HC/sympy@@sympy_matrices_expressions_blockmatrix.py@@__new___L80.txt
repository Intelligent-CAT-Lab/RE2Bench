[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides a single argument: a 2x2 list of matrices represented as strings. Inside the function, this is treated as `rows`.
2. The function checks that `rows` is a sequence and that each row has the same length (2), so `blocky = ok = True`.
3. It then checks that all matrices in each row have the same number of rows:
   - Row 0: both matrices have 3 rows.
   - Row 1: both matrices have 2 rows.
   So this condition holds.
4. It checks that all matrices in each column have the same number of columns:
   - Column 0: both matrices have 2 columns.
   - Column 1: both matrices have 3 columns.
   So this condition holds.
5. Since all checks pass, the function creates an `ImmutableDenseMatrix` with the given rows (the matrix blocks) and then creates a `BlockMatrix` instance via `Basic.__new__(cls, mat)`.
6. The `BlockMatrix` instance is returned as the output.
