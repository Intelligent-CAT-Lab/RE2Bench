[THOUGHT]
1. The input self is "cos(phi)**2", which represents a Pow object with base = cos(phi) and exp = 2.
2. In _eval_is_rational, first condition checks: exp.is_integer (True), base.is_rational (False for cos(phi) since it's a symbolic expression), so condition fails.
3. Then p = self.func(*self.as_base_exp()) gives Pow(cos(phi), 2) again, which is still Pow.
4. Then b, e = p.as_base_exp() -> b = cos(phi), e = 2.
5. Check e.is_Rational and b.is_Rational: e is Rational (True) but b is not Rational (False), so false.
6. Check e.is_integer: True.
   - Inside, if b.is_rational: false.
   - elif b.is_irrational: false (cos(phi) is not irrational).
   So no return.
7. Check if b is S.Exp1: false.
8. Function ends without return, so returns None.
