[THOUGHT]
The function `_construct_simple` is called with `coeffs = None` and `opt = {}`. 
- The function starts by setting up flags and then checks `opt.extension`. Since `opt` is an empty dictionary, it does not have an attribute `extension`. This results in an AttributeError when the code tries to access `opt.extension`.
- Due to this error, the function does not complete execution and does not return a value.
- Therefore, the output cannot be a valid return value from the function. Given the output structure expects a JSON value, and considering that the function would not return anything under these conditions, the output is best represented as `null`.
