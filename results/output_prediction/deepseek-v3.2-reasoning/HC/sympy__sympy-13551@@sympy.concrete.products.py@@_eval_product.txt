[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_product` is called with `term = (i**2 + 5*i + 4)/(i**2 + 2*i - 3)` and `limits = (i, u+v, u-1)`. The term is a rational function in `i`, which factors as `(i+1)(i+4)/((i+3)(i-1))`. The product is computed by splitting into factors and evaluating each using the polynomial case, which returns rising factorials. The result is a product of rising factorials:

`RisingFactorial(u+v+1, -v) * RisingFactorial(u+v+4, -v) / (RisingFactorial(u+v+3, -v) * RisingFactorial(u+v-1, -v))`.

This matches direct evaluation for specific values of `v`.
