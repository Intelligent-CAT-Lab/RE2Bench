[THOUGHT]
We need to compute the output of `_minibatch_step` given the input. The function updates W using multiplicative update (since `fresh_restarts` is false and W is provided), then computes the batch cost as the beta divergence (Frobenius norm squared loss) plus regularization terms, divided by the batch size. Since `alpha_W` and `alpha_H` are 0, regularization terms vanish. The beta divergence for `beta_loss=2` is half the squared Frobenius norm of (X - W@H). We computed the updated W precisely using the given X, W, H, and the internal HHt and XHt matrices. After updating W, we computed WH = updated W @ H, then X - WH, its squared Frobenius norm, and finally the batch cost. The result is approximately 1.29731.
