[THOUGHT]
1. The input expression is 1/(a-b) with symbolic=False and max_terms=1.
2. In radsimp, coeff, expr = expr.as_coeff_Add() yields coeff=0, expr=1/(a-b).
3. old = fraction(expr) gives (1, a-b).
4. handle(expr) is called. Inside handle, since symbolic=False and denominator a-b has free symbols, handle returns the expression unchanged.
5. Thus n, d from handle are also (1, a-b).
6. Since old equals (n,d), the subsequent if block is skipped.
7. The function returns coeff + _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1/d) = 1/(a-b).
8. Therefore, the output is the same as the input expression.
