[THOUGHT]
The function `split_super_sub` processes the input string "Fvec". The string length is 4, so the function does not return early. It initializes `pos = 0`, `name = None`, `supers = []`, `subs = []`. It enters a loop to parse the string.

- In the first iteration, it looks for '^' and '_' starting from index 1, but neither is found, so `pos_next` becomes 4. The `part` extracted is "Fvec". Since `name` is None, it sets `name = "Fvec"`. Then `pos` becomes 4, which equals the length of the string, so the loop ends.

After the loop, `name = "Fvec"`, `supers = []`, `subs = []`. The regex `_name_with_digits_p` matches strings with letters followed by digits, but "Fvec" has no digits, so it does not match. Thus, the function returns `("Fvec", [], [])`.

In JSON, this tuple is represented as an array.
