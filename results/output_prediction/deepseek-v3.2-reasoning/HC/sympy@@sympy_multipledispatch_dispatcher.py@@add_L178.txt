[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the `add` method step by step with the given input:

1. **Input analysis**:
   - `self`: A Dispatcher instance (represented as "<dispatched SymmetricHandler>")
   - `signature`: `["<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>"]` (a list with one string)
   - `func`: "<function _>" (a function object)
   - `on_ambiguity`: "<function ambiguity_warn at >"

2. **Method execution**:
   - First check: `if not signature` → signature is non-empty list, so condition is `False`.
   - Next check: `if any(isinstance(typ, tuple) for typ in signature)` → iterates through signature elements. The only element is a string, not a tuple, so condition is `False`.
   - Next: Loop through each `typ` in `signature`:
     - `typ = "<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>"`
     - Check `if not isinstance(typ, type)`: `typ` is a string, not a Python `type` object, so this condition is `True`.
     - Construct `str_sig`: Join elements of `signature` with `', '`, using `c.__name__` if `c` is a type else `str(c)`. Here, `c` is the string, so `str(c)` returns the same string.
       - `str_sig = "<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>"`
     - Raise `TypeError` with message:
       ```
       Tried to dispatch on non-type: <class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>
       In signature: <<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>>
       In function: <dispatched SymmetricHandler>
       ```
       Note: `self.name` is the Dispatcher's name attribute, which from the input appears to be "SymmetricHandler" (extracted from the string representation).

3. **Output**: The function raises a `TypeError` and does not return normally. The output structure expects a value for "output", but since an exception is raised, we should represent this as the exception message.

Given the structure requires a JSON output with "output" key, I'll provide the exception message as the value since that's what the function effectively "produces" (it doesn't complete successfully).
