[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` method given the input.

Looking at the method definition:
```python
def _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx):
    if not self._infrequent_enabled:
        return drop_idx
    default_to_infrequent = self._default_to_infrequent_mappings[feature_idx]
    if default_to_infrequent is None:
        return drop_idx
    infrequent_indices = self._infrequent_indices[feature_idx]
    if infrequent_indices is not None and drop_idx in infrequent_indices:
        categories = self.categories_[feature_idx]
        raise ValueError(f'Unable to drop category {categories[drop_idx]!r} from feature {feature_idx} because it is infrequent')
    return default_to_infrequent[drop_idx]
```

Given the input:
- `self._infrequent_enabled` = false
- `feature_idx` = 1
- `drop_idx` = "0" (as a string)

Step-by-step execution:
1. Check `if not self._infrequent_enabled`: Since `_infrequent_enabled` is false, the condition is true.
2. Therefore, the method immediately returns `drop_idx` without any further processing.
3. `drop_idx` = "0" (string)

Thus, the output is simply the input `drop_idx` value: "0".

Note: Even though `drop_idx` is passed as a string "0" while typically it might be an integer, the method returns it unchanged when `_infrequent_enabled` is false, so the type is preserved.
