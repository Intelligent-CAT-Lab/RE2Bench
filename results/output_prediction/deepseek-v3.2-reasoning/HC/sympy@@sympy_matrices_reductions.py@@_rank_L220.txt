[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_rank` is called with a 3x3 matrix of all ones, `iszerofunc` as `_iszero`, and `simplify=False`.
2. The matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns, so the early exit conditions for dimensions ≤ 1 or 2x2 do not apply.
3. `_permute_complexity_right` is called to permute columns based on complexity. Since all entries are 1, `iszerofunc(1)` returns `False` (not zero), so complexity for each column is 0. No permutation occurs.
4. `_row_reduce` is called on the matrix. Row reduction yields one nonzero row (pivot) and two zero rows, so the number of pivots is 1.
5. Therefore, the rank is 1.
