[THOUGHT]
1. The function `vpack` modifies the attributes of `self` but does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`).
2. Given the input `self` with children as described, we simulate the loop:
   - Child 1 (HCentered): width=5.96, height=6.30, depth=0.00, shift_amount=0.00 → updates: x=6.30, d=0.00, w=5.96.
   - Child 2 (Vbox): assumed as Box with zero dimensions → x=6.30, d=0.00, w unchanged.
   - Child 3 (Hrule): assumed as Box with zero dimensions → x=6.30, d=0.00, w unchanged.
   - Child 4 (Vbox): same as child 2 → x=6.30, d=0.00.
   - Child 5 (HCentered): same as child 1 → x=12.60, d=0.00, w=5.96.
3. After loop: w=5.96, d=0.00, x=12.60.
4. Since `l` is Infinity, `self.depth = d = 0.00`.
5. Because `m='additional'`, `h += x` → `h = 0.0 + 12.60 = 12.60`, so `self.height = 12.60`.
6. Then `x = h - x = 12.60 - 12.60 = 0.0`.
7. Since `x == 0`, set `self.glue_sign = 0`, `self.glue_order = 0`, `self.glue_ratio = 0.0`. Also set `self.width = w = 5.96`.
8. No glue adjustments needed, and no warning is triggered.
9. The function returns `None`.
