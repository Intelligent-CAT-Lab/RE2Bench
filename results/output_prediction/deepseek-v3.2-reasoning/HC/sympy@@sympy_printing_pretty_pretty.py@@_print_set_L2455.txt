[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_print_set` receives `s` as a list of strings: `["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`.
2. Since the set is not empty, we sort the items using `default_sort_key`. Both items are strings, and sorting lexicographically keeps the order as `["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`.
3. `_print_seq` is called with this sorted list. It creates prettyForm objects for each string, joins them with `", "` as delimiter, resulting in a sequence representation: `"Q.integer, Q.positive"`.
4. This sequence is then wrapped in curly braces via `prettyForm(*pretty.parens('{', '}', ifascii_nougly=True))`. Assuming no Unicode or ASCII-specific adjustments alter the braces, the resulting string is `{Q.integer, Q.positive}`.
5. The function returns a prettyForm object, but its string picture (first line) is `{Q.integer, Q.positive}`.
