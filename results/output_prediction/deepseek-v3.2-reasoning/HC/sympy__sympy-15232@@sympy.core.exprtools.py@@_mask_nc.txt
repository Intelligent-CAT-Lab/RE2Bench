[THOUGHT]
1. The input `eq` is provided as a string: `sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)")) + 1`. In the context of the function, `eq` is likely a SymPy expression. When sympified, this becomes `sin(Symbol('Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)')) + 1`. 
2. The function `_mask_nc` sets `expr = eq` and checks `expr.is_commutative`. Here, `sin` is a commutative function, `Symbol` is commutative by default, and addition is commutative. Thus, the entire expression is commutative.
3. Since `expr.is_commutative` is `True`, the function returns `(eq, {}, [])`.
4. The output is a tuple containing the original expression, an empty dictionary, and an empty list. For JSON representation, we output a string representation of this tuple.
5. Considering the input, the expression is most cleanly represented as `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1` (ignoring the inner quotes as a JSON artifact). Thus, the tuple is `(sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1, {}, [])`.
