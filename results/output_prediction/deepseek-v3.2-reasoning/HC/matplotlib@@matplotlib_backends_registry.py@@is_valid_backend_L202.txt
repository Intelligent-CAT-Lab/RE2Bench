[THOUGHT]
1. The method `is_valid_backend` is called with backend="Agg".
2. Since "Agg" does not start with 'module://', it is converted to lowercase: backend = "agg".
3. The `backwards_compat` dictionary does not have a key "agg", so backend remains "agg".
4. Check if backend is in `self._BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (a class attribute) or in `self._backend_to_gui_framework` (an instance attribute). The class attribute includes "agg" as a key (mapping to "headless"), so the condition is true.
5. Therefore, the method returns True without needing to load entry points or check further.
