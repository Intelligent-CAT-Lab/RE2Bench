[THOUGHT]
1. The function doit is defined inside Mod.eval. Given p = 2*t and q = t (symbolic expressions), we check the conditions.
2. q is not zero, not a number.
3. p/q simplifies to 2, so d = int(2) = 2.
4. rv = p - d*q = 2*t - 2*t = 0.
5. Condition (rv*q < 0) is false.
6. Therefore, doit returns 0.
