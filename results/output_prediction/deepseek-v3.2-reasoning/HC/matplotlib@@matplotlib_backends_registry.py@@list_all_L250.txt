[THOUGHT]
1. The method `list_all` is called on the given `BackendRegistry` instance.
2. It first calls `_ensure_entry_points_loaded`. Since `_loaded_entry_points` is false, it will load entry points.
3. `_read_entry_points` is called. We assume no entry points are present from the 'matplotlib.backend' group (since no environment info is given). The backward compatibility checks for 'inline' and 'ipympl' are performed, but we assume the packages are not installed or their versions are above the thresholds, so no entries are added. Thus, `entries` is an empty list.
4. `_validate_and_store_entry_points` is called with an empty list, so it does nothing. `_loaded_entry_points` is set to true. The dictionaries remain unchanged.
5. `list_all` then returns `[*self.list_builtin(), *self._backend_to_gui_framework]`.
6. `list_builtin()` with no filter returns all keys of `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (24 items in insertion order).
7. The keys of `_backend_to_gui_framework` are just one: `"module://matplotlib.backends.backend_agg"`.
8. The final list is the concatenation: 24 built-in backend names followed by the module string.

Thus, the output is a list of 25 strings.
