[THOUGHT]
Given input: self has _nrows=1, _ncols=1. key is provided as a list [0,0]. In typical usage, __getitem__ is called with a tuple for 2D indexing (like gridspec[0,0]), so we interpret key as (0,0). Since nrows=1 and ncols=1, _normalize(0,1,0) returns (0,0) and similarly for column. The function then uses np.ravel_multi_index, but for this simple case, the result will be num1=0 and num2=0. Therefore, __getitem__ returns a SubplotSpec object with attributes num1=0 and num2=0. The output is represented as a dictionary with these values.
