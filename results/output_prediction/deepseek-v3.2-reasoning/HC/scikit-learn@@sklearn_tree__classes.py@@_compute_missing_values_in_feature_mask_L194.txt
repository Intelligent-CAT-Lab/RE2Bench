[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate the execution of `_compute_missing_values_in_feature_mask` with the given inputs.

1. First, understand the inputs:
   - `self` is an instance of BaseDecisionTree (or a subclass) with given attributes. Key attributes: `monotonic_cst` is `null` (None in Python).
   - `X` is provided as a string representation of a 2D list. We need to parse it as a NumPy array.
   - `estimator_name` is `null` (None in Python), so within the function it will default to the class name.

2. The function `_compute_missing_values_in_feature_mask`:
   a. It first checks `self._support_missing_values(X)`. This returns True if:
        - X is not sparse
        - `self.__sklearn_tags__().input_tags.allow_nan` is True
        - `self.monotonic_cst` is None
      We don't have the exact `__sklearn_tags__` implementation, but the BaseDecisionTree's `__sklearn_tags__` method sets `tags.input_tags.sparse = True`. However, it doesn't explicitly set `allow_nan`. Looking at the provided `_support_missing_values` function in the additional code, it uses `self.__sklearn_tags__().input_tags.allow_nan`. Without the parent's tags, we need to infer. Since the class does not explicitly support missing values (no `allow_nan=True` in tags), and given typical scikit-learn trees, `allow_nan` is likely False. Also, `self.monotonic_cst` is None, but the third condition requires `allow_nan` to be True. So `_support_missing_values` likely returns False.

   b. If `_support_missing_values` returns False, the function calls `assert_all_finite(X, ...)`. This checks for NaN or infinity. The input X is a list of lists with all finite numbers (no NaN or inf). So `assert_all_finite` passes without error. Then it returns `None`.

   c. If `_support_missing_values` returns True (which it doesn't in this case), it would compute the overall sum and check for NaN. Even if it did, since X has no NaN, it would return `None` as well.

3. Therefore, the output is `None`.

4. The structure expects a JSON with key "output" and value XXX. Since the return value is `None`, in JSON we represent it as `null`.
