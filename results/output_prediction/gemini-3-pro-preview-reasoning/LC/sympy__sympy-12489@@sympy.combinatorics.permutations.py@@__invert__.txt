[THOUGHT]
The `__invert__` method is called on a `Permutation` object. The input state shows `_array_form` is `null` and `_size` is `5`. In the context of symbolic mathematics libraries like SymPy, a permutation with a defined size but no explicit array form typically defaults to the identity permutation. Only the identity permutation of size 5 corresponds to the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The `_af_invert` function calculates the inverse of this array, which remains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (since the identity permutation is its own inverse). The method then returns a new `Permutation` instance created via `_af_new` with this resulting array and size.
