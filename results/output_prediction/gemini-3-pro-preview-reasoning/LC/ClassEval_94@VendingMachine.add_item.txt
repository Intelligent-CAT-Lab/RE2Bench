1.  **Initialize**: The function `add_item` is called on an instance of `VendingMachine`. The current state `self` has an `inventory` containing `{"Coke": {"price": 1.25, "quantity": 20}}`. The arguments passed are `item_name="Coke"`, `price=1.25`, and `quantity=10`.

2.  **Execution - Step 1**: Inside `add_item`, the line `if not self.restock_item(item_name, quantity):` is executed. This calls `self.restock_item("Coke", 10)`.

3.  **Execution - Step 2**: Inside `restock_item`, the code checks `if item_name in self.inventory:`. Since "Coke" is a key in the `inventory` dictionary provided in the input, this condition acts as True.

4.  **Execution - Step 3**: The code executes `self.inventory[item_name]['quantity'] += quantity`. The current quantity is 20, adding 10 makes it 30. The inventory is updated.

5.  **Execution - Step 4**: `restock_item` returns `True`.

6.  **Execution - Step 5**: Back in `add_item`, the condition evaluates `not True`, which is `False`. Consequently, the body of the `if` statement (which would create a new entry) is skipped.

7.  **Execution - Step 6**: The function `add_item` reaches the end of its code block. Since there is no explicit `return` statement, Python functions return `None` by default.

8.  **Output Generation**: The return value is `None`. In JSON, this is represented as `null`.
