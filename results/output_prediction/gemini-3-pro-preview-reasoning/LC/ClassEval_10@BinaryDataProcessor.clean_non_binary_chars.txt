To determine the output of the function `clean_non_binary_chars`, we simulate the code execution.

1.  **Initialize State**: The object `self` is initialized with the attribute `binary_string` set to `"01101000011011010110001001101111"`.
2.  **Function Call**: The method `clean_non_binary_chars(self)` is called.
3.  **Filtering**: Inside the method, the line `self.binary_string = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string))` is executed.
    *   The `filter` function iterates over the input string.
    *   The lambda condition `x in '01'` checks if each character is either '0' or '1'.
    *   The input string `"01101000011011010110001001101111"` contains only '0's and '1's.
    *   Therefore, all characters are kept.
    *   `''.join(...)` reconstructs the string, resulting in `"01101000011011010110001001101111"`.
4.  **Assignment**: `self.binary_string` is updated with this value (which happens to be identical to the original).
5.  **Return Value**: The method execution reaches the end. There is no explicit `return` statement. In Python, if a function ends without a return statement, it implicitly returns `None`.
6.  **Output**: The prompt asks for the output of the function call, which is the return value. The JSON representation of Python's `None` is `null`.
