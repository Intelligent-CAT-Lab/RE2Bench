[THOUGHT]
1. Represents the initial state of the object: `self.inventory` is `{'book1': 2, 'book2': 1}`.
2. The method `add_book` is called with argument `title="book2"`.
3. The `quantity` argument is not provided in `args` or `kwargs`, so it defaults to `1`.
4. The method checks `if title in self.inventory`. `title` is "book2", which exists in the keys of `self.inventory`. The condition is `True`.
5. The method executes the `if` block: `self.inventory[title] += quantity`.
6. `self.inventory["book2"]` was `1`. Adding `1` makes it `2`. The inventory is now `{'book1': 2, 'book2': 2}`.
7. The method reaches the end of execution. There is no `return` statement provided in `add_book`.
8. In Python, a function without an explicit return statement returns `None`.
9. The JSON representation of Python's `None` is `null`.
