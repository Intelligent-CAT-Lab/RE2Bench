Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with the argument `nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
2. `count = len(nums)` is calculated. Since there are 5 elements in the list, `count` becomes 5.
3. The loop `for num in range(2, count):` is set up. `range(2, 5)` includes integers 2, 3, and 4. The loop will execute 3 times.
4. **Iteration 1 (`num` = 2):** `nums.sort()` is executed. The list `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]` is already in ascending order (-8 < -7 < -6 < -5 < 2). Sorting it in-place results in `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
5. **Iteration 2 (`num` = 3):** `nums.sort()` is executed again. The list remains `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
6. **Iteration 3 (`num` = 4):** `nums.sort()` is executed again. The list remains `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.
7. The loop finishes execution.
8. The function returns `nums`.
