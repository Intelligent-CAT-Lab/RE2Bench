[THOUGHT]
The function `precision_recall_curve` is called with the following arguments derived from the input JSON:
- `y_true`: `None` (from `"y_true": null`)
- `probas_pred`: `None` (from `"probas_pred": null`)
- `pos_label`: `1`
- `sample_weight`: `None`

Execution flow:
1. `precision_recall_curve(None, None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None)` calls `_binary_clf_curve(None, None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None)`.
2. Inside `_binary_clf_curve`, the first operation is `y_type = type_of_target(y_true)`, which translates to `type_of_target(None)`.
3. Inside `type_of_target(y)` where `y` is `None`:
    - It validates the input `y` using the condition: `valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str))`.
    - `None` is not an instance of `Sequence` (from `collections.abc`), nor `spmatrix`, and does not have the `__array__` attribute. Thus, `valid` evaluates to `False`.
    - The code then checks `if not valid:` which matches.
    - It raises a `ValueError` with the message: `'Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y`.
    - Substituting `y=None`, the message becomes: `'Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None'`.

Since the function execution terminates with an exception, the predicted output reflects this error.
