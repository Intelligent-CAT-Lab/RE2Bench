Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Parsing**: The function `simplify` receives two arguments, `x` and `n`. According to the input JSON, `x` is `"7/2"` and `n` is `"4/2"`.

2.  **Splitting `x`**:
    *   The line `a, b = x.split('/')` executes.
    *   `"7/2"` is split into `a = "7"` and `b = "2"`.

3.  **Splitting `n`**:
    *   The line `c, d = n.split('/')` executes.
    *   `"4/2"` is split into `c = "4"` and `d = "2"`.

4.  **Calculating `numerator`**:
    *   The code is `numerator = int(a) * int(c)`.
    *   `int(a)` converts "7" to number 7.
    *   `int(c)` converts "4" to number 4.
    *   `numerator` becomes $7 \times 4 = 28$.

5.  **Calculating `denom`**:
    *   The code is `denom = int(b) * int(d)`.
    *   `int(b)` converts "2" to number 2.
    *   `int(d)` converts "2" to number 2.
    *   `denom` becomes $2 \times 2 = 4$.

6.  **Comparison Logic**:
    *   The if condition checks: `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)`.
    *   `numerator / denom` calculates $28 / 4$, which results in the float `7.0`.
    *   `int(numerator / denom)` converts `7.0` to the integer `7`.
    *   The comparison `7.0 == 7` evaluates to `True`.

7.  **Return**:
    *   Since the condition is met, the function returns `True`.
