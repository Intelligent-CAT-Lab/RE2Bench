Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input variables**: `s = "."`, `n = 0`, `c = "99"`.
2.  **Calculate width**: The code calculates `width = len(c) * n`.
    *   `len(c)` is `len("99")`, which is 2.
    *   `n` is 0.
    *   So, `width = 2 * 0 = 0`.
3.  **Determine loop range**: The loop iterates over `range(width - len(s))`.
    *   `len(s)` is `len(".")`, which is 1.
    *   The argument to `range` is `0 - 1 = -1`.
    *   In Python, `range(-1)` (equivalent to `range(0, -1)`) yields an empty sequence because the stop value is less than the start value with a default step of 1.
4.  **Execute loop**: Since the range is empty, the body of the loop (`s = c + s`) is never executed.
5.  **Return**: The function returns the current value of `s`, which is still ".".
