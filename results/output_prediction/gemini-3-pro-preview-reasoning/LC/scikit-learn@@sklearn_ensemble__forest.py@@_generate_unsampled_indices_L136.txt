[THOUGHT]
1.  **Function Call:** The function `_generate_unsampled_indices` is called with arguments `random_state=209652396`, `n_samples=150`, and `n_samples_bootstrap=150`.
2.  **Internal Call - Sampling:** It invokes `_generate_sample_indices(random_state, n_samples, n_samples_bootstrap)`.
3.  **Random State Initialization:** Inside `_generate_sample_indices`, `check_random_state(209652396)` creates a NumPy `RandomState` instance seeded with `209652396`. This ensures deterministic behavior for the random number generation using the legacy MT19937 algorithm.
4.  **Generating Indices:** `random_instance.randint(0, 150, 150, dtype=np.int32)` generates an array of 150 integers, where each integer is uniformly distributed between 0 and 149 (inclusive). This represents the bootstrap sample (with replacement).
5.  **Counting:** Back in `_generate_unsampled_indices`, `np.bincount(sample_indices, minlength=150)` counts the occurrences of each integer from 0 to 149 in the generated sample.
6.  **Masking:** `unsampled_mask = sample_counts == 0` identifies which indices from 0 to 149 were *not* selected in the bootstrap sample.
7.  **Result Extraction:** `unsampled_indices = indices_range[unsampled_mask]` selects the indices where the mask is True.
8.  **Output Prediction:** Statistically, for a bootstrap sample of size $N$ from a population $N$, approximately $1/e \approx 36.8\%$ of samples are left out. For $N=150$, we expect around 55 unsampled indices. Executing the specific `RandomState(209652396).randint(0, 150, 150)` yields a specific set of indices.
    *Simulation of the random draw (deterministic with seed 209652396):*
    The sampled indices would be generated. Indices *not* in that set are returned.
    The resulting list is a sorted list of integers.
