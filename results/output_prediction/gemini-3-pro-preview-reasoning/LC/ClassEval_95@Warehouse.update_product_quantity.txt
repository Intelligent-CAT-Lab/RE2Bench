[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `update_product_quantity` method.

1.  **Initialize the object state (`self`)**:
    The input specifies `self.inventory` as:
    ```python
    {
        "1": {
            "name": "product 1",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    }
    ```
    Note that the key in the dictionary is the string `"1"`.

2.  **Identify arguments**:
    - `product_id`: `1` (integer)
    - `quantity`: `-3` (integer)

3.  **Trace execution**:
    - Call `update_product_quantity(1, -3)`.
    - Line: `if product_id in self.inventory:`
        - We check if the integer `1` is a key in `self.inventory`.
        - The keys of `self.inventory` are strings (specifically `"1"`).
        - In Python, `1` (int) is not equal to `"1"` (str), so `1 in {"1": ...}` evaluates to `False`.
    - Since the condition is `False`, the code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.
    - Even if the key match was successful (e.g., if `product_id` was `"1"`), this method modifies `self.inventory` in place (updating quantity from 2 to -1) but does not contain a `return` statement.
    - In Python, a function with no explicit `return` statement returns `None` by default.

4.  **Determine Output**:
    - The return value is `None`.
    - In the JSON output format, Python's `None` is represented as `null`.
