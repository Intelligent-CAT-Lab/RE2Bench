Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The code reads input and splits it by the character '.'. The input is "2.4".
2. `num` becomes `['2', '4']`.
3. The first condition checks `int(num[0][-1]) == 9`. `num[0]` is "2". The last character is "2". `int("2")` is 2. $2 == 9$ is False.
4. The second condition (elif) checks `int(num[1][0]) >= 5`. `num[1]` is "4". The first character is "4". `int("4")` is 4. $4 >= 5$ is False.
5. Since both previous conditions failed, the code enters the `else` block.
6. `print(num[0])` is executed. `num[0]` is "2".
7. The output is "2".
