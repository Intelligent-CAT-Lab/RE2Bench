[THOUGHT]
The function `__eq__` checks for equality between `self` and `other`.
1. The first check is `other.__class__ is self.__class__`.
2. `self` is an instance of `IndirectReference`.
3. `other` is provided in the input args as `[1, 2]`, which is a Python `list`.
4. Therefore, `other.__class__` is `type(list)` and `self.__class__` is `IndirectReference`.
5. Since these classes are different, the expression `other.__class__ is self.__class__` evaluates to `False`.
6. Due to the boolean `and` operator, the execution short-circuits and returns `False` immediately without evaluating the rest of the expression.
