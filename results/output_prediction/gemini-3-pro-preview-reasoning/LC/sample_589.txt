Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with argument `num` set to `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
2. The code accesses the last element of the list using `num[-1]`. The last element of `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]` is `1`.
3. This value `1` is appended to the end of the list `num`.
4. The list `num` becomes `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1]`.
5. The function returns the modified list.
