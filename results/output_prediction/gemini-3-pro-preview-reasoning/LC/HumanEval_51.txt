[THOUGHT]
The function `remove_vowels` iterates through each character in the input string `text`.
It filters out characters where `s.lower()` is present in the list `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`.
Essentially, it removes case-insensitive vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and keeps everything else, including consonants, punctuation, and whitespace (like newlines).

Input `text`: "abcdef\nghijklm"

Let's process character by character:
1. 'a': vowel, removed.
2. 'b': consonant, kept.
3. 'c': consonant, kept.
4. 'd': consonant, kept.
5. 'e': vowel, removed.
6. 'f': consonant, kept.
7. '\n': newline, not in vowel list, kept.
8. 'g': consonant, kept.
9. 'h': consonant, kept.
10. 'i': vowel, removed.
11. 'j': consonant, kept.
12. 'k': consonant, kept.
13. 'l': consonant, kept.
14. 'm': consonant, kept.

Resulting characters joined: "bcdf" + "\n" + "ghjklm" -> "bcdf\nghjklm"
