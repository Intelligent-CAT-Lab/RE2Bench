Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` is invoked with arguments: `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` and `p = 6`.
2. The variable `prev_p` is initialized to `p - 1`. So, `prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5`.
3. The code checks if `prev_p < 0`. Since `5 < 0` is `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
4. The function returns `nums[prev_p]`, which is `nums[5]`.
5. The list `nums` is 0-indexed:
   - Index 0: 6
   - Index 1: 8
   - Index 2: 2
   - Index 3: 5
   - Index 4: 3
   - Index 5: 1
6. Thus, `nums[5]` corresponds to the value `1`.
