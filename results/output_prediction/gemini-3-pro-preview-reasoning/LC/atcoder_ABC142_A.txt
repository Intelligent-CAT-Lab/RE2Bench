xecuting the code step by step:

1.  **Input Reading**: The program reads the input string. The provided input is `"99"`.
    `N = int("99")` results in `N` being the integer 99.

2.  **Conditional Check**: The code checks `if N % 2 == 0`.
    `99 % 2` equals `1`.
    `1 == 0` is `False`.
    Therefore, the code proceeds to the `else` block.

3.  **Calculation**: The statement is `print((N + 1) / N / 2)`.
    Substituting `N = 99`:
    Calculation: `(99 + 1) / 99 / 2`
    Simplify parenthesis: `100 / 99 / 2`
    
    Operations are performed from left to right for division:
    First: `100 / 99`. Mathematically, this is $1.010101...$.
    In standard double-precision floating-point arithmetic (used by Python), `100 / 99` is approximately `1.0101010101010102`.
    
    Second: The result is divided by 2.
    `1.0101010101010102 / 2` results in `0.5050505050505051`.

4.  **Output**: The function `print()` outputs this floating-point number.
