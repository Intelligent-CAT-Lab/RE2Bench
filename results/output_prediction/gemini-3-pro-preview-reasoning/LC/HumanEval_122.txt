Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `add_elements` takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.
2.  The input arguments are `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `k = 4`.
3.  The expression `arr[:k]` creates a slice of the first `k` elements of `arr`. Since `k` is 4, the slice is `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.
4.  The generator logic iterates over this slice: `(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)`.
    *   First element `111`: converted to string `"111"`, length is 3. `3 <= 2` is False. Ignored.
    *   Second element `21`: converted to string `"21"`, length is 2. `2 <= 2` is True. Included.
    *   Third element `3`: converted to string `"3"`, length is 1. `1 <= 2` is True. Included.
    *   Fourth element `4000`: converted to string `"4000"`, length is 4. `4 <= 2` is False. Ignored.
5.  The filtered values to be summed are `21` and `3`.
6.  The function calls `sum()` on these values: `21 + 3 = 24`.
7.  The function returns `24`.
