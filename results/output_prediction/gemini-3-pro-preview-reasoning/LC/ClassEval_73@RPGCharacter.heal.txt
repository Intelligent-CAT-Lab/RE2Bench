My thought process is as follows:
1.  **Initialize the object state**: Based on the input JSON, the `RPGCharacter` instance has `self.hp` initially set to 100.
2.  **Execute the `heal` method**:
    *   `self.hp += 10`: The current HP (100) is increased by 10, resulting in 110.
    *   `if self.hp > 100`: The code checks if the new HP (110) is greater than 100. This condition evaluates to True.
    *   `self.hp = 100`: Inside the if block, `self.hp` is set back to 100 (capping the health value).
    *   `return self.hp`: The method returns the current value of `self.hp`, which is 100.
