[THOUGHT]
The execution of the `check_in` method proceeds as follows:
1. **Initialize State**: The `self` object is initialized with `booked_rooms = {'single': {}}`.
2. **Method Call**: `check_in(room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1")` is called.
3. **Condition 1**: `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`
   - `room_type` is `"single"`.
   - `self.booked_rooms.keys()` contains `"single"`.
   - The condition is `False`. The code proceeds to the next step.
4. **Condition 2**: `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`
   - `self.booked_rooms["single"]` is `{} ` (an empty dictionary).
   - `name` is `"guest 1"`.
   - `"guest 1"` is not in `{}`.
   - The condition is `False`.
5. **Flow Control**: Since the condition is false, the indented block performing logic (checking room numbers, popping from dict) is skipped.
6. **Return**: The function execution reaches the end of the method body. In Python, if a function ends without an explicit `return` statement, it returns `None`.
7. **Representation**: The JSON representation of Python's `None` is `null`.
