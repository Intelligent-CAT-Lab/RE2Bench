[THOUGHT]
The function `__format_line_feed` takes a text input and uses the regular expression `\\n+` (which interprets as looking for one or more newline characters) to replace sequences of multiple newlines with a single newline character.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The input string is `text = "Some sentence here."`.
2. The regular expression `re.compile('\\n+')` looks for one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`).
3. The method `re.sub` is called to replace any matches found in the text with a single `\n`.
4. Inspecting the input string `"Some sentence here."`, there are no newline characters present.
5. Since no matches are found, the substitution function returns the original string unmodified.
6. The return value is `"Some sentence here."`.
