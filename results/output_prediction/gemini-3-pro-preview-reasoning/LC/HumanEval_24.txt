[THOUGHT]
The function `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` and finds the largest integer less than `n` that divides `n` evenly.

1.  **Input:** The function is called with `n = 3`.
2.  **Range Generation:** `range(n)` creates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`. For `n=3`, `range(3)` produces `[0, 1, 2]`.
3.  **Reversal:** `reversed(range(3))` reverses this sequence, resulting in an iterator that yields `2`, then `1`, then `0`.
4.  **Loop Execution:**
    *   **Iteration 1:** `i = 2`. We check `if n % i == 0` (i.e., `3 % 2 == 0`).
        *   $3 \div 2$ is 1 with a remainder of 1.
        *   The condition is `False`.
    *   **Iteration 2:** `i = 1`. We check `if n % i == 0` (i.e., `3 % 1 == 0`).
        *   $3 \div 1$ is 3 with a remainder of 0.
        *   The condition is `True`.
    *   **Return:** The function immediately returns `i`, which is `1`.

Note: The loop would technically continue to 0 where a division by zero error would occur, but since 1 divides every integer, the function always returns before reaching 0 for any $n > 1$.

5.  **Result:** The return value is `1`.
