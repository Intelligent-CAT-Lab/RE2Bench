[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize**: `ZipFileProcessor` is initialized with `file_name=""` (an empty string).
2.  **Call Method**: `extract_all` is called with `output_path=""`.
3.  **Try Block Execution**:
    *   The code attempts to execute `with zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r') as zip_file:`.
    *   `self.file_name` is `""`.
    *   Trying to open a file with an empty string as a name typically raises a `FileNotFoundError` (or potentially a specialized `zipfile.BadZipFile` error or similar depending on implementation details, but ultimately an exception). The standard Python `open("", 'rb')` (used internally by zipfile) raises `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''`.
4.  **Exception Handling**:
    *   The exception raised in the `try` block causes the control flow to jump immediately to the `except:` block.
5.  **Return Value**:
    *   Inside the `except` block, the function returns `False`.
6.  **Result**: The output is boolean `False`.
