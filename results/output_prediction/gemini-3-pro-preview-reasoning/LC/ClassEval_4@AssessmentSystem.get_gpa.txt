[THOUGHT]
The flow of execution is as follows:
1.  The `AssessmentSystem` class contains a dictionary `students` populated with data for "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie".
2.  The method `get_gpa` is called with the argument `name="Charlie"`.
3.  The code checks `if name in self.students`. "Charlie" exists in the `students` dictionary.
4.  The code checks `if self.students[name]['courses']`. The courses dictionary for Charlie is `{"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}`, which is not empty, so this condition evaluates to True.
5.  The code calculates the sum of the course grades: `sum(self.students["Charlie"]['courses'].values())`. The values are 70 and 80. Sum = 70 + 80 = 150.
6.  The code calculates the number of courses: `len(self.students["Charlie"]['courses'])`. There are 2 courses.
7.  The GPA is calculated by division: 150 / 2 = 75.0.
8.  The function returns 75.0.
