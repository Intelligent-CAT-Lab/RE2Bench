[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the function `_cmp_name` given specific inputs.

1.  **Analyze the Inputs**:
    - `x` is the class `sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit`.
    - `y` is the class `sympy.core.numbers.Pi`.
    - Both are standard SymPy classes inheriting from `Basic`.

2.  **Step-by-Step Execution**:
    - `n1 = x.__name__` -> `n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"`
    - `n2 = y.__name__` -> `n2 = "Pi"`
    - `if n1 == n2:` -> "ImaginaryUnit" != "Pi", condition False.
    - `if not issubclass(y, Basic):` -> `Pi` inherits from `Number` which inherits from `Basic`. `issubclass` is True. `not True` is False. Condition False.
    - `UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1` -> Since `ordering_of_classes` is not defined in the snippet, we must assume standard behavior or that these specific classes are not in the list. Usually, `ordering_of_classes` contains generic types like `Symbol`, `Add`, `Mul`. It does not typically contain singleton classes like `ImaginaryUnit` or `Pi` by name. If the variable is missing/empty, it behaves as if they are not found.
    - `try: i1 = ordering_of_classes.index(n1)` -> `index("ImaginaryUnit")` likely raises `ValueError`.
    - `except ValueError: i1 = UNKNOWN`.
    - `try: i2 = ordering_of_classes.index(n2)` -> `index("Pi")` likely raises `ValueError`.
    - `except ValueError: i2 = UNKNOWN`.
    - `if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN:` -> True.
    - `return (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)`
      - Comparison: "ImaginaryUnit" vs "Pi".
      - Alphabetically, 'I' (ASCII 73) comes before 'P' (ASCII 80).
      - `n1 > n2` ("ImaginaryUnit" > "Pi") is `False` (0).
      - `n1 < n2` ("ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi") is `True` (1).
      - Calculation: `0 - 1 = -1`.

3.  **Conclusion**:
    - The function returns -1.
