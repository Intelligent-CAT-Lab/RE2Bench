Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `is_simple_power` is called with arguments `x = 1` and `n = 1`.
2. The first line checks if `n == 1`.
3. Since `n` is indeed 1, the condition evaluates to `True`, and the program enters the `if` block.
4. Inside the `if` block, it returns the result of the comparison `x == 1`.
5. Since `x` is 1, `x == 1` evaluates to `True`.
6. The function returns `True`.
