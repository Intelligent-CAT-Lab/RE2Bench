[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to simulate the execution of the function `f` with specific inputs.

1.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   The function `f` is defined as `def f(array, elem):`.
    *   The input arguments provided are:
        *   `array`: `[6, 2, 7, 1]`
        *   `elem`: `6`

2.  **Step-by-Step Execution:**
    *   **Line 2:** `if elem in array:`
        *   Checks if `6` is present in the list `[6, 2, 7, 1]`.
        *   Since `6` is the first element, this condition evaluates to `True`.
    *   **Line 3:** `return array.index(elem)`
        *   This line executes because the condition was true.
        *   The method `.index(6)` search for the first occurrence of `6` in the list.
        *   The list is `[6, 2, 7, 1]`.
        *   Index 0 contains `6`.
        *   Therefore, `array.index(6)` returns `0`.

3.  **Result:**
    *   The function returns `0`.

4.  **Formatting:**
    *   Fill the placeholder `XXX` in the provided JSON structure with `0`.
