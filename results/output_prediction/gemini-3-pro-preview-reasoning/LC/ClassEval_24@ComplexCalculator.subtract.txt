[THOUGHT]
The function `subtract` is a static method that takes two inputs `c1` and `c2`. Based on the usage of properties `.real` and `.imag`, `c1` and `c2` are treated as Python complex number objects.
The input JSON provides `c1` as `"(-1+2j)"` and `c2` as `"(-3+4j)"`. These strings represent the complex numbers $c1 = -1 + 2i$ and $c2 = -3 + 4i$.

Step-by-step execution:
1.  **Extract real parts**:
    *   `c1.real` is -1.
    *   `c2.real` is -3.
    *   The line `real = c1.real - c2.real` calculates: $-1 - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2$.

2.  **Extract imaginary parts**:
    *   `c1.imag` is 2.
    *   `c2.imag` is 4.
    *   The line `imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag` calculates: $2 - 4 = -2$.

3.  **Construct result**:
    *   The line `return complex(real, imaginary)` creates a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -2.
    *   Mathematically, this is $2 - 2i$.
    *   In Python string representation, this is `(2-2j)`.

The function returns the complex object. The expected output format is its string representation.
