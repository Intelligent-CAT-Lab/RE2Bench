[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of `RegexUtils.split` with the inputs provided.

1.  **Analyze the Input**:
    *   **Function**: `re.split(pattern, text)` inside `RegexUtils.split`.
    *   **Pattern**: `"\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b"`. In Python string representation, this is `r"\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b"`. This regex matches a US phone number (3 digits, hyphen, 3 digits, hyphen, 4 digits) surrounded by word boundaries.
    *   **Text**: `"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`

2.  **Execute `re.split`**:
    *   `re.split` searches for the pattern in the string and uses it as a separator to split the string into a list of substrings.
    *   **Identify Matches**:
        1.  `"123-456-7890"` matches at the beginning of the string (indices 0-12).
        2.  `"876-286-9876"` matches in the middle (indices 24-36).
        3.  `"987-762-9767"` matches at the end of the string (indices 47-59).
    
    *   **Perform Splitting**:
        *   **Before Match 1**: The match is at the start (index 0). Since the match touches the start, `re.split` produces an empty string `""` as the first element.
        *   **Between Match 1 and Match 2**: The text between the end of the first phone number and the start of the second is `" abiguygusu "`.
        *   **Between Match 2 and Match 3**: The text between the end of the second phone number and the start of the third is `" kjgufwycs "`.
        *   **After Match 3**: The match ends at the very end of the string. Since the match touches the end, `re.split` produces an empty string `""` as the last element.

3.  **Construct Output**:
    The result is a list of these segments: `['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']`.
