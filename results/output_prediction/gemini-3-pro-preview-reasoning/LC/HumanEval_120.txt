Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `maximum` is invoked with arguments `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.
2.  **Base Case Check**: The code checks `if k == 0`. Since `k` is 2, this condition is false, and execution continues.
3.  **Sorting**: The method `arr.sort()` is called. This sorts the list in-place in ascending order.
    *   The input list is `[-4, 4]`.
    *   Since -4 is less than 4, the order remains `[-4, 4]`.
4.  **Slicing**: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[-k:]`.
    *   `k` is 2, so the slice is `arr[-2:]`.
    *   In Python, a negative slice index of `-2` implies starting from the second-to-last element.
    *   Since the list `arr` has exactly 2 elements, the slice starts at the beginning (index 0) and includes everything up to the end.
    *   `ans` becomes `[-4, 4]`.
5.  **Return**: The function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.
