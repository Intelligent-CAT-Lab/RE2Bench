[THOUGHT]
The function `setup` is called with an `app` object.
Inside the function, there are five calls to `app.add_transform(...)` which register various transform classes (`PreserveTranslatableMessages`, `Locale`, etc.). These are side effects on the `app` object.
After these calls, the function returns a dictionary literal: `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.
The return value does not depend on the input `app` or any calculations; it is a static dictionary.
Therefore, the output will directly correspond to this dictionary.
"version" is "builtin".
"parallel_read_safe" is `True` (JSON `true`).
"parallel_write_safe" is `True` (JSON `true`).
