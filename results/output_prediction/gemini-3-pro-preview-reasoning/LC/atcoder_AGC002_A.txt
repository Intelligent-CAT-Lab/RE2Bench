In this logic puzzle, we simulate the execution of the Python code with the provided inputs.

1.  **Input Parsing**: The input string `"1 1000000000"` is split by spaces into `['1', '1000000000']`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these strings into integers.
    *   `a = 1`
    *   `b = 1000000000`

2.  **First Condition**: `if a <= 0 and 0 <= b:`
    *   Check `a <= 0`: `1 <= 0` is **False**.
    *   Since the first part of the `and` statement is False, the entire condition is **False**.

3.  **Second Condition**: `elif a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0:`
    *   Check `a < 0`: `1 < 0` is **False**.
    *   Since the first part is False, the entire condition is **False**.

4.  **Else Block**:
    *   Since both previous conditions evaluated to False, the code falls through to the `else` block.
    *   The statement `print('Positive')` is executed.

6.  **Final Output**: The script prints `Positive`.
