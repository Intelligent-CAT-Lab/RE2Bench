[THOUGHT]
The user input provided is `1 1`. I need to simulate the execution of the Python code with this input.

1.  **Read Input**: The `input()` function reads the string `"1 1"`.
2.  **Split**: `.split()` is called on the string `"1 1"`. By default, it splits by whitespace.
    `x` becomes `['1', '1']`.
3.  **Convert to Int**: A loop iterates over the list `x`.
    -   For `i=0`: `x[0]` becomes `int('1')` which is `1`.
    -   For `i=1`: `x[1]` becomes `int('1')` which is `1`.
    Now, `x` is `[1, 1]`.
4.  **Assign Variables**:
    -   `a = x[0]` sets `a` to `1`.
    -   `b = x[1]` sets `b` to `1`.
5.  **Print Minimum**: `min(x)` finds the minimum value in `[1, 1]`, which is `1`.
    `print(1, end=' ')` prints `1` followed by a space.
    Current Output: `1 `
6.  **Condition Check**:
    -   Calculate difference: `a - b` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
    -   Absolute difference: `abs(0)` is `0`.
    -   Check if `0 >= 2`. This evaluates to `False`.
7.  **Else Block**:
    -   The code goes to the `else` block.
    -   `print(0)` is executed. It prints `0` and a newline.
    -   This appends to the previous output.
    Final Output: `1 0`
