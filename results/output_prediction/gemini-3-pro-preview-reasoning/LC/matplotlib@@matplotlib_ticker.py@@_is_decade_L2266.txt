1.  **Analyze the Input**: The function `_is_decade` is called with:
    *   `x`: 1e-07 (a float representing $10^{-7}$)
    *   `base`: 10
    *   `rtol`: 1e-07

2.  **Execute `_is_decade`**:
    *   **Step 1**: `np.isfinite(x)` is checked. 1e-07 is a finite number. Proceed.
    *   **Step 2**: `x == 0.0` is checked. 1e-07 is not 0. Proceed.
    *   **Step 3**: Calculate `lx`:
        *   `lx = np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)`
        *   `lx = np.log(1e-07) / np.log(10)`
        *   Mathematically, $\log_{10}(10^{-7}) = -7$. In floating-point arithmetic, `lx` results in a value extremely close to -7.0 (e.g., -7.0 or -6.999999999999999...).
    *   **Step 4**: Determine comparison method. `rtol` is provided as 1e-07.
    *   **Step 5**: Execute `np.isclose(lx, np.round(lx), rtol=rtol)`:
        *   `np.round(lx)` rounds the value (approx -7.0) to the nearest integer, which is `-7.0`.
        *   `np.isclose` checks if `lx` is close to `-7.0` within the relative tolerance of `1e-07`.
        *   The floating-point error for `1e-07` (machine epsilon level, ~1e-16) is significantly smaller than the provided tolerance `1e-07`.
        *   Therefore, `lx` is considered close to the integer `-7.0`.
    *   **Step 6**: The function returns `True`.

3.  **Construct Output**:
    *   The return value is `True`. In JSON, this is represented as `true`.
