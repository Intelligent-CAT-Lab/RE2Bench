Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The class `CalendarUtil` is initialized with `self.events` containing one event dictionary.
2. The method `add_event` is called with an `event` argument (a dictionary).
3. Inside `add_event`, the line `self.events.append(event)` is executed. This adds the new event dictionary to the end of the `self.events` list.
4. The method finishes execution. There is no `return` statement in `add_event`.
5. In Python, a function without a return statement implicitly returns `None`.
6. Therefore, the output of the function call is `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
