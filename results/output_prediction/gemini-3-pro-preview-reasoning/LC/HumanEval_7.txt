The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that contain the given substring.

Input `strings` list: `["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"]`
Input `substring`: `"run"`

Let's check each string in the input list:
1.  **"grunt"**: Does it contain "run"? Yes (`g`**`run`**`t`). It is added to the result.
2.  **"trumpet"**: Does it contain "run"? No.
3.  **"prune"**: Does it contain "run"? Yes (`p`**`run`**`e`). It is added to the result.
4.  **"gruesome"**: Does it contain "run"? No (it has "rue", but not "run").

The final filtered list is `["grunt", "prune"]`.
