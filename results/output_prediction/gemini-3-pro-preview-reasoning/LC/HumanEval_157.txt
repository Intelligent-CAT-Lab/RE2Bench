[THOUGHT]
The function `right_angle_triangle` checks if three given side lengths (`a`, `b`, `c`) form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It returns `True` if the square of the length of any side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Given inputs:
- `a = 10`
- `b = 6`
- `c = 8`

Let's evaluate the expression:
`a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b`

1. Calculate squares:
   - `a * a` = 10 * 10 = 100
   - `b * b` = 6 * 6 = 36
   - `c * c` = 8 * 8 = 64

2. Evaluate the first condition:
   - `a * a == b * b + c * c`
   - `100 == 36 + 64`
   - `100 == 100` -> This is `True`.

3. Since the operators are connected by `or`, and the first condition is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True` (short-circuit evaluation). The function returns `True`.
