[THOUGHT]
1. The function `dup_l1_norm` calculates the L1 norm of a polynomial `f` over a domain `K`. The L1 norm is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.
2. The input `f` is `[1, 2]`, representing the polynomial $x + 2$.
3. The input `K` is `ZZ`, representing the integer domain.
4. The function checks if `f` is empty. It is not (`[1, 2]`).
5. It calls `dup_abs(f, K)`. This function effectively computes `[K.abs(c) for c in f]`.
   - `K.abs(1)` is `1`.
   - `K.abs(2)` is `2`.
   - The result is `[1, 2]`.
6. It then calls `K.sum([1, 2])`. This sums the elements starting from `K.zero` (which is `0`).
   - `sum([1, 2], start=0)` evaluates to `0 + 1 + 2 = 3`.
7. The function returns `3`.
