The input to the `sstr` function contains an object `expr` which has attributes `_array_form` (set to `null`) and `_size` (set to 6). These attributes correspond to the `sympy.combinatorics.permutations.Permutation` class. The attribute `_size` being 6 indicates it is a permutation of 6 elements. The `_array_form` being `null` in the JSON representation is likely a placeholder or indicates an identity permutation (default state) in the context of the input generation, so we assume it represents the Identity Permutation of size 6, i.e., `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The function `sstr` initializes a `StrPrinter` and calls `doprint(expr)`. The `doprint` method calls `_print(expr)`, which dispatches to `_print_Permutation` because `expr` is a `Permutation`.

Inside `_print_Permutation`:
1.  It checks `Permutation.print_cyclic`. In modern SymPy versions (consistent with the provided code using `Cycle` for printing), this defaults to `True`.
2.  The code executes: `s = Cycle(expr)(expr.size - 1).__repr__()[len('Cycle'):]`.
3.  `expr` is Identity of size 6. `Cycle(expr)` creates an empty `Cycle()`.
4.  `expr.size - 1` is 5.
5.  `Cycle()(5)` creates a Cycle containing the element 5 fixed: `Cycle(5)` check `Cycle.__call__` logic. It returns `Cycle(5)`.
6.  `repr(Cycle(5))` returns `'Cycle(5)'`.
7.  Slicing `[len('Cycle'):]` gives `'(5)'`.
8.  The subsequent logic (`last = s.rfind('(')` etc.) does not modify `'(5)'` as it's already in the desired format.
9.  The function returns `'(5)'`.

If `Permutation.print_cyclic` were `False`, it would return `'Permutation([], size=6)'`. However, the presence of the cyclic printing logic as the primary path in the provided code snippet, and the convention for `sstr` (string representation) to be compact, points to `(5)`. The notation `(5)` signifies an Identity permutation on the set $\{0, 1, \dots, 5\}$.
