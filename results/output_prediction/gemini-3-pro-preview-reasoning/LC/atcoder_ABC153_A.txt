Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The input "3447 629" is split by whitespace into two strings, "3447" and "629".
2. These strings are mapped to integers, assigning `h = 3447` and `a = 629`.
3. The expression `h / a` is evaluated. $3447 \div 629$ equals approximately $5.48$.
4. `math.ceil(5.48)` rounds the number up to the next integer, which is $6$.
5. The program prints `6`.
