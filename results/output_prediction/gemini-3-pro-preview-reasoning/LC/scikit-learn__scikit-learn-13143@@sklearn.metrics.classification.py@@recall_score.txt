[THOUGHT]
The function called is `recall_score` with the arguments `y_true` and `y_pred ` set to `None` (from JSON `null`), and `kwargs` `labels=None`, `average=None`. `pos_label` defaults to 1.

Step-by-step execution prediction:
1.  **`recall_score(y_true=None, y_pred=None, labels=None, pos_label=1, average=None)`** is called.
2.  Inside `recall_score`, it calls **`precision_recall_fscore_support`** with the same arguments (plus `warn_for=('recall',)`).
3.  Inside `precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true=None, y_pred=None, ...)`:
    *   It calls **`_check_targets(y_true=None, y_pred=None)`**.
4.  Inside `_check_targets(y_true=None, y_pred=None)`:
    *   It calls **`check_consistent_length(None, None)`**.
        *   `check_consistent_length` iterates over arguments, keeping only those that are not None.
        *   The list of lengths is empty. `uniques` is empty. The check passes.
    *   It calls **`type_of_target(y_true)`**, i.e., `type_of_target(None)`.
5.  Inside `type_of_target(y=None)`:
    *   It evaluates `valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str))`.
    *   `None` is not an instance of `Sequence` (it's not iterable/subscriptable in the way `collections.abc.Sequence` requires, nor is it a list/tuple).
    *   `None` is not an instance of `spmatrix`.
    *   `None` does not have the `__array__` attribute.
    *   Therefore, `valid` is `False`.
    *   The function raises a **`ValueError`** with the message: `'Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None'`.

Since the execution encounters an unhandled exception, this exception is the result.
