The execution of the code is simulated as follows:

1.  **Input processing**: The program reads the input string `"20 30"`.
2.  **Variable assignment**: The `input().split()` method splits the string into `['20', '30']`. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to integers. Consequently, variable `A` gets the value `20` and variable `B` gets the value `30`.
3.  **Calculation**: The program calculates `ans = A - 2 * B`. Substituting the values, `ans = 20 - 2 * 30`, which implies `ans = 20 - 60`, resulting in `ans = -40`.
4.  **Conditional logic**: The program checks `if ans < 0`. Since `-40` is less than `0`, the condition evaluates to true. Inside the `if` block, `ans` is reassigned to `0`.
5.  **Printing**: The program prints the final value of `ans`, which is `0`.
