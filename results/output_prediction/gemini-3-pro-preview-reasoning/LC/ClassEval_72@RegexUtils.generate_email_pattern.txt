Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The method `generate_email_pattern` is called on an instance of `RegexUtils`.
2. Inside the method, a variable `pattern` is assigned a string literal `pattern = '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
3. In Python strings, the sequence `\\` represents a single backslash character `\`.
   - The first part `\\b` becomes `\b` (literal backslash followed by 'b').
   - The middle part `\\.` becomes `\.` (literal backslash followed by dot).
   - The end part `\\b` becomes `\b`.
4. The resulting string in memory is: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`.
5. The function returns this string.
6. To allow this string to be valid in the JSON output format, backslashes must be escaped (i.e., `\` becomes `\\`).
   - The string value `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b` is represented in JSON as `"\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
}
```
