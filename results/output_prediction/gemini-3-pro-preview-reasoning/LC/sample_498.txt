[THOUGHT]
The function `f` modifies a list `nums` in place by inserting a value into it at a specific index using slice assignment.

1.  **Analyze the Inputs**:
    - `nums`: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
    - `idx`: `2`
    - `added`: `3`

2.  **Analyze Function Logic**:
    - The line `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` utilizes Python's slice assignment.
    - `(added,)` constitutes a tuple containing a single element: `(3,)`.
    - `nums[idx:idx]` addresses the slice at index `idx` (2) with length 0. This effectively targets the insertion point between the element at index 1 and the element currently at index 2.
    - Assigning an iterable (the tuple) to this empty slice inserts the contents of the iterable at that position without replacing existing elements.

3.  **Execute the Insertion**:
    - The original list is:
      Index 0: 2
      Index 1: 2
      Index 2: 3
      Index 3: 2
      Index 4: 3
      Index 5: 3
    - We insert `3` at index 2.
    - Elements before index 2 remain: `[2, 2]`
    - The new element is inserted: `[3]`
    - Elements starting from the original index 2 are shifted to the right: `[3, 2, 3, 3]`
    - The combined list becomes: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`

4.  **Confirm Output**:
    - The function returns the modified `nums` list.
    - Result: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
