Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input**: The function `f` is called with the argument `array` set to an empty list `[]`.

2.  **First Loop**: `while -1 in array:`
    *   The code checks if the integer `-1` exists in `[]`.
    *   The result is `False`. The loop body is skipped.

3.  **Second Loop**: `while 0 in array:`
    *   The code checks if the integer `0` exists in `[]`.
    *   The result is `False`. The loop body is skipped.

4.  **Third Loop**: `while 1 in array:`
    *   The code checks if the integer `1` exists in `[]`.
    *   The result is `False`. The loop body is skipped.

5.  **Return**: The function returns the `array` variable. Since no modifications were performed, the value is `[]`.
