[THOUGHT]
1. The function `_interval_contains_close` is called with arguments `interval=[0.001, 1.0]`, `val=0.2`, and `rtol=1e-10`.
2. `a` is assigned 0.001, and `b` is assigned 1.0.
3. The check `if a > b` (0.001 > 1.0) evaluates to `False`. The order of `a` and `b` remains `a=0.001`, `b=1.0`.
4. `rtol` is updated: `rtol = (b - a) * rtol` -> `(1.0 - 0.001) * 1e-10` -> `0.999 * 1e-10`. This is a very small number (approx 9.99e-11).
5. The function return expression is calculated: `a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol`.
   - `a - rtol` is approx `0.001 - 0.0000000000999`.
   - `b + rtol` is approx `1.0 + 0.0000000000999`.
   - The value to check is `val = 0.2`.
   - Since `0.001... <= 0.2 <= 1.0...`, the comparison evaluates to `True`.
6. The function returns `True`.
