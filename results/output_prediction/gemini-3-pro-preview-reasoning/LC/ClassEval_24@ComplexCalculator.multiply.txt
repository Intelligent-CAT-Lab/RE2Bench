[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `multiply` static method in the `ComplexCalculator` class.

1.  **Analyze the Inputs**:
    -   The `args` dictionary contains `c1` and `c2`.
    -   `c1` is provided as `"(-1-2j)"`. In Python, this represents a complex number with real part -1 and imaginary part -2.
    -   `c2` is provided as `"(-3-4j)"`. This represents a complex number with real part -3 and imaginary part -4.
    -   Although passed as strings in the JSON input representation, the code accesses `.real` and `.imag` attributes, implying these are verified `complex` objects during execution.

2.  **Trace Code Execution**:
    -   **Method**: `multiply(c1, c2)`
    -   **Attributes**:
        -   `c1.real = -1.0`, `c1.imag = -2.0`
        -   `c2.real = -3.0`, `c2.imag = -4.0`
    -   **Calculate Real Part**:
        -   Formula: `c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag`
        -   Substitution: `(-1.0 * -3.0) - (-2.0 * -4.0)`
        -   Calculation: `3.0 - 8.0 = -5.0`
        -   `real = -5.0`
    -   **Calculate Imaginary Part**:
        -   Formula: `c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real`
        -   Substitution: `(-1.0 * -4.0) + (-2.0 * -3.0)`
        -   Calculation: `4.0 + 6.0 = 10.0`
        -   `imaginary = 10.0`
    -   **Return Statement**:
        -   `return complex(real, imaginary)`
        -   Result: `complex(-5.0, 10.0)`

3.  **Format Output**:
    -   The result is a Python complex object.
    -   The string representation of `complex(-5, 10)` in Python is `"(-5+10j)"`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "(-5+10j)"        
}
```
