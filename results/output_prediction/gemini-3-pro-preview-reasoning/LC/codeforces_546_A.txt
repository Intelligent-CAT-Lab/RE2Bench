Let's execute the code step by step using the provided input.

**Step 1: Input Parsing**
The input string provided is effectively `1 1 1`.  
The code executes `k, n, w = map(int, input().strip().split())`.
- `input().strip()` receives `"1 1 1"`.
- `.split()` splits the string by whitespace into a list: `['1', '1', '1']`.
- `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to integers.
- Assignments: `k = 1`, `n = 1`, `w = 1`.

**Step 2: Initialization**
`sum = 0` is initialized to store the total cost of bananas.

**Step 3: Loop Execution**
The loop runs for `i` in `range(1, w + 1)`, which resolves to `range(1, 2)`.
- **Iteration 1 (i=1):**  
  `sum += k * i`  
  `sum = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`.

**Step 4: Conditional Check**
The code checks `if sum <= n:`.
- Substituting values: `if 1 <= 1:`.
- The condition is `True`.

**Step 5: Output Generation**
Since the condition is `True`, the code executes the `if` block:
`print(0)`

Since `sum` (total cost, 1) is less than or equal to `n` (money available, 1), the amount to borrow is 0.

[THOUGHT]
The input string "1 1 1" is parsed into integers k=1, n=1, w=1.
The variable `sum` accumulates the cost of buying `w` bananas where the `i`-th banana costs `i*k`.
Loop runs for i = 1 to 1.
i=1: sum = 0 + 1*1 = 1.
Check conditions: sum (1) <= n (1). This is True.
The program prints 0.
