Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `parse_music` is called with the argument `music_string = ".| .| .| .|"`.
2. A dictionary `note_map` is created: `{'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}`.
3. The string `music_string` is split by spaces using `.split(' ')`. The input string has single spaces between the notes.
   - `".| .| .| .|".split(' ')` results in the list `['.|', '.|', '.|', '.|']`.
4. The list comprehension iterates over these elements.
   - For the first element `'.|'`, `note_map['.|']` is looked up, which is `1`.
   - For the second element `'.|'`, `note_map['.|']` is looked up, which is `1`.
   - For the third element `'.|'`, `note_map['.|']` is looked up, which is `1`.
   - For the fourth element `'.|'`, `note_map['.|']` is looked up, which is `1`.
5. The resulting list is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
