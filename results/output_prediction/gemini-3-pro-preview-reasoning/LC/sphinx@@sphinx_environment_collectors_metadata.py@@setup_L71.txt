[THOUGHT]
1. The function `setup` is executed with the `app` object serving as the argument.
2. Inside the function, the line `app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector)` is executed. This calls the `add_env_collector` method on the app object, which instantiates the collector and enables it. This is a side effect and does not influence the specific values returned by `setup`.
3. The function then executes the return statement: `return {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.
4. This dictionary matches the structure required for the output.
5. Consequently, the value for "version" is "builtin", and both safety flags are `True`.
