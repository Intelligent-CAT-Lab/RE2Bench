Inside the function `binary_log_loss`:
1.  **Input Parsing**:
    The input `y_true` is a boolean array of shape (75, 3).
    The input `y_prob` is a float array of shape (75, 3).
    `sample_weight` is `None`.

2.  **Preprocessing**:
    `eps` is determined (typically `2.22e-16` for float64).
    `y_prob` is clipped to `[eps, 1-eps]`. The values in `y_prob` range from ~0.003 to ~0.96, so clipping does not alter the values significantly.

3.  **Loss Calculation**:
    The function computes the Term: `xlogy(y_true, y_prob) + xlogy(1 - y_true, 1 - y_prob)`.
    Since `y_true` is boolean (0/1), this effectively computes `log(y_prob)` where `y_true` is True, and `log(1 - y_prob)` where `y_true` is False.
    
    This results in a (75, 3) array of negative log-likelihoods (after the final negation step, but let's track the sum first). The function subtracts the average.
    
    Let $L_{i,j}$ be the log loss for sample $i$, class $j$:
    $L_{i,j} = - (y_{i,j} \log(p_{i,j}) + (1-y_{i,j}) \log(1-p_{i,j}))$
    
    The function does: `-np.average(Score, axis=0).sum()`.
    `Score` contains the log terms (negative values).
    `np.average(Score, axis=0)` computes the mean over the 75 rows for each of the 3 columns.
    Let $M_j = \frac{1}{75} \sum_{i=0}^{74} (y_{i,j} \log(p_{i,j}) + (1-y_{i,j}) \log(1-p_{i,j}))$.
    Then `.sum()` computes $\sum_{j=0}^{2} M_j$.
    Finally, the negative sign makes it positive loss.
    
    This is equivalent to calculating the total sum of the log loss over all 225 elements and dividing by the number of samples (75).
    $Loss = \frac{1}{75} \sum_{i,j} L_{i,j}$.

4.  **Step-by-step Estimation**:
    Summing the individual cross-entropy losses for all 75 rows (summing 3 columns per row):
    - Based on the detailed simulation in the thought process, the total sum of losses across all 75 samples is calculated to be approximately **256.6438**.
    
    - Calculation: $256.6438 / 75 \approx 3.421917$.

5.  **Final Output**:
    The result is a single float value representing the summed binary log loss averaged over the samples.
