The code checks if the input integer `n` is a power of 2 by continuously dividing it by 2 as long as it is even.

[THOUGHT]
1. `n` is initialized to `int("9")`, so `n = 9`.
2. The `while` loop checks the condition `n % 2 == 0`.
3. Calculating `9 % 2` gives `1`. Since `1 != 0`, the condition is false, and the loop body is skipped entirely.
4. The code reaches the `if` statement: `if n == 1`.
5. `n` is currently `9`. Since `9 != 1`, the condition is false.
6. The execution moves to the `else` block.
7. `print('NO')` is executed.
