To determine the output, we simulate the execution of the Python code with the provided input.

1.  **Read Input**: The code executes `input()`, which reads a line from the standard input. The JSON input provided is `"\"a\""`. Interpreting this value as the input string to the program, there is a potential ambiguity: exact string `"`a`"` versus the character `a`.
    *   If interpreted strictly as the string `"a"` (3 characters) in Python 3, `ord("\"a\"")` would raise a `TypeError` because `ord()` expects a string of length 1.
    *   If interpreted as Python 2 code, `input()` parses the string `"a"` as a valid Python string literal, resulting in the single character string `'a'`.
    *   If the extra quotes in the JSON input are formatting artifacts and the intended input is just the character `a`, `ord('a')` is valid.
    
    Given the logic of the code (incrementing a character code), the intention is clearly to process a single character. We proceed with the interpretation that the input is the character `'a'`.

2.  **Ordinal Conversion**: The function `ord('a')` is called. The ASCII/Unicode value for the lowercase letter `'a'` is `97`.

3.  **Increment**: The code adds 1 to the integer value: `97 + 1 = 98`.

4.  **Character Conversion**: The function `chr(98)` is called. The ASCII/Unicode value `98` corresponds to the lowercase letter `'b'`.

5.  **Print**: The function `print('b')` outputs the character `b` to the standard output.

[THOUGHT]
The code `print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))` reads a string from input, finds its Unicode code point using `ord`, increments it by 1, converts it back to a character using `chr`, and prints it. 
The input given in the JSON is `"\"a\""`. Interpreting the intended input as the single character `a`:
1. `input()` returns `'a'`.
2. `ord('a')` returns the integer `97`.
3. `97 + 1` equals `98`.
4. `chr(98)` returns the character `'b'`.
5. The program prints `b`.
