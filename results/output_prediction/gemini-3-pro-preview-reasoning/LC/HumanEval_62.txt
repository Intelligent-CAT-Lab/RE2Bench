Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `derivative` takes a list `xs` as input.
2.  The input `xs` is `[3, 2, 1, 0, 4]`.
3.  The list comprehension `[i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)]` iterates over `xs` with an index `i`.
    -   For `i = 0`, `x = 3`: `i * x = 0 * 3 = 0`
    -   For `i = 1`, `x = 2`: `i * x = 1 * 2 = 2`
    -   For `i = 2`, `x = 1`: `i * x = 2 * 1 = 2`
    -   For `i = 3`, `x = 0`: `i * x = 3 * 0 = 0`
    -   For `i = 4`, `x = 4`: `i * x = 4 * 4 = 16`
4.  The resulting list is `[0, 2, 2, 0, 16]`.
5.  Finally, the slice `[1:]` is applied, which removes the first element of the list.
6.  The list becomes `[2, 2, 0, 16]`.
7.  The function returns `[2, 2, 0, 16]`.
