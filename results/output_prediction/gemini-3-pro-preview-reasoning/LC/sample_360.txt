Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `f` is called with arguments `text = "g"` and `n = 15`.
2.  The first line checks the length of the string `text`. `len("g")` is 1.
3.   The condition `len(text) <= 2` is evaluated. Since 1 <= 2, the condition is `True`.
4.  The code enters the `if` block and executes `return text`.
5.   The function returns the original string `"g"`.
