Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Analyze the Input**: The function `f` is called with the argument `nums = [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
2.  **Determine List Length**: The length of the list `nums` is 7.
3.  **Determine Loop Range**: The loop `for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):` will iterate `7 - 1 = 6` times.
4.  **Execute Logic**:
    *   The `nums.reverse()` method reverses the list in place.
    *   Reversing a list twice brings it back to its original state (Identity operation).
    *   Since the loop runs 6 times, which is an even number, the list will be reversed 6 times.
    *   Iteration 1: List becomes reversed.
    *   Iteration 2: List becomes original.
    *   Iteration 3: List becomes reversed.
    *   Iteration 4: List becomes original.
    *   Iteration 5: List becomes reversed.
    *   Iteration 6: List becomes original.
5.  **Final State**: After 6 reversals, the list `nums` remains in its original order: `[1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3]`.
6.  **Return**: The function returns the list.
