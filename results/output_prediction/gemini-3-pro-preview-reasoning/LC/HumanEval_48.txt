The function iterates through the string "xywzx" comparing characters from the beginning and end, moving inwards. It checks if the character at index 0 matches index 4, which is true ('x' == 'x'). It then checks index 1 ('y') against index 3 ('z'), finds they are not equal, and immediately returns False.
