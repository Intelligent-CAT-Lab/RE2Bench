[THOUGHT]
The code performs the following steps:
1.  **`a, b = input().split()`**: Reads the input string `"982906996 135497281"`. The `.split()` method splits the string by the space character.
    *   `a` becomes the string `'982906996'`.
    *   `b` becomes the string `'135497281'`.
2.  **`b = int(b[::-1])`**:
    *   `b[::-1]` uses slice notation to reverse the string `b`.
    *   Reverse of `'135497281'` is `'182794531'`.
    *   `int(...)` converts this reversed string into an integer. So `b` becomes the integer `182794531`.
3.  **`print(int(a) + b)`**:
    *   `int(a)` converts `'982906996'` to the integer `982906996`.
    *   It adds `int(a)` and `b`: `982906996 + 182794531`.

    *   Calculation:
        ```
          982906996
        + 182794531
        -----------
        ```
        *   6 + 1 = 7
        *   9 + 3 = 12 (write 2, carry 1)
        *   9 + 5 + 1 = 15 (write 5, carry 1)
        *   6 + 4 + 1 = 11 (write 1, carry 1)
        *   0 + 9 + 1 = 10 (write 0, carry 1)
        *   9 + 7 + 1 = 17 (write 7, carry 1)
        *   2 + 2 + 1 = 5
        *   8 + 8 = 16 (write 6, carry 1)
        *   9 + 1 + 1 = 11

    *   The result is `1165701527`.
