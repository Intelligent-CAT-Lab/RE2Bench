The reasoning process leads to the conclusion that `n = 13441` is a prime number. The function checks for divisibility by iterating through integers starting from 2. Since 13441 has no divisors other than 1 and itself (it is prime), the condition `n % k == 0` will never be met inside the loop. Consequently, the loop will finish, and the function will return `True`.
