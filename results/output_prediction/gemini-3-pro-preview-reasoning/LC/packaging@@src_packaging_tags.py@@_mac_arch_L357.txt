[THOUGHT]
The function `_mac_arch` takes arguments `arch` and `is_32bit`.
From the input:
- `arch` is supplied as `"x86_64"`.
- `is_32bit` is supplied as `True`.

Step-by-step execution:
1. `if not is_32bit:`: Since `is_32bit` is `True`, `not is_32bit` is `False`. The code inside this block is skipped.
2. `if arch.startswith('ppc'):`: `arch` is `"x86_64"`. It does not start with `"ppc"`. This condition is `False`.
3. `return 'i386'`: The function execution reaches the final return statement, returning `"i386"`.
