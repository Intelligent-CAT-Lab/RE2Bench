[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize the object**: The input specifies an instance of `RPGCharacter` with attributes `name="John"`, `hp=100`, `attack_power=20`, `defense=10`, `level=1`, `exp=0`.
2.  **Call the method**: The method called is `is_alive` with no additional arguments.
3.  **Execute the logic**:
    *   The `is_alive` method executes `return self.hp > 0`.
    *   We check the value of `self.hp` from the input, which is `100`.
    *   The expression becomes `100 > 0`.
4.  **Determine the result**: Since 100 is greater than 0, the expression evaluates to `True`.
5.  **Format Output**: The output is a JSON boolean, so it maps to `true`.
