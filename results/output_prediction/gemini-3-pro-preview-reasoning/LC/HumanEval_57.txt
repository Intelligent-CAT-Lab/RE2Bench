[THOUGHT]
The function `monotonic` checks if the input list `l` is sorted either in ascending or descending order.

1.  **Input:** The list provided is `l = [9, 9, 9, 9]`.
2.  **First Check (`l == sorted(l)`):** The function first sorts `l` in ascending order. Since all elements are equal, `sorted([9, 9, 9, 9])` results in `[9, 9, 9, 9]`.
3.  **Comparison:** It compares the original list with the sorted list: `[9, 9, 9, 9] == [9, 9, 9, 9]`. This evaluates to `True`.
4.  **Logical OR:** Since the first condition matches, the `if` statement evaluates to true without checking the reverse sort condition (though that would also be true).
5.  **Return:** The function returns `True`.

In JSON format, the boolean `True` is represented as `true`.
