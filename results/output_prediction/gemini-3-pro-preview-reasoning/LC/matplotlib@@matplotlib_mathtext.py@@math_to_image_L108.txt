The function `math_to_image` takes a LaTeX string `s`, parses it using `MathTextParser`, creates a matplotlib figure of the exact size required to hold the rendered equation, places the text starting at the correct baseline offset, saves the image to `filename_or_obj`, and returns the `depth` (descent) of the rendered equation.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize Parser**: `parser = MathTextParser('path')` creates a parser that calculates vector path data and metrics for the math string.
2.  **Parse String**: `width, height, depth, _, _ = parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)` is called with `s="$x^2$"`.
    *   The string `$x^2$` consists of a base 'x' and a superscript '2'.
    *   In the default mathematical fonts (Computer Modern) used by Matplotlib, the lowercase 'x' sits on the baseline and does not have a descender (parts extending below the line like 'g', 'j', 'p', 'q', 'y').
    *   The superscript '2' is elevated above the baseline and also has no descender.
    *   Therefore, the lowest point of the glyphs aligns with the baseline.
    *   The `depth` (representing the distance from the baseline to the bottom of the bounding box) is `0`.
3.  **Create Figure**: `fig = figure.Figure(...)` initializes a figure with dimensions based on the parsed width and height.
4.  **Add Text**: `fig.text(0, depth / height, s, ...)` adds the text. Since `depth` is `0`, the vertical position is `0`.
5.  **Save Figure**: `fig.savefig(...)` is called to save the output.
6.  **Return**: The function returns `depth`, which determines the vertical offset of the baseline. Based on the analysis of `$x^2$`, this value is `0`.
