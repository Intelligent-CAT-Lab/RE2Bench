[THOUGHT]
The function `load_image` is defined as follows:
```python
    def load_image(self, image_path):
        self.image = Image.open(image_path)
```
1. The function takes `image_path` as an argument.
2. It attempts to open the image using `Image.open` and assigns the resulting image object to `self.image`.
3. The function does not contain a `return` statement.
4. In Python, a function without a return statement implicitly returns `None`.
5. In the requested JSON output format, Python's `None` is represented as `null`.

Therefore, the output of the function call is `null`.
