The user wants to predict the output of the function `_expand_partial_derivative` for the class `PartialDerivative`.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the Input:** The input JSON provides the state of `self` with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` set to `null`. It defines `args` and `kwargs` as empty dictionaries, which corresponds to the arguments of the function call `_expand_partial_derivative()`. The internal structure of `self` (specifically `_args`, which holds `expr` and `variables`) is not explicitly detailed in the input.

2.  **Analyze the Function:** The function `_expand_partial_derivative(self)` performs the following steps:
    *   Calls `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)` to calculate `args`, `indices`, `free`, and `dum`.
    *   Creates a new object `obj = self.func(*args)`.
    *   Manually sets `obj._indices`, `obj._free`, and `obj._dum` to the calculated values.
    *   Checks if the expression is zero (no free symbols). If not, it proceeds to expand. With `Tensor` objects or symbols, it typically returns `obj` or a modification of it.

3.  **Deduce Missing State:** Since the input `self` does not contain explicit tensor objects, ranks, or indices, and `_indices` is `null` (uncomputed), we must assume the default or scalar case implied by the prompt's context. A `PartialDerivative` without specified tensor indices typically represents a scalar derivative or a symbolic derivative with no tensor contractions.
    *   If `self.expr` is a scalar or a bare Symbol, it has no indices.
    *   If `self.variables` are scalars or empty, they contribute no indices or contractions.
    *   Therefore, `_contract_indices_for_derivative` will return empty lists for `indices` (results indices), `free` (free indices map), and `dum` (dummy/contraction indices).

4.  **Simulate Execution:**
    *   `_contract_indices_for_derivative` returns `indices=[]`, `free=[]`, `dum=[]`.
    *   `obj` is instantiated.
    *   `obj._indices` is set to `[]`.
    *   `obj._free` is set to `[]`.
    *   `obj._dum` is set to `[]`.
    *   The function returns `obj` (assuming the result isn't trivially zero, or strictly focusing on the attribute structure requested). The request asks for the attributes `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` of the resulting object.

5.  **Format Output:** The output structure requires these three attributes. Based on the deduction, they are all empty lists.

[THOUGHT]
The function `_expand_partial_derivative` is called on a `PartialDerivative` object `self`.
1. The method first calls `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)` to determine the indices, free indices, and dummy indices of the expression.
2. The input provided for `self` shows `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` initialized to `null`. The input does not explicitly show `_args`, which usually contains `expr` and `variables`.
3. In the absence of explicit tensor structure (ranks, indices) or variables in the input configuration, we assume the object represents a scalar expression or a state with no indices (rank 0).
4. Consequently, `_contract_indices_for_derivative` calculates that there are no indices to manage. It returns empty lists for `indices`, `free`, and `dum`.
5. The method creates a new object `obj` and assigns these empty lists to `obj._indices`, `obj._free`, and `obj._dum`.
6. The predicted values for these attributes are therefore empty lists `[]`.
