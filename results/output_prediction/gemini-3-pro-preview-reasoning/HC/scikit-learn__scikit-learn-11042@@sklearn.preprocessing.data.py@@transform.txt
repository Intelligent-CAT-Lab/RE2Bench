The `transform` method of `OneHotEncoder` processes the input `X` using the internal state of the fitted encoder.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize**: The class `OneHotEncoder` is considered with attributes provided in `self`. Key attributes are `n_values_=[4, 3, 2]`, `active_features_=[0, 3, 5, 6, 8]`, and `feature_indices_=[0, 4, 7, 9]`. `sparse` is True.
2.  **Input Parsing**: `transform` calls `_transform_selected`, which calls `_transform`. The input `X` is provided as `"[[1 1 1]]"`, which corresponds to a numpy array `[[1, 1, 1]]` (1 sample, 3 features).
3.  **Validation**: `check_array(X, dtype=np.int)` confirms the array is integers. `n_features` is 3, which matches `feature_indices_.shape[0] - 1` (4-1=3).
4.  **Bound Check**: The input values `[1, 1, 1]` are compared against `n_values_` `[4, 3, 2]`. Conditions `1<4`, `1<3`, `1<2` are all True. No errors given `handle_unknown="error"`.
5.  **Global Index Calculation**:
    *   Feature 0, Value 1: Base 0. Global Index = 0 + 1 = 1.
    *   Feature 1, Value 1: Base 4. Global Index = 4 + 1 = 5.
    *   Feature 2, Value 1: Base 7. Global Index = 7 + 1 = 8.
    *   The generated sparse matrix (before slicing) has ones at columns `1`, `5`, and `8`.
6.  **Slicing with Active Features**: The matrix is sliced using `out[:, self.active_features_]`.
    *   `active_features_` is `[0, 3, 5, 6, 8]`.
    *   The column `1` from the intermediate matrix is **not** in `active_features_`, so it is dropped.
    *   The column `5` is at index 2 of `active_features_`. It maps to column index 2 in the output.
    *   The column `8` is at index 4 of `active_features_`. It maps to column index 4 in the output.
7.  **Final Matrix Construction**:
    *   The resulting sparse matrix has non-zero elements at indices 2 and 4.
    *   Values are `1.0` (default float dtype).
    *   Shape is `(1, 5)`.
    *   `indices` array: `[2, 4]`.
    *   `indptr` array for 1 row with 2 elements: `[0, 2]`.
    *   `data` array: `[1., 1.]`.
    *   `maxprint` attribute is typically 50 for scipy sparse matrices.
