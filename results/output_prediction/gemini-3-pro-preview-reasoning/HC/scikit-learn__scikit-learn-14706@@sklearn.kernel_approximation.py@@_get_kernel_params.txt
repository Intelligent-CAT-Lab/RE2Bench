[THOUGHT]
1. The method `_get_kernel_params` is called on an instance of `Nystroem`.
2. `self.kernel_params` is `None`, so `params` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.
3. `self.kernel` is `"polynomial"`. This is a string (not callable) and not `"precomputed"`, so the code enters the `if` block to iterate over `KERNEL_PARAMS`.
4. `KERNEL_PARAMS["polynomial"]` specifically identifies the parameters used by the polynomial kernel. In standard scikit-learn (which this code mimics), these parameters are `["gamma", "degree", "coef0"]` (or similar order).
5. The loop iterates through these parameters:
    - **param = "gamma"**: `self.gamma` is `null` (None in Python). The condition `if getattr(self, param) is not None` is False. It is not added to `params`.
    - **param = "degree"**: `self.degree` is `3.1`. The condition is True. `params["degree"] = 3.1`.
    - **param = "coef0"**: `self.coef0` is `0.1`. The condition is True. `params["coef0"] = 0.1`.
6. The `elif` block is skipped because the `if` block was executed.
7. The function returns `params`, which is `{"degree": 3.1, "coef0": 0.1}`.
