[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the function `axis_aligned_extrema` method of the `BezierSegment` class.

1.  **Analyze the Input State**:
    The input JSON defines the state of the `BezierSegment` instance (`self`):
    -   `_N` (number of control points) is `1`.
    -   `_cpoints` is given as a string representation `"[[ 0.        , -2.48451997]]"`. This corresponds to a numpy array of shape (1, 2).
    -   `_d` (dimension) is `2`.

2.  **Execute `axis_aligned_extrema`**:
    -   The first line retrieves the degree of the curve: `n = self.degree`.
    -   The `degree` property is defined as `self._N - 1`.
    -   Subsituting the value from the input: `n = 1 - 1 = 0`.
    -   Next, the function checks the condition: `if n <= 1:`.
    -   Since `n` is 0, the condition `0 <= 1` evaluates to `True`.

3.  **Determine Function Return Value**:
    -   Inside the `if` block, the function returns: `(np.array([]), np.array([]))`.
    -   This represents a tuple containing two empty numpy arrays. This makes sense geometrically because a single point (degree 0) or a line segment (degree 1) has no internal axis-aligned extrema (excluding endpoints).

4.  **Format the Output**:
    -   The structure requires a JSON format.
    -   The return value is a Python tuple of two empty numpy arrays.
    -   In JSON, a tuple translates to a list, and an empty numpy array translates to an empty list.
    -   Therefore, the logical output is `[[], []]`.

5.  **Final Prediction**:
    The output variable `XXX` should be replaced with `[[], []]`.
