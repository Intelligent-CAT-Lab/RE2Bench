[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Input**: The user is calling `call_command` with `command_name='transaction'`, `kwargs={'stdout': {}, 'no_color': True}`.
2.  **Analyize the Function**: `call_command` in `django.core.management` handles the execution of management commands.
3.  **Step-by-Step Execution**:
    *   `call_command` starts.
    *   It checks `isinstance(command_name, BaseCommand)`. Input is a string "transaction", so this is False.
    *   It calls `get_commands()` to resolve the command name to an app name.
    *   `get_commands()` (defined in snippets) scans `django.core` and installed apps for management commands.
    *   Standard Django commands include 'check', 'migrate', etc. 'transaction' is *not* a standard Django management command.
    *   The provided snippets include details for the `check` command (`django.core.management.commands.check.Command.add_arguments`), which suggests `check` might be available, but there is no definition or snippet for a `transaction` command.
    *   `get_commands()` returns a dictionary of command names. Since 'transaction' is not found, accessing `get_commands()['transaction']` raises a `KeyError`.
    *   The `KeyError` is caught in `call_command`.
    *   `call_command` raises `CommandError('Unknown command: %r' % command_name)`.
    *   The format of the error message will be `Unknown command: 'transaction'`.
4.  **Formatting Output**: The question asks for the `output`. Since the function raises an exception and does not return a value, the output is best represented by the Exception string.
5.  **Conclusion**: The execution fails with a `CommandError` because 'transaction' is not a known command.
