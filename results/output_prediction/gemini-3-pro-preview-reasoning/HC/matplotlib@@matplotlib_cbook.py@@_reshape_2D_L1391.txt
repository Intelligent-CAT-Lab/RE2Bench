[THOUGHT]
The function `_reshape_2D(X, name)` is called with `X` being a string representation of a list of lists.
1.  **Input Parsing**: The input JSON provides `X` as a string: `"[[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409],[0.78306588, ...]]"`. In the context of this execution simulation, this string is interpreted as the Python object `X` (a list of lists of floats).
    `X` = `[[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409], [0.78306588, 0.97289726, 0.48320961], [0.33642111, 0.56741904, 0.04794151], [0.38893703, 0.90630365, 0.16101821], [0.74362113, 0.63297416, 0.32418002]]`

2.  **`_unpack_to_numpy(X)`**:
    -   `X` is a `list`.
    -   `isinstance(X, np.ndarray)` is False.
    -   It does not have `to_numpy` or `values` attributes.
    -   It is not a torch/jax/tf array.
    -   The function returns `X` (the list) as is.

3.  **Main Logic**:
    -   `if isinstance(X, np.ndarray):` Check is False (`X` is a list).
    -   `if len(X) == 0:` Check is False (len is 5).
    -   `result = []`
    -   `is_1d = True`
    -   The code iterates `for xi in X:`
        -   **Iteration 1**: `xi` = `[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409]` (list).
            -   `isinstance(xi, str)` is False.
            -   `try: iter(xi)` succeeds. `else: is_1d = False`. `is_1d` is now `False`.
            -   `xi = np.asanyarray(xi)` converts the list to a numpy array of shape (3,).
            -   `nd = np.ndim(xi)` is 1.
            -   `if nd > 1:` False.
            -   `result.append(xi.reshape(-1))` appends the array as a 1D array.
        -   **Iterations 2-5**: Repeat for remaining rows. Each row is converted to a 1D numpy array and appended to `result`.
    -   After loop, `is_1d` is `False`.
    -   `else:` (of `if is_1d`) block returns `result`.

4.  **Result**:
    -   The return value is a Python list containing 5 numpy arrays.
    -   Structure: `[array([...]), array([...]), array([...]), array([...]), array([...])]`.
    -   Since the input was a list of lists, `_reshape_2D` preserves the row structure (treating it as a list of datasets). Note: If `X` had been a 2D numpy array, the code would have transposed it (treating columns as datasets), but here it is a list.

5.  **Output Formatting**:
    -   The output structure requires filling `XXX`. Since the result contains numpy arrays (which are not standard JSON), the Python string representation (repr) of the result list is the expected output format.
