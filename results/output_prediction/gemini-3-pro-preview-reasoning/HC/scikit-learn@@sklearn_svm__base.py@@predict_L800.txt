Based on the provided `BaseSVC` class and the logic simulated for `predict` using `libsvm`'s OVO (One-vs-One) strategy:

1.  **Model Configuration**: The model is a Support Vector Classifier with an RBF kernel ($\gamma \approx 1.75$) and 3 classes (0, 1, 2).
2.  **Support Vectors and Coefficients**:
    *   **Class 0**: Support Vectors at [0.6, 0.5, 0.1]. These are well-separated from classes 1 and 2 (values $\ge 1.0$). Points near 0-0.6 belong to Class 0.
    *   **Class 1 vs Class 2**: These classes overlap in the range [1.0, 2.5].
    *   **Decision Boundary (1 vs 2)**:
        *   Net weights at support vectors were calculated.
        *   Significant weights: +2 at 1.5, +4 at 1.6 (favoring Class 1) versus -6.68 at 1.8, -1 at 1.4 (favoring Class 2).
        *   Calculations show the decision boundary ($S_{12} - \text{intercept} = 0$) lies between 1.5 and 1.6.
        *   $x=1.5$ yields a positive score (Class 1).
        *   $x=1.6$ yields a score slightly below zero (Class 2).
    *   **Other boundaries**:
        *   $x=1.4$ is Class 1.
        *   $x=1.8, 1.9, 2.x$ are Class 2.
        *   $x=1.0, 1.2, 1.3$ are Class 1.

3.  **Predictions for Input X**:
    *   Points $\approx 0.2, 0.3, 0.4$ -> **0**.
    *   Points $\approx 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5$ -> **1**.
    *   Points $\approx 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4$ -> **2**.
