The function `_common_new` is used to construct objects representing integrals (or sums/products) by processing the integrand and limits.

**Step-by-step Derivation:**

1.  **Parsing Inputs:**
    -   `function` argument is provided as `"1"`. The code executes `function = sympify(function)`. `sympify("1")` returns the SymPy integer `1` (`S.One`).
    -   `symbols` argument is provided as `["x"]`. When calling `_common_new`, these are passed as `*symbols`. Assuming standard behavior for such tests, "x" is treated as `Symbol('x')`. So `symbols` is a tuple `(Symbol('x'),)`.
    -   `discrete` is `False`.

2.  **Processing Limits:**
    -   The function calls `_process_limits(*symbols, discrete=discrete)`.
    -   Inside `_process_limits` with `symbols=(Symbol('x'),)` and `discrete=False`:
        -   It iterates over `symbols`. Let `V = Symbol('x')`.
        -   `V` is an instance of `Symbol`.
        -   It is not an `Idx` (unless specified, which it isn't).
        -   It creates a `Tuple` from the symbol: `Tuple(x)`.
        -   This tuple is appended to the `limits` list.
        -   The loop finishes.
        -   Should return `limits` and `orientation`. `limits` is `[Tuple(x)]`. `orientation` defaults to `1` and isn't changed for a single symbol.

3.  **Variable Substitution & Handling:**
    -   Back in `_common_new`:
        -   It checks if `symbols` was provided (It was).
        -   It iterates `limits`. The only limit is `(x,)` (length 1). The condition `len(li) == 4` is false.
    -   It enters a `while cls == type(function):` loop. `cls` is `Integral` and `type(function)` is `Integer`. They are not equal, so the loop is skipped. (This handles collapsing nested integrals).

4.  **Piecewise Folding:**
    -   The code prepares to handle `Piecewise` functions.
    -   `symbols_of_integration` is `{x}`.
    -   It checks for `Piecewise` atoms in `function`. `function` is `1`, so there are no `Piecewise` atoms.
    -   `piecewise_fold(1)` returns `1`.
    -   `xreplace` does nothing as `reps` is empty.
    
5.  **Return:**
    -   The function returns the tuple `(function, limits, orientation)`.
    -   `function` is `1`.
    -   `limits` is `[Tuple(x)]`. In SymPy string representation, `Tuple(x)` appears as `(x,)` and the list as `[(x,)]`.
    -   `orientation` is `1`.

6.  **Output Generation:**
    -   The return value is `(1, [(x,)], 1)`.
