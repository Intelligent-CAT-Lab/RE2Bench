The execution of the `FunctionUnitBase.to` method is simulated as follows:

1.  **Method Invocation**: The function `to` is called on the object `self` with arguments `other`, `value="2.5"`, and `equivalencies=null`.
    *   `self` is a `FunctionUnitBase` (likely a `FunctionUnit` or subclass like `MagUnit`/`LogUnit` instance) which wraps a physical unit (`meter`) and uses a function unit for its values.
    *   `value` is provided as "2.5". We treat this as the float `2.5`.

2.  **Physical Unit Check**:
    ```python
    if other is self.physical_unit:
        return self.to_physical(value)
    ```
    *   `self.physical_unit` is the unit "meter".
    *   `other` is an object representing unit "meter" with the identical hash (`2181990727224913881`).
    *   Thus, the condition `other is self.physical_unit` evaluates to **True**.

3.  **Execute `to_physical`**:
    The code branches to `return self.to_physical(value)`.
    *   Although `to_physical` is not explicitly shown in the provided snippet, `FunctionUnitBase` requires it (usually provided by `LogUnit` or `MagUnit`).
    *   We infer the calculation based on the `_function_unit` state data:
        *   `_function_unit` has a local `_scale` of `-2.0`.
        *   `_function_unit` has a `_decomposed_cache` with `_scale: 0.8`.
    *   In the `astropy.units` framework, a function unit (like magnitude) converts to the base logarithmic unit (dex/log10) using the decomposed scale factor.
    *   The relationship between the internal values suggests the unit is related to magnitudes (`mag`). A standard `mag` corresponds to a scale of `-0.4` relative to `dex` (since $m = -2.5 \log_{10}(f) \implies 1 \text{ mag} = -0.4 \text{ dex}$).
    *   The provided unit has `_scale: -2.0` (likely relative to `mag` or defined similarly) and a decomposed scale of `0.8` relative to `dex`.
        *   Checking consistency: $(-2.0) \times (-0.4 \text{ standard mag scale}) = 0.8$. This matches the `_decomposed_cache` value.
    *   Conversion logic:
        1.  Convert the input value to the base logarithmic value (`dex`, representing $\log_{10}(\text{physical})$).
        2.  `value_dex = value * decomposed_scale`.
        3.  `value_dex = 2.5 * 0.8 = 2.0`.
    *   Calculate physical value from dex:
        1.  $\text{physical} = 10^{\text{value\_dex}}$.
        2.  $\text{physical} = 10^{2.0} = 100.0$.
    *   The result is purely numerical (float) because `to` returns the value when converting to a specific unit object.

4.  **Final Output**: The function returns `100.0`.
