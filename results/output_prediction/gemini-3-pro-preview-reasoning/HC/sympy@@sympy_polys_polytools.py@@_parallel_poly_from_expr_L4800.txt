The function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` is called with `exprs=["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"]` and `opt={}`.

1.  **Parsing Expressions**: The function iterates over `exprs`.
    *   `"2"` is sympified to `Integer(2)`.
    *   `"-1*2*cos(phi)"`: sympified. `-1 * 2` becomes `-2`. `cos(phi)` becomes `cos(Symbol('phi'))`. Result: `-2*cos(phi)`.
    *   The processed `exprs` list is `[2, -2*cos(phi)]`. Both are SymPy expressions, not Polys.

2.  **Generating Representations**: `_parallel_dict_from_expr` is called.
    *   It identifies generators. `2` has none. `-2*cos(phi)` has `cos(phi)`. The unified generator list is `(cos(phi),)`.
    *   It returns a cloned options object `opt` with `gens=(cos(phi),)` set.
    *   It returns representations (`reps`) of the expressions in terms of these generators.
        *   `2` -> `{ (0,): 2 }` (0th power of generator, coeff 2)
        *   `-2*cos(phi)` -> `{ (1,): -2 }` (1st power, coeff -2)

3.  **Constructing Domain**: `construct_domain` is called on the coefficients `[2, -2]`.
    *   Both are Integers. The minimal domain is `ZZ` (Integer Ring).
    *   It returns `ZZ` and the coefficients in `ZZ`.
    *   `opt.domain` is set to `ZZ`.

4.  **Creating Polys**:
    *   For `2`: Creates `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`.
    *   For `-2*cos(phi)`: Creates `Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`.

5.  **Finalizing Options**:
    *   `opt.polys` is set. Since none of the inputs were `Poly` objects initially, `_polys` list is empty, so `opt.polys` becomes `False`.

6.  **Return Value**:
    *   Returns a tuple `(polys, opt)`.
    *   `polys`: `[Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ'), Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')]`.
    *   `opt`: A `PolyOptions` object (behaving like a dict in specific representation contexts or just containing the settings). Its state includes `gens=(cos(phi),)`, `domain=ZZ`, `polys=False`. Assuming standard properties updates, the dictionary representation (insertion order in modern Python) would be `{'gens': (cos(phi),), 'domain': ZZ, 'polys': False}`. Note `expand` is default `True` but properties usually aren't stored unless set or if `opt` is a dict snapshot. Given the input `opt` was empty `{}` and function is standalone, we treat `opt` as the resulting options container.
