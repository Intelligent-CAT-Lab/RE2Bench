The execution of `_repr_html_` involves the following steps:

1.  **Call `_repr_html_(self)`**: This function starts by calling `self._repr_png_()`.
2.  **Call `_repr_png_(self)`**:
    *   It checks `if not self._isinit:`.
    *   From the input `self` dictionary, `_isinit` is `false`.
    *   The condition is `True`.
    *   It calls `self._init()`.
3.  **Call `_init(self)`**:
    *   The `BivarColormap` class defines `_init` as:
        ```python
        def _init(self):
            raise NotImplementedError('Abstract class only')
        ```
    *   This raises a `NotImplementedError` with the message "Abstract class only".
4.  **Exception**: Since `self` is an instance of `BivarColormap` (as defined in the code block) and no subclass overriding `_init` is provided, the execution halts at this exception. Even if we hypothetically assumed `_isinit` was `True`, the `self` object in the input lacks the `_lut` attribute (it has a `patch` attribute instead), which would lead to an `AttributeError` or a crash during masking due to dimension mismatches (input `patch` is 6x6 RGB, code expects 256x256 RGBA). However, the `NotImplementedError` is encountered first.

The output is the exception raised.
