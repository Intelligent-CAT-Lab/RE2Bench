The provided Python code defines a `simplify` function that mimics the behavior of `sympy.simplify`. It takes an expression string, converts it to a SymPy object, and applies various simplification strategies, selecting the shortest result based on an operation count measure.

**Execution Simulation:**

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    The function is called with `expr = "n + n**(-n)"`.
    `sympify("n + n**(-n)")` converts this string into a symbolic expression: $n + n^{-n}$.
    Internal structure: `Add(Symbol('n'), Pow(Symbol('n'), Mul(Integer(-1), Symbol('n'))))`.

2.  **Initial Steps**:
    -   `signsimp`: The expression signs are already canonical. Result: $n + n^{-n}$.
    -   `floats`: False. `nsimplify` is skipped.
    -   `bottom_up(..., normal)`: The expression is already in a normal form for general expressions; logic primarily affects rational functions. Result: $n + n^{-n}$.

3.  **Strategy Selection (`expr1` vs `expr2`)**:
    -   The code computes `_e = cancel(expr)`.
        `cancel(n + n**(-n))` combines terms into a single fraction:
        $$ \frac{n \cdot n^n + 1}{n^n} = \frac{n^{n+1} + 1}{n^n} $$
    -   It computes `_mexpand(_e).cancel()`. `_mexpand` expands the fraction back to $n + n^{-n}$.
    -   `expr1` is the shorter/simpler of the combined fraction vs the expanded form.
        -   Measure `n + n**(-n)`: Operations are Add, Pow, Neg. Rough count: ~3.
        -   Measure `(n**(n+1) + 1)/n**n`: Operations are Div, Add (numerator), Pow (numerator), Add (exponent), Pow (denominator). Rough count: ~5 or 6.
        -   The expanded form $n + n^{-n}$ is chosen as `expr1`.
    -   `expr2` considers `together(expr)`. `together` also produces the combined fraction $\frac{n^{n+1} + 1}{n^n}$.
    -   Comparisons using `shorter` will prefer the original expanded form because it has fewer operations.

4.  **Further Simplifications**:
    -   `factor_terms`: No common terms to factor between $n$ and $n^{-n}$.
    -   `hyperexpand`, `besselsimp`, `trigsimp`, `logcombine`, `combsimp`, `sum_simplify`, `product_simplify`: None of these apply to the simple expression $n + n^{-n}$.
    -   `powsimp`: No powers with same base to combine (bases are $n$, exponents $1$ and $-n$).

5.  **Final Checks**:
    -   The code checks for rationalizing denominators (`radsimp`) or extracting minus signs. Neither applies efficiently or changes the form for the better here.
    -   The operation count of the result is not significantly worse than the original (it is the original), so it is kept.

**Conclusion**:
The function finds that the input expression $n + n^{-n}$ is already in its simplest form according to the `count_ops` metric compared to alternatives like $\frac{n^{n+1} + 1}{n^n}$.
