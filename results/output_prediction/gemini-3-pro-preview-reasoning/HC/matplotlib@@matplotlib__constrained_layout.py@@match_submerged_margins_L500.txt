[THOUGHT]
The function `match_submerged_margins(layoutgrids, fig)` is called.

1.  **Initialize**: The function starts by iterating over `fig.subfigs` to process subfigures recursively.
    *   The input `fig` is described as `"<Figure size 1000x500 with 2 Axes>"`. This description implies a standard Figure with 2 Axes and no notable subfigures. Thus, `fig.subfigs` is effectively empty, and `axsdone` remains `[]`.

2.  **Get Axes**: The function retrieves axes using `fig.get_axes()`.
    *   Based on the input description "with 2 Axes", this list contains two `Axes` objects (let's denote them as `ax1` and `ax2`).

3.  **Filter Axes**: The code creates the `axs` list by filtering for axes that have a `subplotspec`, are `in_layout`, and are not in `axsdone`.
    *   Standard axes created in a grid (implied by `GridSpec(1, 2)`) satisfy these conditions.
    *   `axs = [ax1, ax2]`.

4.  **Loop over `axs`**: The function iterates through each axis to check for constrained layout requirements.

    *   **Processing `ax1`**:
        *   `ss1 = ax1.get_subplotspec()`.
        *   `lg1 = layoutgrids[ss1.get_gridspec()]`. The input `layoutgrids` contains the key `"GridSpec(1, 2)"`. We assume the axes belong to this GridSpec, so the check `not in layoutgrids` is False.
        *   **Check Column Span**: `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1`.
            *   The GridSpec is `1x2`. With 2 axes, `ax1` typically occupies position `(0, 0)`.
            *   Its `colspan` is `range(0, 1)`, which has length 1.
            *   The condition is False. The body (calculating `maxsubl`, etc.) is skipped.
        *   **Check Row Span**: `if len(ss1.rowspan) > 1`.
            *   Its `rowspan` is `range(0, 1)`, which has length 1.
            *   The condition is False.
    
    *   **Processing `ax2`**:
        *   Similar logic applies. `ax2` typically occupies position `(0, 1)`.
        *   `colspan` length is 1 (`range(1, 2)`).
        *   `rowspan` length is 1.
        *   Both conditions `len > 1` are False.

5.  **Return**: The function returns `axs`.
    *   The list remains `[ax1, ax2]`.
    *   Since the input JSON does not provide the exact string representations/identities of the axes objects, and sticking to standard Matplotlib representations for subplots, we represent them as a list of `AxesSubplot` object strings.
