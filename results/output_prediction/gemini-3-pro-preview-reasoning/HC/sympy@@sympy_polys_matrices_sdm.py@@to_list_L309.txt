The function `to_list(M)` converts a sparse matrix representation (as a dictionary of dictionaries) into a dense standard Python list of lists (matrix).

1.  **Analyze Input**: The function input `M` is provided as a dictionary behaving like a Sparse Dictionary Matrix (`SDM`). The content is:
    *   Row 0: Contains elements at Column 0 and Column 1.
    *   Row 1: Contains elements at Column 0 and Column 1.

2.  **Determine Shape**: The code normally retrieves `m, n = M.shape`. The input JSON does not explicitly list attributes like `shape` or `domain` for `M`. However, we can infer the shape from the indices present in the data. The maximum row index is 1, and the maximum column index is 1. Assuming the tightest fit (which is standard when data is provided this way and `zero` value is unknown), the dimensions are `m=2` rows and `n=2` columns.

3.  **Initialize Result**: The code initializes `ddm` as a 2x2 list of lists filled with `M.domain.zero`.
    `ddm = [[zero, zero], [zero, zero]]`

4.  **Populate Matrix**: The function then iterates through the items in `M`:
    *   **Row `i=0`**:
        *   Inner dictionary `row` has keys `0` and `1` (which correspond to columns `j`).
        *   At `j=0`, `e` is `"Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])"`. We set `ddm[0][0] = e`.
        *   At `j=1`, `e` is `"Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"`. We set `ddm[0][1] = e`.
    *   **Row `i=1`**:
        *   Inner dictionary `row` has keys `0` and `1`.
        *   At `j=0`, `e` is `"Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])"`. We set `ddm[1][0] = e`.
        *   At `j=1`, `e` is `"Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"`. We set `ddm[1][1] = e`.

5.  **Handling "zero"**: Since every cell in the 2x2 grid (indices (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) is populated by the input dictionary, the initial `zero` values are completely overwritten. Thus, we do not need to know the specific value of `M.domain.zero`.

6.  **Format Output**: The resulting `ddm` is return. It is a list of lists containing the string values provided in the input.

Final Matrix:
Row 0: `["Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])", "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"]`
Row 1: `["Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])", "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"]`
