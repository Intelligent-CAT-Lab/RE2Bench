The `StratifiedKFold` class with `shuffle=False` distributes samples from each class into folds in a deterministic manner. Since `n_splits=5` and the Iris dataset has 50 samples per class, each fold will contain 10 samples from each of the 3 classes.
The method `_make_test_folds` assigns a fold ID (0 to 4) to each sample. With `shuffle=False`, it assigns the first 10 samples (as they appear in `y`) of a class to fold 0, the next 10 to fold 1, and so on.

The `y` values (parsed from input):
- Class 0 (encoded 0): 50 samples
- Class 1 (encoded 2): 50 samples
- Class 2 (encoded 1): 50 samples

Based on the counts of each class encountered sequentially in `y`, the fold assignments are:
