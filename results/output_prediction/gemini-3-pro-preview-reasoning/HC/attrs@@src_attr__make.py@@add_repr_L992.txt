The function `add_repr` is a method of the `_ClassBuilder` class. Let's trace its execution based on the provided inputs.

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    *   `self`: A `_ClassBuilder` instance represented by the string `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`.
    *   `ns` (argument): `None` (from input `null`).

2.  **Execution of `add_repr`**:
    *   Line `script, globs = _make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns)`: The method calls the helper function `_make_repr_script`. Since `ns` is `None`, this helper generates the source code (script) and globals for a `__repr__` method that infers the class name dynamically. We assume `self._attrs` exists and is valid, as `self` represents a valid builder instance.
    *   Line `def _attach_repr(cls_dict, globs): ...`: A closure is defined to attach the generated `__repr__` dictionary to the class later.
    *   Line `self._script_snippets.append((script, globs, _attach_repr))`: The script, globals, and attacher are saved to the builder's state.
    *   Line `self._repr_added = True`: A flag is set indicating `__repr__` has been handled.
    *   Line `return self`: The method returns the `self` instance.

3.  **Output Determination**:
    *   The function returns the `self` object.
    *   The input representation for this object is `"<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"`.
    *   Since the return value is the object itself, the output matches the input representation.
