[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with a=10, b=6, c=8.

1. Compute squares:
   - a * a = 10 * 10 = 100
   - b * b = 6 * 6 = 36
   - c * c = 8 * 8 = 64

2. Evaluate the three conditions in the return expression:
   - Check if a*a == b*b + c*c: 100 == 36 + 64 -> 100 == 100 -> True
   - (No need to check further because the first condition is already True, but for completeness:)
   - Check if b*b == a*a + c*c: 36 == 100 + 64 -> 36 == 164 -> False
   - Check if c*c == a*a + b*b: 64 == 100 + 36 -> 64 == 136 -> False

Since the first condition is True, the function returns True.
