[THOUGHT]
We need to run f(text, ch) which returns text.count(ch).

Given text: "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!" and ch: " " (space).
Count how many space characters are in the string.

Break the string into tokens separated by spaces:
- "This" (then space) -> 1
- "be" (then space) -> 2
- "Pirate's" (then space) -> 3
- "Speak" (then space) -> 4
- "for" (then space) -> 5
- "'help'!" (no trailing space)

So text.count(" ") == 5.
