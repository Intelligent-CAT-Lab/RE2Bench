[THOUGHT]
We call re.split(r"\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b", text).

Text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

Matches of the pattern are the three phone numbers:
- "123-456-7890" at the start
- "876-286-9876" after " abiguygusu "
- "987-762-9767" after " kjgufwycs "

re.split returns the substrings between matches (no capturing groups are present), so:
- Before the first match: "" (empty string, since the first match is at the start)
- Between first and second match: " abiguygusu " (including surrounding spaces)
- Between second and third match: " kjgufwycs " (including surrounding spaces)
- After the third match: "" (empty string, since the last match ends the string)

Thus the result list is: ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]
}
```
