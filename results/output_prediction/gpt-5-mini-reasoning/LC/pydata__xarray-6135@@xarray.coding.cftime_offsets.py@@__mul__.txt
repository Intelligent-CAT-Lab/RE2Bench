[THOUGHT]
1. The method __mul__ checks if other is a float; other is -1 (an int), so this check is False.
2. It returns type(self)(n=other * self.n, month=self.month).
3. self.n is 1, other is -1, so n = -1 * 1 = -1. month remains 2.
4. The resulting object's attributes are n = -1 and month = 2.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "n": -1,
    "month": 2
}
```
