[THOUGHT]
We call remove_item on the ShoppingCart instance whose items contains "apple" with quantity 4.
- The method checks if "apple" in self.items: True.
- It subtracts quantity (default 1) from self.items["apple"]["quantity"]: 4 - 1 = 3.
- The method has no return statement, so it returns None (which is null in JSON).

The cart's items would be updated to {"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 3}}, but the function return value is None.
