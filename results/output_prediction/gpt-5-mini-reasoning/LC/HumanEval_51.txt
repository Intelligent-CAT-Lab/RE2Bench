[THOUGHT]
We run remove_vowels on the string "abcdef\nghijklm".

Step through each character:
- 'a' -> vowel, removed
- 'b' -> kept
- 'c' -> kept
- 'd' -> kept
- 'e' -> vowel, removed
- 'f' -> kept
- '\n' -> newline, not a vowel, kept
- 'g' -> kept
- 'h' -> kept
- 'i' -> vowel, removed
- 'j' -> kept
- 'k' -> kept
- 'l' -> kept
- 'm' -> kept

Concatenating the kept characters yields: "bcdf\nghjklm"

[OUTPUT]

{
    "output": "bcdf\nghjklm"        
}
