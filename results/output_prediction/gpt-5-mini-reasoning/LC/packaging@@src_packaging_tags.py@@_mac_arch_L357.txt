[THOUGHT]
The function checks is_32bit first. The input sets is_32bit = True, so "if not is_32bit" is False and we continue.
Next it checks whether arch starts with "ppc". The input arch is "x86_64", which does not start with "ppc".
Since both prior checks failed, the function returns "i386".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "i386"        
}
