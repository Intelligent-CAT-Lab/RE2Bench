[THOUGHT]
We call JobMarketplace.withdraw_resume with self.resumes = [] and resume = {"name": "Tom", ...}.

The method body executes self.resumes.remove(resume).

Python list.remove(x) will search for an element equal to resume. Since the list is empty, no element is found, so remove raises a ValueError with message "list.remove(x): x not in list".

Therefore the call will raise a ValueError exception; no return value is produced.
