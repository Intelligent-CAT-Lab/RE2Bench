[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives array = [] (an empty list).
2. just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array)) maps over an empty list, so just_ns becomes [].
3. final_output is initialized to [].
4. The for loop "for wipe in just_ns" has no iterations because just_ns is empty, so nothing is appended.
5. The function returns final_output, which is [].
