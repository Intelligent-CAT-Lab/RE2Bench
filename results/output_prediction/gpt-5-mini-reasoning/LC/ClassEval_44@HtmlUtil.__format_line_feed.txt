[THOUGHT]
The method compiles the regex '\\n+' (one or more newline characters) and replaces matches with a single '\n'.
Input text is "Some sentence here." which contains no newline characters, so no substitution occurs.
The returned value is the original string: "Some sentence here.".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
```
