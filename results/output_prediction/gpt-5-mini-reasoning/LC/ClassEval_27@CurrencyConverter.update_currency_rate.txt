[THOUGHT]
We simulate update_currency_rate:

1. The method receives self with rates containing "CNY": 7.18 (and other currencies).
2. It checks "if currency not in self.rates": currency is "CNY", which is present, so this condition is False and it does not return False.
3. It executes self.rates[currency] = new_rate, setting self.rates["CNY"] = 7.18 (same value).
4. There is no explicit return after that assignment, so the function returns None (Python's default return value).

Therefore the output is None, which corresponds to null in JSON.
