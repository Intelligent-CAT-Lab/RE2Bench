[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads a single line from input: "1 1 1" (the JSON-escaped string indicates the line contains 1 1 1).
2. Splitting that line gives the tokens ['1', '1', '1'].
3. map(int, ...) converts them to integers: A = 1, B = 1, T = 1.
4. Compute ans = T // A * B = 1 // 1 * 1 = 1.
5. The program prints 1.
