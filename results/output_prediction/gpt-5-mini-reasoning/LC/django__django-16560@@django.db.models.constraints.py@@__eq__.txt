[THOUGHT]
1. The method first checks if isinstance(other, CheckConstraint). The provided "other" has the same structure/attributes as "self" (both have name, check, violation_error_code, violation_error_message), so we treat it as an instance of CheckConstraint for this equality comparison.
2. Because isinstance is True, the method returns the conjunction of four comparisons:
   - self.name == other.name -> "price" == "price" => True
   - self.check == other.check -> the two check dicts have the same keys and values (children:null, connector:"AND", negated:false) => True
   - self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code -> "custom_code" == "custom_code" => True
   - self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message -> both dicts have identical _proxy____args and _proxy____kw => True
3. All four comparisons are True, so the final returned value is True.
