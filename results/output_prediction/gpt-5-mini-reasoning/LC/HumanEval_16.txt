[THOUGHT]
Let's run the function step by step.

1. Input string is "Jerry jERRY JeRRRY".
2. The function lowercases the entire string: "jerry jerry jerrry".
3. It then builds a set of all characters in that lowercased string. The characters present are:
   - 'j'
   - 'e'
   - 'r'
   - 'y'
   - ' ' (space)
4. The size of this set is 5.

So the function returns 5.
