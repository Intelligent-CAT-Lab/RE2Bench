[THOUGHT]
- gf_rem calls gf_div(f, g, p, K) and returns the remainder (index 1 of the tuple).
- Determine degrees: f = [2, 0] is of degree 1 (length 2 -> degree 1). g = [1, 0, 1] is of degree 2 (length 3 -> degree 2).
- In gf_div, since df < dg (1 < 2), the function immediately returns ([], f) where f is returned unchanged as the remainder.
- Therefore gf_rem returns f which is [2, 0].
