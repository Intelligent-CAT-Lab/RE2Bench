[THOUGHT]
We call Permutation.__invert__ on an instance with _array_form = None and _size = 5.

The method body is:
    return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))

Evaluation order:
- Python first evaluates the argument expression _af_invert(self._array_form). The name _af_invert is looked up in globals; there is no definition of _af_invert in the provided code, so this lookup raises a NameError before anything else is executed.
- Because a NameError is raised, the method does not return a new permutation and does not modify the instance.

Thus the call fails with NameError; no new object is produced and the instance state remains as given (_array_form is None, _size is 5). Representing the instance state as the output structure yields the same values.
