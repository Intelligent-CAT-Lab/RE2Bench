[THOUGHT]
The function does a, b = interval. The provided interval is the string "array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])", which is an iterable of many characters, not a 2-element sequence. Python will attempt to unpack the string into exactly two values but finds more than two characters, so unpacking raises a ValueError: "too many values to unpack (expected 2)". The function therefore does not return True/False but raises that exception.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)"
}
