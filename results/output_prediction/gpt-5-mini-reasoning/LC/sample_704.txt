[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step with s=".", n=0, c="99".

1. Compute width = len(c) * n. len("99") = 2, so width = 2 * 0 = 0.
2. len(s) = len(".") = 1.
3. The loop is for _ in range(width - len(s)) => range(0 - 1) => range(-1). A range with a negative value is empty, so the loop body does not execute at all.
4. Since the loop never runs, s remains unchanged as ".".
5. The function returns ".".
