[THOUGHT]
1. The method as_content_primitive simply returns the tuple (S.One, self), ignoring the values of the radical and clear arguments.
2. Given the provided self object {"nargs": "{1}"}, the returned tuple's first element is S.One and the second element is that same self object.
3. Represent the returned tuple as a JSON array with two elements: the symbol "S.One" (to denote the singleton) and the original self dictionary.
