[THOUGHT]
1. input() reads the line. The provided input corresponds to: 7 5 5
2. input().split() -> ["7", "5", "5"]
3. map(int, ...) converts to integers and tuple(...) gives ABC = (7, 5, 5)
4. ABC.count(5) == 2 → True (there are two 5's)
5. sum(ABC) == 17 → 7 + 5 + 5 = 17 → True
6. Since both conditions hold, the code prints "YES"

[OUTPUT]

{
    "output": "YES"
}
