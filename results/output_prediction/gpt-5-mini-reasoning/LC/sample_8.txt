[THOUGHT]
We call f("UppEr", 0).

1. The function checks if encryption == 0. Here encryption is 0, so the condition is True.
2. Because the condition is True, the function returns the original string argument unchanged.
3. The else branch (which would call string.upper().encode('rot13')) is not executed.

Therefore the returned value is the input string "UppEr".
