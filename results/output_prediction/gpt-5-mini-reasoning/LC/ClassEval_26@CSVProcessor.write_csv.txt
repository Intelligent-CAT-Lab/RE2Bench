[THOUGHT]
The method write_csv tries to open the given file name for writing and use csv.writer to write the provided rows.

1. It will call open('read_test_process.csv', 'w', newline='') — assume this succeeds in the environment.
2. csv.writer(file) creates a CSV writer.
3. writer.writerows(data) will write the two rows:
   - ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
   - ["ME"]
   No errors occur.
4. The function returns 1 on successful completion (inside try).
Therefore the output will be the integer 1.
