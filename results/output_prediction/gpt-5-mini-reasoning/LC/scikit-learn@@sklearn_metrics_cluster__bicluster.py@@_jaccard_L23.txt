We compute step by step.

Arrays lengths are 30 each.

a_rows and b_rows are identical. True positions in a_rows: indices [1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 14, 27] → a_rows.sum() = 7.
Since b_rows is identical, b_rows.sum() = 7 and (a_rows & b_rows).sum() = 7.

a_cols and b_cols are identical. True positions in a_cols: indices [4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 22, 25, 29] → a_cols.sum() = 8.
Since b_cols is identical, b_cols.sum() = 8 and (a_cols & b_cols).sum() = 8.

intersection = (a_rows & b_rows).sum() * (a_cols & b_cols).sum() = 7 * 8 = 56.
a_size = a_rows.sum() * a_cols.sum() = 7 * 8 = 56.
b_size = 7 * 8 = 56.

_jaccard = intersection / (a_size + b_size - intersection) = 56 / (56 + 56 - 56) = 56 / 56 = 1.0
