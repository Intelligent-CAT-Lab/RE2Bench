[THOUGHT]
We call precision_score(y_true=None, y_pred=None). precision_score calls precision_recall_fscore_support with the same y_true and y_pred.

Inside precision_recall_fscore_support, it calls _check_targets(y_true, y_pred).

_check_targets first calls check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred). Since both are None, check_consistent_length computes lengths = [] and returns without error.

_next, _check_targets calls type_of_target(y_true) with y_true = None.

type_of_target checks whether the input is array-like: for None this check fails (neither a Sequence nor has __array__). Therefore type_of_target raises a ValueError with message:
"Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None"

This exception propagates back up; precision_recall_fscore_support and precision_score do not catch it, so the call to precision_score raises the same ValueError.
