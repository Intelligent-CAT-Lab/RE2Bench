[THOUGHT]
We have a Thermostat instance with current_temperature = 25, target_temperature = 25, mode = "cool".
auto_set_mode checks if current_temperature < target_temperature:
- 25 < 25 is False.
So the else branch runs, setting self.mode = 'cool'. The mode remains "cool".
The method does not return any value, so its return value is None (JSON null).
