[THOUGHT]
1. The method checks `isinstance(node.op, ast.Not)`. The provided `node.op` is represented as `{}` (which corresponds to an operator like ast.Invert in real AST), so this check is False.
2. Therefore the code executes the second branch: `return '%s%s' % (self.visit(node.op), self.visit(node.operand))`.
3. `self.visit(node.op)` is called. `node.op` is an AST operator node with no fields (e.g. ast.Invert). There is no `visit_Invert` defined on the visitor, so the NodeVisitor falls back to `generic_visit`, which returns None.
4. `self.visit(node.operand)` is called. The operand is an AST number node (value 1). There is no `visit_Num`/`visit_Constant` implemented, so again `generic_visit` is used and returns None.
5. The formatted string substitutes both results with their string representations: '%s%s' % (None, None) -> 'NoneNone'.
6. Thus the method returns the string "NoneNone".
