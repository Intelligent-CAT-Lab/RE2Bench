[THOUGHT]
1. The function reads n1 = x.__name__ and n2 = y.__name__. For the given classes:
   - n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"
   - n2 = "Pi"

2. It checks if n1 == n2 — they are different, so continue.

3. It checks if not issubclass(y, Basic). Both Pi and ImaginaryUnit in SymPy are expression/number classes that inherit from Basic, so issubclass(y, Basic) is True and we do not return -1 here.

4. UNKNOWN is set to len(ordering_of_classes) + 1. The code then tries to find the index of each name in ordering_of_classes. It's unlikely both "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" are present in ordering_of_classes; assuming they are not found, both i1 and i2 become UNKNOWN.

5. If both indices are UNKNOWN, the function falls back to lexicographic comparison:
   return (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2).

   Compare "ImaginaryUnit" vs "Pi": "ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi" lexicographically, so (n1 > n2) is False (0) and (n1 < n2) is True (1). The result is 0 - 1 = -1.

6. Therefore the function returns -1.
