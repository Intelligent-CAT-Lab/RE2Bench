[THOUGHT]
We call delete_from_database with self.database_name = "test.db", table_name = "test_table", name = "Alice".

Step-by-step:
1. sqlite3.connect("test.db") is called to open a connection to the SQLite database file "test.db".
2. A cursor is created from that connection.
3. delete_query is built as the string: 'DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?'
4. cursor.execute(delete_query, ("Alice",)) is executed, which will delete rows from test_table where the name column equals "Alice".
   - This is a parameterized query, so "Alice" is bound to the placeholder.
5. conn.commit() is called to commit the transaction.
6. conn.close() is called to close the connection.
7. The function has no return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the output value is None (null in JSON).
