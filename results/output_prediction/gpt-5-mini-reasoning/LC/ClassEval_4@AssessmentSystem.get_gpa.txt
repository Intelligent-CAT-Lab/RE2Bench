[THOUGHT]
We call get_gpa with name "Charlie".
1. Check if "Charlie" in self.students: yes.
2. Check if self.students["Charlie"]['courses'] is non-empty: courses = {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}, so yes.
3. Calculate sum of course grades: 70 + 80 = 150.
4. Count courses: 2.
5. Compute GPA as 150 / 2 = 75.0 (float).
6. The method returns 75.0.
