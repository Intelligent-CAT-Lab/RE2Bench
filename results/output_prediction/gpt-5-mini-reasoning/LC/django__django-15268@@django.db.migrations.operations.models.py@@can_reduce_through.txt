[THOUGHT]
We evaluate AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label).

The method returns:
  super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label)
  OR
  (isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation) and type(operation) is not type(self))

We don't need the exact result of the super() call, because the second part is True:
- Both objects represent "together" option alterations (one has unique_together, the other index_together), so they are instances of the common AlterTogetherOptionOperation base class => isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation) is True.
- Their concrete types differ (one is for unique_together, the other for index_together), so type(operation) is not type(self) is True.

Thus the OR expression is True and the method returns True.
