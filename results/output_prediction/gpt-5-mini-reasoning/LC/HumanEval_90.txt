[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function receives lst = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2].
2. It creates a set from lst to remove duplicates: set(lst) -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
3. It sorts that set: sorted(set(lst)) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. So lst becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
4. It checks if len(lst) < 2. Here len(lst) == 5, so the condition is False.
5. It returns lst[1], which is 2.

The function's output is 2.
