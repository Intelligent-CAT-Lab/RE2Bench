[THOUGHT]
1. The Integer.__lt__ method first tries to convert other via _sympify(other).
2. _sympify calls sympify(a, strict=True) which does not accept plain Python strings; passing "1" raises SympifyError.
3. The SympifyError is caught by the except block, and the method returns NotImplemented.
4. The value of self ("3") is irrelevant because execution returns early due to the SympifyError.
