[THOUGHT]
The program reads a line of input, splits it into tokens, converts them to integers, then prints the minimum followed by either half the absolute difference (floored) if the difference >= 2, otherwise 0.

Interpreting the provided input "\"1 1\"" as the line:
1 1

Step-by-step:
- input() -> "1 1"
- split() -> ["1", "1"]
- convert to int -> x = [1, 1]
- a = 1, b = 1
- print(min(x), end=' ') -> prints "1 "
- abs(a - b) = 0, which is not >= 2, so print(0)

Final printed line: "1 0"
