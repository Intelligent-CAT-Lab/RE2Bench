[THOUGHT]
1. Call is_bored with S = "bIt".
2. re.split('[.?!]\\s*', S) splits S on occurrences of '.', '?', or '!' followed by optional whitespace. There are no such punctuation characters in "bIt", so sentences = ["bIt"].
3. For each sentence in sentences, the code checks sentence[0:2] == 'I '. For the single sentence "bIt", sentence[0:2] is "bI".
4. "bI" == "I " is False, which as an integer is 0.
5. sum of the generator over the list yields 0.
6. The function returns 0.
