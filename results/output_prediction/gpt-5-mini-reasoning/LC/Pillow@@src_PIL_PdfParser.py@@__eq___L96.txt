[THOUGHT]
We evaluate IndirectReference.__eq__(self, other) with:
- self = {} (a dict)
- other = [1, 2] (a list)

The method returns:
  other.__class__ is self.__class__ and other.object_id == self.object_id and (other.generation == self.generation)

Evaluation in Python is left-to-right with short-circuiting:
1. other.__class__ is self.__class__:
   - other.__class__ is <class 'list'>
   - self.__class__ is <class 'dict'>
   - Identity comparison is False.
2. Because the first operand is False, the 'and' expression short-circuits and the method returns False immediately.
   - No attribute access (other.object_id, etc.) occurs, so no AttributeError is raised.

Therefore the result is False.
