[THOUGHT]
1. input() reads the string "99".
2. N = int("99") -> N = 99.
3. Check N % 2 == 0 -> 99 % 2 == 1, so it's False (N is odd).
4. Execute else branch: compute (N + 1) / N / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2 = 50 / 99.
5. 50/99 as a Python float prints as 0.5050505050505051.

Therefore the program will print: 0.5050505050505051
