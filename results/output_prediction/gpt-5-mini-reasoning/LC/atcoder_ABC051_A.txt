[THOUGHT]
The program reads one line via input(). The provided input value is the JSON string "\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\"" — that means the actual characters read include the surrounding double-quote characters.

So the string read is:
"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
(with literal double quotes as the first and last characters).

The code calls .replace(',', ' '), which replaces each comma with a space. Applying that yields:
"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"
(the double quotes remain).

print(...) outputs that exact line including the double quotes.
