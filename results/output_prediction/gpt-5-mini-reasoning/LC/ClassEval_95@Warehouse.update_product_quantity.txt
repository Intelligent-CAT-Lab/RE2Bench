[THOUGHT]
We call update_product_quantity with self.inventory having a key "1" (string) and product_id passed as the integer 1.

Inside the method:
- It checks `if product_id in self.inventory:` which tests whether the integer 1 is a key in the dict. The existing key is the string "1", so the test is False.
- Because the condition is False, the body is not executed; no quantity is changed.
- The function has no return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the method returns None (JSON null).
