[THOUGHT]
We call ArgumentParser.add_argument(self, arg="age", required=False, arg_type="<class 'int'>").

Step-by-step:
- The method checks "if required:". Here required is False, so the body (self.required.add(arg)) is not executed. No modification to self.required occurs. (Note: self.required is provided as the string "set()", but that doesn't matter because the branch is skipped.)
- The method then executes self.types[arg] = arg_type. That sets/update the "age" key in self.types to the provided arg_type "<class 'int'>". (It was already "<class 'int'>" in the provided self.types, so this just leaves it equivalent.)
- The method does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the output (return value) is None (null in JSON).
