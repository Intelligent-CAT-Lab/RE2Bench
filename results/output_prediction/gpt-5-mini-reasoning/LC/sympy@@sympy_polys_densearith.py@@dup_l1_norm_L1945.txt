[THOUGHT]
1. dup_l1_norm checks if f is empty. Here f = [1, 2], so it's not empty.
2. It calls dup_abs(f, K), which returns a list of absolute values of coefficients: [abs(1), abs(2)] -> [1, 2].
3. It then calls K.sum on that list. The domain sum adds the list starting from K.zero: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.
4. Therefore dup_l1_norm returns 3.
