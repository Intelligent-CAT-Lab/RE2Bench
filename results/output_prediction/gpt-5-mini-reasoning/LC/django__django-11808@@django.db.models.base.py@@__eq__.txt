[THOUGHT]
1. __eq__ first checks `isinstance(other, Model)`. The provided `other` is represented as the same model instance type, so treat this as True.
2. Next it compares `self._meta.concrete_model` and `other._meta.concrete_model`. The inputs represent the same model class, so treat them as equal → condition passes.
3. It then obtains `my_pk = self.pk`. The pk property uses _get_pk_val which returns the attribute named by meta.pk.attname; in typical Django models this is "id", and `self["id"]` is 1 → my_pk = 1.
4. Since my_pk is not None, it returns `my_pk == other.pk`. other.pk is also 1 → 1 == 1 is True.
5. Therefore __eq__ returns True.
