[THOUGHT]
We call add_book with self.inventory = {"book1": 2, "book2": 1} and title="book2" (quantity uses default 1).

1. The method checks if "book2" is in self.inventory — it is.
2. It increments self.inventory["book2"] by quantity (1), so "book2" becomes 2.
3. The method has no return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the output (the function return value) is None.
