[THOUGHT]
We call _polynomial_integrate with:
- polynomials = {"2": "x*y"} (a dict whose single key is the string "2")
- facets = None
- hp_params = None

Inspecting the function:
- It sets dims = (x, y) and dim_length = 2, and integral_value = S.Zero.
- It then iterates: for deg in polynomials: — this will iterate over the dict keys (so deg will be the string "2").
- Inside that loop it sets poly_contribute = S.Zero and facet_count = 0.
- Next it does: for hp in hp_params: ...
  But hp_params is None, so attempting "for hp in hp_params" raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable" before any further computation occurs.

Therefore the function will not return a numeric result but will raise a TypeError with message "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
