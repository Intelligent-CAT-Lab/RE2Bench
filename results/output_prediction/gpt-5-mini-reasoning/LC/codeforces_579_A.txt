[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads the input and sets n = int("536870912") = 536870912.
2. x is initialized to 1.
3. Compute math.log2(n). Since 536870912 = 2^29, math.log2(n) = 29.0.
4. The while condition is math.log2(n) % 1, which is 29.0 % 1 = 0.0 — this is falsy, so the loop body does not execute.
5. x remains 1, and print(x) outputs 1.
