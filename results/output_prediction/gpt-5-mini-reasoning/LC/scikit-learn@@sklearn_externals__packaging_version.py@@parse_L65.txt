[THOUGHT]
1. parse is called with version = "1.11.3".
2. The function tries to construct Version("1.11.3").
3. Version.__init__ runs the regex match against "1.11.3" — this is a valid PEP 440 version, so the match succeeds.
4. Version.__init__ builds the internal _version with epoch=0 and release=(1, 11, 3), and other components (pre, post, dev, local) as None, then computes the sorting key.
5. No InvalidVersion is raised, so parse returns the Version instance representing "1.11.3".
6. Representing the returned Version in the output as its canonical string form yields "1.11.3".
