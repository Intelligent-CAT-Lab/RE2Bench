[THOUGHT]
The function f(title) returns title.lower() without trimming or altering whitespace.

Input title is "   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ".
Applying .lower() converts letters to lowercase but preserves all spaces:
- Leading three spaces remain.
- "Rock" -> "rock"
- Middle multiple spaces remain between words.
- "SCISSORS" -> "scissors"
- Two trailing spaces remain.

So the result is "   rock   paper   scissors  ".
