[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers from input.

Given input string (without the surrounding JSON quoting): 3 4 7 8
So anti = 3, b = 4, c = 7, d = 8.

Compute l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4
Compute m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4

Check conditions in order:
- anti == c? 3 == 7 → False
- b == d? 4 == 8 → False
- l != m? 4 != 4 → False

None of the above, so execute the else branch: print(anti, d, c, b)
That prints: 3 8 7 4
