[THOUGHT]
We call f with array = [6, 2, 7, 1] and elem = 6.

1. The function checks "if elem in array": 6 is present in the list, so this is True.
2. It then returns array.index(elem). array.index(6) is 0 because 6 is the first element of the list (zero-based index).
3. Therefore the function returns 0.
