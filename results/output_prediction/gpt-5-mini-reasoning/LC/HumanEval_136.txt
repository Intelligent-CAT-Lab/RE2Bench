[THOUGHT]
1. The function filters lst into two lists:
   - smallest = elements < 0
   - largest = elements > 0
2. Given lst = [-1, -3, -5, -6, 0]:
   - smallest = [-1, -3, -5, -6]
   - largest = [] (0 is not > 0)
3. The function returns (max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None).
   - max(smallest) = -1
   - largest is empty, so the second value is None
4. Final returned value is the tuple (-1, None), which in JSON is represented as [-1, null].
