[THOUGHT]
The program reads one character from input, gets its Unicode code point with ord(), adds 1, converts back to a character with chr(), and prints it.

The provided JSON input "\"a\"" represents the character a as the input. So:
- input() -> 'a'
- ord('a') = 97
- 97 + 1 = 98
- chr(98) = 'b'
The program will print: b
