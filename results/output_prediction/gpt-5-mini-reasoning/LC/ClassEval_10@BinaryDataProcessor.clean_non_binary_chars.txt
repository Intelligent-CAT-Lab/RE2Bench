[THOUGHT]
We call clean_non_binary_chars on self.binary_string = "01101000011011010110001001101111".

- The method constructs a new string by joining characters x from the original string if x is in '01'.
- The original string contains only '0' and '1', so every character passes the filter.
- The attribute self.binary_string is set to the same string "01101000011011010110001001101111".
- The method has no return statement, so it returns None (which corresponds to null in JSON).

Therefore the output (the method's return value) is null, and the object's binary_string would remain "01101000011011010110001001101111".
