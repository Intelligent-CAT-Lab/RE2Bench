[THOUGHT]
1. The function f receives nums = [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
2. count = len(nums) = 5.
3. The for-loop iterates for num in range(2, count), i.e., num = 2, 3, 4 (three iterations).
4. On each iteration the code calls nums.sort(), which sorts the list in place. The input list is already in ascending order, so repeated sorts do not change it.
5. After the loop, the function returns nums, which remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
