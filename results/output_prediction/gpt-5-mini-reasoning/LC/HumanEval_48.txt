[THOUGHT]
We run is_palindrome on text = "xywzx".

1. Compute length: len(text) = 5. The loop will run i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
2. i = 0: compare text[0] ('x') to text[5-1-0] = text[4] ('x'). They are equal, so continue.
3. i = 1: compare text[1] ('y') to text[5-1-1] = text[3] ('z'). They are not equal, so the function returns False immediately.

No further iterations occur. The final returned value is False.
