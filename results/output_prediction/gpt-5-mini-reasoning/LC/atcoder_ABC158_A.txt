[THOUGHT]
The program reads the entire stdin into s. The provided input value is "\"BBA\"" which is a string containing the double-quote characters and the letters B, B, A (i.e. s == "\"BBA\"").

Check condition: 'A' in s is True (there is an 'A'), and 'B' in s is True (there are 'B's). Both are True, so result is 'Yes'. The program prints Yes.
