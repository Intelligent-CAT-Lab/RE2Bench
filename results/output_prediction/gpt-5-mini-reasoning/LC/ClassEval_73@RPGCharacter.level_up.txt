[THOUGHT]
We start with an RPGCharacter instance having:
- name: "John"
- hp: 140
- attack_power: 30
- defense: 20
- level: 3
- exp: 0

Call level_up():
1. Check if level < 100: 3 < 100 is True.
2. Increment level: level becomes 4.
3. Reset exp to 0 (already 0).
4. Increase hp by 20: 140 + 20 = 160.
5. Increase attack_power by 5: 30 + 5 = 35.
6. Increase defense by 5: 20 + 5 = 25.
7. Return tuple (level, hp, attack_power, defense) -> (4, 160, 35, 25).

So the output is the tuple with these updated values.
