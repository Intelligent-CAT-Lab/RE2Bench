[THOUGHT]
We call recall_score(y_true=None, y_pred=None, labels=None, average=None). recall_score forwards these to precision_recall_fscore_support with pos_label=1 and warn_for=('recall',).

precision_recall_fscore_support calls _check_targets(y_true, y_pred).

In _check_targets the first operation is check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred). That function builds lengths = [_num_samples(X) for X in arrays if X is not None]. Since both y_true and y_pred are None, lengths is an empty list and check_consistent_length returns without error.

_next, _check_targets calls type_of_target(y_true) with y_true = None.

In type_of_target, the code checks whether the input is array-like:
  valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str))
For y = None this is False, so type_of_target raises:
  ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y)
with y represented as None.

This ValueError propagates up and is the result of calling recall_score in this case.
