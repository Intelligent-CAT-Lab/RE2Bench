[THOUGHT]
We are evaluating PolyElement.__eq__(p1, p2) with:
- p1 = {"_hash": 1651261762238379522} (treated as a PolyElement-like mapping with one key)
- p2 = 1

Step-by-step through the method:

1. if not p2:
   - p2 is 1 (truthy), so this condition is False.

2. elif isinstance(p2, PolyElement) and p2.ring == p1.ring:
   - p2 is an int, not a PolyElement, so this condition is False.

3. elif len(p1) > 1:
   - len(p1) == 1, so 1 > 1 is False.

4. else:
   - The code returns p1.get(p1.ring.zero_monom) == p2.
   - p1 has no 'ring' attribute provided, so p1.ring is effectively absent/None; therefore p1.ring.zero_monom cannot provide a meaningful key and the lookup yields None via p1.get(None).
   - p1.get(None) is None, so comparing None == 1 yields False.

Therefore the method returns False.
