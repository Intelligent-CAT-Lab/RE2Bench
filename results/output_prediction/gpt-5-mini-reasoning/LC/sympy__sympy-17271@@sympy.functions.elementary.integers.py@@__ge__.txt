[THOUGHT]
We execute ceiling.__ge__:

1. The method first checks "if self.args[0] == other and other.is_real:". We do not have any information that self.args[0] equals other ("x") and there's no guarantee other.is_real is True, so this condition does not hold.

2. The second check "if other is S.NegativeInfinity and self.is_real:" also does not hold (other is "x", not NegativeInfinity).

3. Therefore the method falls through to the final return: Ge(self, other, evaluate=False).

So the returned value is the unevaluated relational object Ge(self, x, evaluate=False).
