[THOUGHT]
1. __pow__ checks if n is a Permutation: n is -2 (an int), so not.
2. n = int(n) -> n stays -2.
3. The method returns self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n)).
4. self._array_form is None, self._cyclic_form is None, but _size is 7. In SymPy, when _array_form is absent and size is given, the permutation is the identity of that size, i.e. array_form = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].
5. Raising the identity permutation to any power (including -2) yields the identity permutation again.
6. _af_new constructs a new Permutation with array_form = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] and size = 7.
