[THOUGHT]
1. The top-level check(feature) first tests membership in modules, then codecs, then features.
2. "freetype2" is a known Pillow feature, so the function will go to check_feature("freetype2").
3. check_feature looks up features["freetype2"] -> (module, flag, ver) and attempts to import the given module via __import__(module, fromlist=["PIL"]).
4. If the freetype support C extension/module is not available on the system, importing that module raises ModuleNotFoundError and check_feature returns None.
5. Therefore, the overall check("freetype2") call will return None (indicating unknown/unavailable at import time).
