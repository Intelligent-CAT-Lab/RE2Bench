[THOUGHT]
We run filter_by_substring(strings, substring) which returns [x for x in strings if substring in x].

Given substring = "run".

Check each string:
- "grunt": contains "run" at positions 1-3 ("r","u","n") → include.
- "trumpet": does not contain the sequence "run" → exclude.
- "prune": contains "run" at positions 1-3 → include.
- "gruesome": sequence is "rue", not "run" → exclude.

So the output list is ["grunt", "prune"].

    "output": [
        "grunt",
        "prune"
