[THOUGHT]
1. fit_transform is called with y equal to the array of 30 integers (0s and 1s).
2. column_or_1d(y, warn=True) will convert/validate y to a 1D array with the same sequence of values.
3. _unique is called with return_inverse=True on that numeric array. The unique sorted classes are [0, 1].
4. The inverse mapping maps each original value to its index in classes: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 1. That yields an array identical in values to the original array.
5. fit_transform assigns self.classes_ = array([0, 1]) and returns the inverse array (which is the same sequence of 0s and 1s).

Therefore the returned array is the same as the input sequence:
array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
       0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
