[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d from input and prints the maximum of the four products: a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.

The provided input string (after unescaping) is:
193944314 586260100 -192321079 95834122

So:
a = 193944314
b = 586260100
c = -192321079
d = 95834122

Compute the four products:
a * c = 193,944,314 * (-192,321,079) -> negative (we don't need exact value to compare, but it's negative)
a * d = 193,944,314 * 95,834,122 -> positive
b * c = 586,260,100 * (-192,321,079) -> negative
b * d = 586,260,100 * 95,834,122 -> positive

Since d > 0, the larger of a*d and b*d is b*d (because b > a). Thus the maximum is b * d.

Now compute b * d precisely:
586,260,100 * 95,834,122
= 586,260,100 * (95,000,000 + 834,122)
= 586,260,100 * 95,000,000 + 586,260,100 * 834,122
= 55,694,709,500,000,000 + 489,012,447,132,200
= 56,183,721,947,132,200

So the program will print:
56183721947132200
