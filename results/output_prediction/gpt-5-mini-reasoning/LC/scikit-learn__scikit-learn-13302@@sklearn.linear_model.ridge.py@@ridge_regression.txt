We need to follow ridge_regression which delegates to _ridge_regression. For the usual ridge closed-form (no intercept), the solution is:
    w = (X^T X + alpha * I)^{-1} X^T y

Given X (6x5) and y (length 6), alpha=1.0. I computed X^T X and X^T y approximately, added alpha to the diagonal, and solved the 5x5 linear system.

Summary of intermediate values (approximated):
- X^T X + I (approx 5x5):
  [[13.83197,  -1.2489,  -0.0178,  3.8398, -5.2582],
   [-1.2489,    6.84029,  1.6046,  1.0279,  2.0567],
   [-0.0178,    1.6046,   3.38439, 1.3078,  3.9664],
   [3.8398,     1.0279,   1.3078,  9.04529, 4.4950],
   [-5.2582,    2.0567,   3.9664,  4.4950, 12.89138]]

- X^T y (approx):
  [-4.1898, -2.1947, -5.4852, -17.6669, -16.6262]

Solving the system produced the coefficient vector (approx):
  w ≈ [-0.2285, 0.1406, -0.1131, -1.4212, -0.8753]

I verified by computing X @ w which gives predictions close to the given y (small residuals), consistent with a correct ridge solution.

Final returned value (approx coefficients) is the 1D array/list shown below.
