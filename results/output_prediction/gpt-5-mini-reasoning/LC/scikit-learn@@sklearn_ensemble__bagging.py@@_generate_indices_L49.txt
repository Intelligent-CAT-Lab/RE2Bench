[THOUGHT]
- The function checks bootstrap; since bootstrap is true, it uses random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples).
- That calls randint(0, 4, 1) on the provided RandomState instance.
- That returns a 1-element array with a single integer in {0,1,2,3}. For the given RandomState instance, the produced value is 3, so the returned array is [3].

[OUTPUT]

{
    "output": [3]
}
