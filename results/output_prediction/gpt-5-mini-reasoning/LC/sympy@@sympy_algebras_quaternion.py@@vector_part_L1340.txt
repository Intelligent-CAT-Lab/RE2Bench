[THOUGHT]
We call Quaternion.vector_part(self).

1. vector_part executes: return Quaternion(0, self.b, self.c, self.d)
2. To evaluate the arguments, Python will evaluate self.b first. The property b is defined as: return self.args[1]
3. The provided "self" object in the input has only "_real_field" and "_norm" attributes; it does not have an "args" attribute.
4. Accessing self.args will raise an AttributeError ("'Quaternion' object has no attribute 'args'"), so evaluation of vector_part fails before creating a new Quaternion.

Therefore the call raises an AttributeError with that message.
