[THOUGHT]
The setup function calls app.add_post_transform twice (with ImageDownloader and DataURIExtractor) and then returns the ExtensionMetadata dict {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}. The provided app value is a SphinxTestApp representation; add_post_transform calls will succeed (no return value needed). So the output is the returned dict with version "builtin" and both parallel flags True.

{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
