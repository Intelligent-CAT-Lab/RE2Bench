[THOUGHT]
We call check_in with room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1".

1. First line checks if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys().
   - self.booked_rooms.keys() is {"single"}; "single" is present, so this condition is False and we do not return False.

2. Next line checks if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type].
   - self.booked_rooms["single"] is an empty dict {}, so "guest 1" is not present. That condition is False.
   - Because the if block is skipped, none of its branches execute (no returns, no modifications).

3. The method has no further code and no explicit return at the end, so it returns None (Python's implicit return).

Therefore the output is null in JSON (corresponding to Python None).
