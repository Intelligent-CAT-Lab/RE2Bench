[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers S and W from a single line, compares them, and prints 'unsafe' if S <= W, otherwise 'safe'.

Given the input line "74 74", the two integers parsed are S = 74 and W = 74. Since 74 <= 74 is true, the program will print:
unsafe

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "unsafe"
}
```
