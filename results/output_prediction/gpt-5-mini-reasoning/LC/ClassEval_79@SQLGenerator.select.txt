[THOUGHT]
We call select with self.table_name = "table1", fields unspecified (None), and condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".

1. fields is None, so fields is set to '*'.
2. sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}' -> "SELECT * FROM table1"
3. condition is not None, so append " WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"
4. return sql + ';' -> "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
}
```
