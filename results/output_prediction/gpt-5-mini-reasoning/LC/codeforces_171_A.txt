[THOUGHT]
The program:
1. Reads a single line and splits it into a and b. The provided input line is 982906996 135497281, so a = "982906996", b = "135497281".
2. b[::-1] reverses the string "135497281" -> "182794531". int(...) converts it to integer 182,794,531.
3. int(a) is 982,906,996. The program prints the sum: 982,906,996 + 182,794,531 = 1,165,701,527.
So the output printed is "1165701527".
