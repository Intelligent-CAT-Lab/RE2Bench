[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads two integers a and b from input via input().split().
2. The provided input is "\"80 970\"" which represents the line: 80 970 (i.e., a = 80, b = 970).
3. Initialize x = a = 80, h = 0, s = 0.
4. First while loop runs while x > 0. It runs 80 iterations; each iteration decrements x by 1 and increments h and s by 1. After this loop: x = 0, h = 80, s = 80.
5. Second while loop condition is while s // b != 0. Compute s // b = 80 // 970 = 0, so the condition is false and the loop body does not execute.
6. The program prints h, which is 80.
