[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate DocFileHandler.add_heading(self, heading, level=1) with self.file_path = "test_example.docx" and heading = "Test Heading 5".

Steps:
1. The method tries to open the file with doc = Document(self.file_path). The python-docx Document(path) constructor attempts to open an existing .docx package. If the file does not exist or is not a valid .docx, this call will raise an exception (e.g., PackageNotFoundError / OSError / zipfile.BadZipFile).
2. If opening succeeds, the code calls doc.add_heading(heading, level), then doc.save(self.file_path), and returns True.
3. Any exception during open/add/save is caught by the except: block, causing the method to return False.

Because we are not given that "test_example.docx" exists or is a valid .docx, the safe assumption is that opening the file will fail and an exception will be raised; the method will catch it and return False.
