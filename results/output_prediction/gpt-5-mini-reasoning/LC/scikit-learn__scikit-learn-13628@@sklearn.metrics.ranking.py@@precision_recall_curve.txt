[THOUGHT]
We call precision_recall_curve(y_true=None, probas_pred=None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None).
- precision_recall_curve immediately calls _binary_clf_curve(y_true, y_score, pos_label=pos_label, sample_weight=sample_weight) with y_true=None and y_score=None.
- Inside _binary_clf_curve the first step is y_type = type_of_target(y_true).
- type_of_target(None) checks whether the input is array-like. For None, valid becomes False and the function raises:
  ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y)
  with y being None.
- Therefore a ValueError is raised and propagated out of precision_recall_curve; no return value is produced.

So the call results in a ValueError with message: "Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None".
