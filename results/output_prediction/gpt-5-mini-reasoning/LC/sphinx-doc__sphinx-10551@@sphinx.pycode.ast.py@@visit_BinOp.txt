[THOUGHT]
1. The method checks if isinstance(node.op, ast.Pow). In the input, node.op is represented as a plain dict ({}), so this is False.
2. The method returns ' '.join((self.visit(e) for e in [node.left, node.op, node.right])) — i.e., it will concatenate the unparsed left, operator, and right with spaces.
3. Given the AST-like inputs:
   - node.left is a Name with id "int", so self.visit(node.left) would yield "int".
   - node.op corresponds to a bitwise-or / union operator, so self.visit(node.op) would yield "|" (the operator symbol).
   - node.right is a Constant with value None, so self.visit(node.right) would yield "None".
4. Joining those with spaces gives: "int | None".
