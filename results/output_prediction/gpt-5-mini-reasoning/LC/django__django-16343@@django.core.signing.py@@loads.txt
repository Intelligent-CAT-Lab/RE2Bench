[THOUGHT]
1. loads(...) constructs a TimestampSigner and calls its unsign_object method with the signed string.
2. The signed string is of the form "<payload>:<timestamp>:<signature>".
   - payload = "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9"
   - timestamp = "1u7SIo"
   - signature = "wF3XgnVXy3Uny-ff_G2pL1VcbThKPy56l3Vn9gnoLso"
3. The payload is base64. Decoding "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9" yields the bytes for the JSON string: {"a":"dictionary"}.
4. The serializer (JSONSerializer) loads that JSON string to the Python object: {"a": "dictionary"}.
5. Assuming the timestamp/signature verification succeeds (the signed string is intended to be valid), unsign_object returns the deserialized object.
6. Therefore the result a is "dictionary".
