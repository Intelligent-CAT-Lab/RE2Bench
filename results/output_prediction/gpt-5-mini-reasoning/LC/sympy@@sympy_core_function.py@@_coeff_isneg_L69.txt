[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate _coeff_isneg(a) for a = cos(2*phi)/2.

1. The expression cos(2*phi)/2 in SymPy is represented as a Mul (multiplication) of the rational number 1/2 and cos(2*phi), i.e. Mul(Rational(1, 2), cos(2*phi)). Therefore a.is_MatMul is False and a.is_Mul is True.
2. Since a.is_Mul is True, the code sets a = a.args[0]. For a Mul, SymPy orders numeric factors first, so a.args[0] will be Rational(1, 2).
3. Now a is the number 1/2. a.is_Number is True, but a.is_extended_negative is False because 1/2 is positive.
4. The function returns a.is_Number and a.is_extended_negative, which evaluates to True and False -> False.

So the function returns False.
