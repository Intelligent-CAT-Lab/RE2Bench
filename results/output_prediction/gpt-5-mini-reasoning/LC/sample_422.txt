[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives array = [1, 2, 1].
2. new_array = array.copy() creates a shallow copy: new_array = [1, 2, 1].
3. new_array = reversed(new_array) replaces the list with a list_reverseiterator that will iterate the elements in reverse order. For [1, 2, 1], the reversed order is [1, 2, 1] (same because it's symmetric).
4. The list comprehension [x * x for x in new_array] iterates over the reversed iterator and squares each element:
   - first x = 1 -> 1*1 = 1
   - second x = 2 -> 2*2 = 4
   - third x = 1 -> 1*1 = 1
5. The function returns [1, 4, 1].
