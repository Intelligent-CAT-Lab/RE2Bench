[THOUGHT]
We call f with nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], idx = 2, added = 3.

1. The assignment nums[idx:idx] = (added,) is a slice assignment that replaces the empty slice at position idx with the tuple (3,), effectively inserting 3 at index 2.
2. Inserting 3 at index 2 shifts the original elements from index 2 onward to the right.
   - Before: [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
   - After inserting 3 at index 2: [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]
3. The function returns the modified list [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3].
