[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate DiscountStrategy.due() with the provided self state.

- The instance has a private total stored as _DiscountStrategy__total = 150.0, so self.__total is 150.0.
- promotion is present (not None). In the original promotions example, the provided promotion wrapper is the "best promotion" that returns the largest discount among available promotions:
  - fidelity_promo: customer fidelity 1200 -> 5% of total = 0.05 * 150.0 = 7.5
  - bulk_item_promo: no line has quantity >= 20, so yields 0.0
  - large_order_promo: 15 distinct items -> qualifies (>=10), gives 7% of total = 0.07 * 150.0 = 10.5
- The best promotion returns the maximum discount = 10.5.

Therefore due() returns total - discount = 150.0 - 10.5 = 139.5.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": 139.5        
}
