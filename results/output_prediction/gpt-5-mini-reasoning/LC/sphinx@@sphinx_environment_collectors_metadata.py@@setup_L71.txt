[THOUGHT]
1. The setup function is called with app set to a Sphinx application instance.
2. setup calls app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector). According to the provided add_env_collector implementation, this will instantiate the collector and call its enable(self) method on the app; this is a side-effect and does not affect setup's return value.
3. After that call, setup returns the literal dictionary: {'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}.
4. Therefore the output fields are version = "builtin", parallel_read_safe = True, parallel_write_safe = True.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
