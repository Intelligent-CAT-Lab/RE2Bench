[THOUGHT]
The method _eval_expand_trig simply does: return self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)

We are not given an implementation of _calculate_reciprocal, and there is no hint that calling it would mutate the nargs._args_set. Given the provided input only includes self.nargs._args_set = "{'1'}" and no hints, the safest prediction is that nargs._args_set remains unchanged.

Therefore the output preserves nargs._args_set as "{'1'}".
