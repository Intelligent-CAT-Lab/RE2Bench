[THOUGHT]
We call f([]).
1. First loop: while -1 in array — array is empty, so -1 not in array; loop body not executed.
2. Second loop: while 0 in array — array is empty, so 0 not in array; loop body not executed.
3. Third loop: while 1 in array — array is empty, so 1 not in array; loop body not executed.
No modifications done; function returns the original empty list [].
