[THOUGHT]
We call ComplexCalculator.subtract(c1, c2). The method computes:
- real = c1.real - c2.real
- imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag
- returns complex(real, imaginary)

Interpreting the inputs as complex numbers:
- c1 = (-1+2j) -> real part = -1, imag part = 2
- c2 = (-3+4j) -> real part = -3, imag part = 4

Compute:
- real = -1 - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2
- imaginary = 2 - 4 = -2

Return complex(2, -2), which is represented as (2-2j) in Python.
