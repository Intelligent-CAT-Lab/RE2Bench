[THOUGHT]
We call compare(game, guess), which returns [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)].

Step through zip pairs:
- Pair 1: x=1, y=-1 => x - y = 1 - (-1) = 2 => abs(2) = 2
- Pair 2: x=2, y=2  => x - y = 0 => abs(0) = 0
- Pair 3: x=3, y=3  => x - y = 0 => abs(0) = 0
- Pair 4: x=5, y=4  => x - y = 1 => abs(1) = 1

The resulting list is [2, 0, 0, 1].
