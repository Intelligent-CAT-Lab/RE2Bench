[THOUGHT]
We call sstr(expr, order=None). sstr constructs a StrPrinter with the provided settings and calls p.doprint(expr), which calls Printer._print on the expr and then converts the result to str.

The printer finds a _print_Permutation method for this object. The Permutation instance has attributes _array_form = None and _size = 6. The printer's logic for a permutation when the permutation has no nontrivial support is to return either the explicit array_form for small sizes or the compact form "Permutation([], size=%s)" for larger sizes.

Here the permutation has no support (array_form is effectively empty / no moved points) and size is 6 (>= 5), so the StrPrinter will produce the string:
"Permutation([], size=6)"

Therefore sstr returns that string.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Permutation([], size=6)"
