[THOUGHT]
The program reads three integers from stdin with input().split().
The provided input is "1 0 1", which parses to N=1, A=0, B=1.

Compute:
A + B = 0 + 1 = 1
N // (A + B) = 1 // 1 = 1
ans = 1 * A = 1 * 0 = 0
rem = N % (A + B) = 1 % 1 = 0
ans += min(rem, A) = 0 + min(0, 0) = 0

The program prints 0.
