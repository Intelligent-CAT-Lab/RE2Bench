[THOUGHT]
We call greatest_common_divisor(10, 15).

Initial values: a = 10, b = 15.

Iteration 1:
- b is 15 (truthy), compute (b, a % b) -> (15, 10 % 15) = (15, 10).
- Now a = 15, b = 10.

Iteration 2:
- b is 10, compute (b, a % b) -> (10, 15 % 10) = (10, 5).
- Now a = 10, b = 5.

Iteration 3:
- b is 5, compute (b, a % b) -> (5, 10 % 5) = (5, 0).
- Now a = 5, b = 0.

Loop ends (b is 0). Return a, which is 5.
