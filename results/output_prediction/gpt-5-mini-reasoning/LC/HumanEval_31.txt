[THOUGHT]
1. The function is_prime checks if n < 2; for n = 13441 this is false, so continue.
2. It loops k over range(2, n-1), i.e., k = 2, 3, ..., 13439, checking if n % k == 0.
3. To decide the result, we need to know whether any k in that range divides 13441. It's sufficient to check divisors up to sqrt(13441) ≈ 115.97. I test primes up to 113:
   - 2: no (n is odd).
   - 3: digit sum 13 → not divisible.
   - 5: last digit not 0 or 5.
   - 7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,101,103,107,109,113: none divide 13441 (checked by quick division/remainders).
4. Since no divisor ≤ 115 exists, 13441 has no nontrivial divisor in the checked range, so the loop never finds n % k == 0 and the function returns True.
