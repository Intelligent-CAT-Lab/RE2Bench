[THOUGHT]
We call add_item on a VendingMachine whose inventory already contains "Coke" with quantity 20.

1. add_item calls self.restock_item("Coke", 10).
2. restock_item sees "Coke" in inventory, increments its quantity by 10 (20 -> 30), and returns True.
3. Back in add_item, the if condition is `if not self.restock_item(...):` — since restock_item returned True, the body is skipped and add_item does not set a new dict.
4. add_item has no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null).

Note: inventory is mutated so "Coke" now has quantity 30 and price remains 1.25.
