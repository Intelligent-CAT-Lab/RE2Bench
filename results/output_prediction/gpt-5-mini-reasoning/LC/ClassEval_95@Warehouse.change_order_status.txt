[THOUGHT]
We call change_order_status with order_id = 1 (an int) and status = "Delivered". The method checks "if order_id in self.orders". self.orders keys in the provided self are strings: "1". In Python, the int 1 is not equal to the string "1", so the membership test fails. Therefore the else branch is executed and the method returns False.
