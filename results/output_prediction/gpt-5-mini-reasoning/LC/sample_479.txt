[THOUGHT]
Step-by-step execution:
1. Initial nums = [1, 2, 3], pop1 = 2, pop2 = 4.
2. First operation: nums.pop(pop1 - 1) -> nums.pop(1). This removes the element at index 1 (the value 2). After this, nums becomes [1, 3].
3. Second operation: nums.pop(pop2 - 1) -> nums.pop(3). Now nums has length 2 (valid indices 0 and 1). Index 3 is out of range, so Python raises an IndexError with the message "pop index out of range".
4. The function does not return a value because it raises this exception.

Therefore the result is an IndexError: pop index out of range.
