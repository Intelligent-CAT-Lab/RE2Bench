[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input list nums is [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3].
2. len(nums) = 7, so range(len(nums) - 1) = range(6) — the loop will run 6 iterations.
3. Each iteration calls nums.reverse(), which reverses the list in place. Reversing is an involution: applying reverse twice returns the list to its previous order.
4. Since 6 is even, after 6 reversals the list will be back to its original order.
5. Therefore the function returns the original list: [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3].
