[THOUGHT]
We run LRASolver._assert_lower with:
- self.result = None
- run_checks = False
- xi = x
- ci = (0, 0)
- from_equality = True
- from_neg = False

Step-by-step:
1. The method checks if self.result: it's None, so skip the assertion.
2. It sets self.result = None (no change).
3. It checks if ci <= xi.lower. No xi.lower is provided in the input, but in normal initialization xi.lower will be less than or equal to (0,0) (e.g. -oo), so this comparison is False and we continue.
4. It checks if ci > xi.upper. Again xi.upper would normally be >= (0,0) (e.g. +oo), so this is False.
5. It assigns xi.lower = ci, xi.lower_from_eq = True, xi.lower_from_neg = False.
6. Since xi is in nonslack, it would check whether xi.assign < ci; whether that triggers an update depends on xi.assign (not provided). If an update is needed, _update would update slack variables (there are none) and set xi.assign = ci.
7. run_checks is False, so the final matrix consistency check is skipped.
8. The method returns None (no explicit result produced).

Therefore the output of the call is None (null in JSON).
