[THOUGHT]
1. simple_tag is called with func = {} (a dict), takes_context = None, name = None.
2. The method checks:
   - if func is None: (false, since func is a dict)
   - elif callable(func): (false, dict is not callable)
   - else: raise ValueError('Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag')
3. Therefore the call raises a ValueError with that message and does not return a value.
4. The provided output structure has no placeholders to fill, so we output the empty JSON object as given.
