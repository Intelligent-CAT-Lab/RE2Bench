[THOUGHT]
1. The function begins by setting local flags and an empty list: rationals = floats = complexes = algebraics = False; float_numbers = [].
2. Next it evaluates "if opt.extension is True:". In the provided input, opt is {} (a Python dict), not an object with attributes.
3. Accessing opt.extension on a dict triggers an AttributeError before any iteration or further logic occurs.
4. The exception raised is AttributeError with message "'dict' object has no attribute 'extension'".
Therefore the function does not return a normal value but raises that AttributeError.
