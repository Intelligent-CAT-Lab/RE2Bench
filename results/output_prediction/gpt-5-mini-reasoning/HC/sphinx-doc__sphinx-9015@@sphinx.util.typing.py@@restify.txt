[THOUGHT]
We call restify(cls) with cls being a JSON object (a Python dict in the simulated environment) with keys "__module__": "tests.test_util_typing" and "__doc__": None.

Step-by-step:
1. The function checks if cls is None or NoneType — it's not.
2. Checks if cls is Ellipsis — it's not.
3. Next it evaluates "elif cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:". This attempts to use the dict (cls) as a key lookup against the dict INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES. Membership testing "in" on a dict will attempt to hash the left-hand operand (cls) to compare to keys. A plain dict is unhashable in Python, so this raises a TypeError: "unhashable type: 'dict'".

Because this exception occurs at that point, restify does not return a normal string — it raises TypeError and halts execution.
