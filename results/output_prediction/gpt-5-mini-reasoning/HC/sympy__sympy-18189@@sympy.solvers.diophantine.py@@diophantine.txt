[THOUGHT]
We call diophantine(eq="8*x*y + z**2").

1. diophantine begins by checking if isinstance(eq, Eq) — it's a Python string, so False.
2. Then it enters the try block and attempts: var = list(eq.expand(force=True).free_symbols)
   - A Python str has no expand attribute, so calling eq.expand(...) raises AttributeError.
3. The except clause catches AttributeError (it's in the except tuple) and raises a TypeError with the message:
   "Equation should be a polynomial with Rational coefficients."

Therefore diophantine will not return normally but will raise a TypeError with that message.
