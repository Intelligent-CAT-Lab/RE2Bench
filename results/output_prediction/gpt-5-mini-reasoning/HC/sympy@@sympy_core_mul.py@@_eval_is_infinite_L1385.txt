[THOUGHT]
We are calling Mul._eval_is_infinite on self = pi/2.

1. For Mul, args are (pi, 1/2) (i.e. pi and Rational(1, 2)).
2. _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper initializes seen_zero = seen_infinite = False.
3. Examine first arg a = pi:
   - a.is_zero is False.
   - a.is_infinite is False.
   - Since neither is None, neither seen_zero nor seen_infinite change (remain False).
4. Examine second arg a = 1/2:
   - a.is_zero is False.
   - a.is_infinite is False.
   - Again neither flag changes; seen_zero and seen_infinite remain False.
5. Helper returns (seen_zero, seen_infinite) = (False, False).
6. _eval_is_infinite then checks:
   - seen_infinite is True and seen_zero is False? No.
   - seen_infinite is False? Yes → return False.

So the result is the boolean False.
