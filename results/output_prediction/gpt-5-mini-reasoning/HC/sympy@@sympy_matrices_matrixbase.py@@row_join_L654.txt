[THOUGHT]
We call row_join with self a 2x2 identity and other likewise a 2x2 identity.

1. Check first conditional: self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows. Here self.cols == 2, so that branch is skipped.
2. Next check: if self.rows != other.rows: both are 2, so they match and no ShapeError is raised.
3. Call self._eval_row_join(other). For repmatrix this delegates to self._fromrep(self._rep.hstack(other._rep)), i.e. a horizontal stack of the two 2x2 identity matrices.
4. The resulting matrix is 2 rows by 4 columns:
   - Row 0: [1, 0] concatenated with [1, 0] -> [1, 0, 1, 0]
   - Row 1: [0, 1] concatenated with [0, 1] -> [0, 1, 0, 1]

So the output is the 2x4 matrix:
Matrix([
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 1]])
