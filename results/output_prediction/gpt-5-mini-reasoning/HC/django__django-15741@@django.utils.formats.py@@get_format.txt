[THOUGHT]
1. get_format is called with format_type = "jS \\o\\f F" and use_l10n = None.
2. Since use_l10n is None, the code tries to get settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL. Accessing that on the LazySettings object returns a bound method object (truthy), so use_l10n evaluates as True.
3. Because use_l10n is truthy and lang is None, lang is set via get_language(), which resolves to settings.LANGUAGE_CODE (e.g. 'en-us'). The exact language value is irrelevant here.
4. The function attempts to find a localized format value by looking up the given format_type name on format modules for the language. The format_type "jS \\o\\f F" is not a valid setting name and will not be found on those modules, so val stays None.
5. Since val is None and the format_type is not one of the known FORMAT_SETTINGS keys, the function returns the format_type unchanged.
6. Therefore the output is the same string that was passed in: "jS \\o\\f F".
