[THOUGHT]
1. Read inputs: self.estimator is "SVC(kernel='linear')", self.n_features_to_select = 4, self.step = 0.1.
2. validate_data will produce X with shape (n_samples, n_features). From the provided X rows each is [0. 0.], so n_features = 2.
3. Determine n_features_to_select:
   - self.n_features_to_select is an Integral (4), so local n_features_to_select = 4.
   - Since 4 > n_features (2), a warning is emitted and "there will be no feature selection and all features will be kept."
4. Compute step:
   - self.step = 0.1 is in (0.0, 1.0), so step = int(max(1, self.step * n_features)) = int(max(1, 0.1 * 2 = 0.2)) = 1.
5. support_ = array([True, True]) and ranking_ = array([1, 1]); the while loop condition np.sum(support_) > n_features_to_select is 2 > 4 which is False, so loop is skipped.
6. The estimator's kernel (from the provided estimator string) is "linear".
7. The function returns self; relevant outputs are:
   - estimator.kernel -> "linear"
   - n_features_to_select -> 4
   - step -> 1
