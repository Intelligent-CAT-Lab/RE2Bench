[THOUGHT]
We call _BaseComposition._get_params(self, attr="_transformers", deep=False).

1. The method begins by calling super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep), i.e. BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=False), and assigns that to out.
2. Because deep is False, _get_params immediately returns out without any further processing of the attr argument.
3. BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=False) builds a dict of constructor parameters by iterating over parameter names from _get_param_names() and reading the corresponding attributes from self. For this instance, the relevant parameters include "n_jobs", "remainder", "transformer_weights", and "transformers".
4. For each of those keys, the value is taken from the provided self mapping:
   - n_jobs -> 1
   - remainder -> "passthrough"
   - transformer_weights -> null
   - transformers -> null

Thus the returned dict contains those four keys with their corresponding values from self.
