[THOUGHT]
- register is defined to accept *types and **kwargs and returns an inner function _ (a decorator).
- When called with the provided types argument (a single type in the varargs), register does not execute any other logic immediately; it constructs and returns the inner function _.
- The returned value is the decorator function object (the inner function), which when later called with a function will call self.add(types, func, **kwargs) and return the func.
- Therefore the direct output of this call is the inner function object, represented by its Python function repr: "<function Dispatcher.register.<locals>._ ...>".

(Note: exact memory address is omitted; the canonical representation is the function's qualified name.)
