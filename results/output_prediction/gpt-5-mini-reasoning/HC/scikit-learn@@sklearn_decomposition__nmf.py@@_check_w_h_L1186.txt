[THOUGHT]
We call _check_w_h with X = [[1.,1.],[1.,1.]] (a 2x2 float array), W=None, H=None, update_H=True. self.init is None, so the first "custom" branch is skipped. update_H is True, so the "not update_H" branch is skipped. We take the else branch:

- Since W and H are None, no warning.
- self._n_components == 'auto', so set self._n_components = X.shape[1] = 2.
- Call _initialize_nmf(X, n_components=2, init=None, random_state=None).

Inside _initialize_nmf:
- init is None and n_components <= min(n_samples, n_features) (2 <= 2), so init becomes "nndsvda".
- NNDSVD initialization on the all-ones 2x2 matrix yields first singular triplet producing W[:,0]=[1.,1.] and H[0,:]=[1.,1.], while the second components are zero. With init="nndsvda", zeros are filled with X.mean() which is 1.0. So W and H become 2x2 all-ones arrays (dtype float).

Thus _check_w_h returns the pair (W, H) where both are 2x2 arrays of ones:
W = [[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]
H = [[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]
