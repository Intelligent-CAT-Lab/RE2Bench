[THOUGHT]
We call deprecated with the provided arguments. The function deprecated constructs and returns the inner function deprecate (a closure) without invoking it. Therefore the return value is the function object for deprecated.<locals>.deprecate. The exact memory address is not predictable; the canonical representation is the function object repr "<function deprecated.<locals>.deprecate at 0x...>", but we show the stable part without an address.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "<function deprecated.<locals>.deprecate>"
}
```
