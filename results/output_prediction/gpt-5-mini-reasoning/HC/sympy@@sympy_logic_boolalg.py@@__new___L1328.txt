[THOUGHT]
1. Called Equivalent.__new__ with evaluate=None and two string args "Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)" and "Q.even(X*Z)".
2. evaluate is None so it is set to global_parameters.evaluate (default True), so evaluation proceeds.
3. The args are sympified: they become two SymPy boolean expressions: Or(Q.even(X), Q.even(Z)) and Q.even(X*Z).
4. argset = set(args) produces a set of these two distinct expressions.
5. The code collects relational info only for Relational instances; neither expression is a Relational, so no relational simplifications apply.
6. argset has length 2 (>1) and contains neither True nor False, so it proceeds to create the Equivalent node with the ordered arguments.
7. ordered(argset) will place the simpler atomic predicate Q.even(X*Z) before the Or(...) expression (Or has more nodes), so the ordered sequence is [Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)].
8. Therefore the method returns an Equivalent object equivalent to Equivalent(Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z)), and its string representation is "Equivalent(Q.even(X*Z), Q.even(X) | Q.even(Z))".
