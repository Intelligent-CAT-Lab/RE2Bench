[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Pow._eval_is_finite for self = cos(phi)**2.

1. base = cos(phi), exp = 2.

2. Check if exp.is_negative: for exp = 2 this is False, so the first if-block (handling negative exponents) is skipped.

3. c1 = base.is_finite: cos(phi) is a trigonometric function and is finite (sympy treats cos(...) as finite), so c1 is True.

4. c2 = exp.is_finite: exp = 2 is a finite integer, so c2 is True.

5. Since c1 and c2 are both True, evaluate the inner condition:
   - exp.is_nonnegative is True for 2 (nonnegative), so the condition (self.exp.is_nonnegative or fuzzy_not(self.base.is_zero)) is True (short-circuits on the first True).

6. Therefore the method returns True.
