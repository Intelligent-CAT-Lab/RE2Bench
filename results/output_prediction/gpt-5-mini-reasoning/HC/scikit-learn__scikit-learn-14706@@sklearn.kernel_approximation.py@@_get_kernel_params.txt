1. _get_kernel_params starts with params = self.kernel_params. Input has kernel_params = null -> params = None.
2. Since params is None, it sets params = {} (an empty dict).
3. self.kernel is the string "polynomial", which is not callable and not equal to 'precomputed', so it enters the for-loop over KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel].
4. KERNEL_PARAMS['polynomial'] contains the names of relevant kernel parameters (gamma, coef0, degree). The method checks each with getattr(self, param) and, if not None, adds it to params.
5. From the input: self.gamma is null -> None (so omitted), self.coef0 is 0.1 (included), self.degree is 3.1 (included).
6. The final params dict returned is {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}.
