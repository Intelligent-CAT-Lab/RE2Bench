[THOUGHT]
1. The method receives sharex=False, sharey=False, squeeze=True, subplot_kw=None and the GridSpec has _nrows=1, _ncols=1 and a non-None figure ("<Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes>").
2. figure = self.figure is not None, so we continue.
3. Since sharex and sharey are not strings, they are converted:
   - sharex = 'all' if False else 'none' -> 'none'
   - sharey = 'all' if False else 'none' -> 'none'
4. _api.check_in_list verifies 'none' is in the allowed list for both sharex and sharey — OK.
5. subplot_kw is None, so it becomes an empty dict {} and is copied.
6. axarr is created as a numpy empty object array of shape (1, 1).
7. Looping over the single cell (row=0, col=0):
   - shared_with mapping is built but since sharex and sharey are 'none', subplot_kw['sharex']=None and subplot_kw['sharey']=None.
   - self[row, col] produces a SubplotSpec corresponding to the single cell (flattened indices 0,0 -> SubplotSpec(...)).
   - figure.add_subplot(self[row, col], sharex=None, sharey=None) creates an Axes (an AxesSubplot) and stores it into axarr[0,0].
8. After the loop, neither sharex nor sharey trigger the outer-label logic because both are 'none'.
9. squeeze is True and axarr.size == 1, so the method returns the single Axes object (not an array).
10. The typical string representation of such an Axes object is "<AxesSubplot:>".

Therefore the returned value is the single Axes instance, represented as the string "<AxesSubplot:>".
