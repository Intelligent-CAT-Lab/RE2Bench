[THOUGHT]
1. fit_transform starts. _routing_enabled() is False (default), so the else branch executes and routed_params is built:
   - For each (name, obj) in transformer_list, it checks hasattr(obj, 'fit_transform').
   - The provided transformers are plain strings ("SimpleImputer(...)" and "MissingIndicator()"), so they do not have fit/transform methods. routed_params entries are created but that doesn't affect the next steps.

2. fit_transform calls self._parallel_func(...). Inside _parallel_func:
   - It converts transformer_list to a list and calls self._validate_transformers().

3. _validate_transformers iterates over transformers (the objects from transformer_list). For each transformer t:
   - It checks if t is 'drop' or 'passthrough' — they are not.
   - Then it checks if t has fit or fit_transform and also has transform. Since t is a string, it does not have these attributes.

4. Because the transformer is invalid (a string), _validate_transformers raises a TypeError with the message formatted as:
   "All estimators should implement fit and transform. '%s' (type %s) doesn't" % (t, type(t))
   For the first transformer this becomes:
   "All estimators should implement fit and transform. 'SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')' (type <class 'str'>) doesn't"

5. Therefore fit_transform does not return a transformed array; it raises the above TypeError.
