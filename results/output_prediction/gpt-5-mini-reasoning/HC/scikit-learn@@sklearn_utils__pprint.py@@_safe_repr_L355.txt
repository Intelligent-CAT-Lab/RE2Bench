[THOUGHT]
We call _safe_repr with object = "dictionary" (a Python str), context contains a string key but that doesn't matter, maxlevels is None, level=1, changed_only=True.

1. typ = type(object) -> str.
2. The function checks if typ in pprint._builtin_scalars. Strings are included in pprint._builtin_scalars, so this branch is taken.
3. It returns (repr(object), True, False). repr("dictionary") is the string "'dictionary'".
4. So the function returns the 3-tuple: ("'dictionary'", True, False). Represented in JSON as an array: ["'dictionary'", true, false].

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["'dictionary'", true, false]
}
