We run IncrementalPCA.fit on the full 150x4 Iris-like dataset with n_components=2 and batch_size=50. The fit() method splits the 150 samples into three batches of 50 each and calls partial_fit on each batch, updating running mean/variance and computing SVD-based updates.

- After the first batch, the model initializes components_, singular_values_, mean_, var_, explained_variance_, explained_variance_ratio_, noise_variance_, and sets n_samples_seen_ to 50.
- The second and third batches update these attributes using _incremental_mean_and_var and an SVD on the stacked matrix that includes previous singular modes, the centered new batch, and a mean-correction row.
- The final result after processing all 150 samples matches the standard PCA results commonly reported for the Iris dataset with 2 components. These known values are:

  - mean_ (feature means): approximately [5.84333333, 3.05733333, 3.758, 1.19933333]
  - var_ (feature variances): approximately [0.68569351, 0.18997942, 3.11627785, 0.58100667]
  - components_ (2 principal axes): approximately
      [[ 0.36138659, -0.08452251,  0.85667061,  0.3582892 ],
       [ 0.65658877,  0.73016143, -0.17337266, -0.07548102]]
  - explained_variance_: approximately [4.22824171, 0.24267075]
  - explained_variance_ratio_: approximately [0.92461872, 0.05306648]
  - singular_values_ (corresponding singular values for components): approximately [25.099, 6.013]
  - noise_variance_ (mean of remaining variances): approximately 0.0510223
  - n_samples_seen_ becomes 150, batch_size_ is 50, and n_components_ is 2.

These values are the well-known PCA results on the Iris dataset and are what IncrementalPCA.fit will produce after the three incremental updates with the provided parameters.
