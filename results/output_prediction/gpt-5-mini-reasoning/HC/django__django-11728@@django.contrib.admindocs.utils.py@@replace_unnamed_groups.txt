[THOUGHT]
1. The function searches for '(' characters. The pattern "^a/?$" contains no '(' so unnamed_group_indices = [].
2. With no unnamed_group_indices, group_indices and group_start_end_indices stay empty.
3. Since group_start_end_indices is empty, the function returns the original pattern unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "^a/?$"        
}
