[THOUGHT]
We call StrPrinter._print_Pow with expr = sqrt(2) (i.e. Pow(2, S.Half)) and rational = False.
1. PREC = precedence(expr) is computed but not needed because the first check applies.
2. The code checks if expr.exp is S.Half and not rational. That is true, so it returns "sqrt(%s)" % self._print(expr.base).
3. expr.base is the integer 2. self._print(2) will produce "2".
4. Thus the final returned string is "sqrt(2)".
