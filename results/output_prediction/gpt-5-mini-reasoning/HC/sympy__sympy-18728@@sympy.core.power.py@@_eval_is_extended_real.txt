[THOUGHT]
The method begins by accessing self.base.is_extended_real. Given the provided "self" is an empty dict ({}), attribute access like self.base will raise an AttributeError because dict objects do not have attribute access for arbitrary keys. Therefore the function will not execute further and Python will raise:

AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'base'
[/THOUGHT]
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'base'"
}
```
