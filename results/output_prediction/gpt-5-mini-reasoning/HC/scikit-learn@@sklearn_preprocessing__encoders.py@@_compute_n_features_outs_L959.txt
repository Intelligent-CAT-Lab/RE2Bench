[THOUGHT]
We execute _compute_n_features_outs step by step.

1. First line: output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_]
   - self.categories_ is ["['a', 'b']"] — a list with a single element that is a string "['a', 'b']".
   - For that string, len("['a', 'b']") counts characters: '[' (1), "'" (2), 'a' (3), "'" (4), ',' (5), ' ' (6), "'" (7), 'b' (8), "'" (9), ']' (10). So len(...) == 10.
   - Thus output = [10].

2. Next, the code checks if self._drop_idx_after_grouping is not None. Here it is null (None), so this block is skipped.

3. Then it checks if not self._infrequent_enabled. Input has "_infrequent_enabled": false, so this condition is true and the method returns output as-is.

Therefore the returned value is [10].
