[THOUGHT]
1. _route_params is called with params containing sample_weight: [1], metadata: "a".
2. _check_warnings is invoked; _requests aliases are True for both keys, so nothing with WARN, no warnings affect behavior.
3. args = {arg: value for arg, value in params.items() if value is not None} -> args stays {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}.
4. res = Bunch() (an empty mapping-like object).
5. Iterate over self._requests items in insertion order:
   - prop="sample_weight", alias=True: since alias is True and prop in args, set res["sample_weight"] = [1].
   - prop="metadata", alias=True: since alias is True and prop in args, set res["metadata"] = "a".
6. unrequested remains empty, so no UnsetMetadataPassedError is raised.
7. The method returns res containing both keys with their values.

Therefore the output mapping is sample_weight -> [1], metadata -> "a".
