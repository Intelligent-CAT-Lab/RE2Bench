[THOUGHT]
We call MigrationWriter.as_string.

1. The method starts: items = {'replaces_str': '', 'initial_str': ''} and imports, operations lists.
2. It then does: for operation in self.migration.operations:
   - In the provided input, self.migration.operations is null (i.e. None).
   - Iterating "for operation in None" raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
3. Therefore as_string does not complete and raises that TypeError.

The function does not return a string; it raises a TypeError with message "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
