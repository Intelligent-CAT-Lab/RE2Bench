[THOUGHT]
1. simplify() first calls sympify on the input string. The input string
   ("exp(x)" + "exp(-x)")/(y*("exp(x)" - "exp(-x)"))
   is parsed into the SymPy expression (exp(x) + exp(-x)) / (y*(exp(x) - exp(-x))).

2. Algebraically:
   (exp(x) + exp(-x)) / (exp(x) - exp(-x)) = coth(x),
   so the whole expression becomes coth(x) / y.

3. The simplify function applies a sequence of normalization/rewriting steps and returns the simplified form coth(x)/y.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "coth(x)/y"        
}
```
