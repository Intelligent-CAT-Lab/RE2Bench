[THOUGHT]
1. __getitem__ starts by calling get_geometry(), which returns (self._nrows, self._ncols) = (1, 1).
2. The provided key is a tuple (0, 0), so k1 = 0, k2 = 0.
3. _normalize(k1, nrows, 0) with key=0 and size=1:
   - key is not a slice, not negative, and 0 <= 0 < 1, so it returns (0, 0).
4. _normalize(k2, ncols, 1) similarly returns (0, 0).
5. np.ravel_multi_index is called with multi-index [(0,0), (0,0)] and dims (1,1). Interpreting these as parallel index arrays, the flattened indices are [0, 0]. These are assigned to num1, num2 -> num1 = 0, num2 = 0.
6. A SubplotSpec is returned constructed as SubplotSpec(self, num1, num2). Its fields are _gridspec (the original GridSpec object) and num1 = 0, num2 = 0.

So the returned object is a SubplotSpec with _gridspec equal to the given GridSpec-like object and num1 and num2 both 0.
