[THOUGHT]
We call to_list(M).

1. Determine shape: M has two top-level keys (0 and 1) and each row has two keys (0 and 1), so shape is m = 2, n = 2.
2. zero = M.domain.zero would be used to initialize the matrix, but every position (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) is provided in M, so the initial zero values will all be overwritten.
3. Build ddm as a 2x2 list and fill entries from M:
   - ddm[0][0] = "Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])"
   - ddm[0][1] = "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"
   - ddm[1][0] = "Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])"
   - ddm[1][1] = "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"

So the output is a 2x2 Python list containing those strings in the corresponding positions.

    "output": [["Matrix([[4, 2],[2, 3],[7, 5]])", "Matrix([[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1]])"], ["Matrix([[1, 0],[0, 1]])", "Matrix([[1, 2, 3],[3, 5, 4]])"]]
}
