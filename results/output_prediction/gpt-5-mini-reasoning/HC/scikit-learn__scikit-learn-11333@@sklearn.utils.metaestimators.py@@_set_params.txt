[THOUGHT]
We simulate _set_params(self, attr="_transformers", **params) step by step with the given input.

1. Initial self attributes:
   - transformers: None
   - remainder: "drop"
   - n_jobs: 1
   - transformer_weights: None

2. The method starts:
   - It checks if attr ("_transformers") is in params. It's not, so nothing is popped.
   - It retrieves items = getattr(self, "_transformers"). In the ColumnTransformer implementation this yields the list of (name, transformer) pairs derived from self.transformers; since self.transformers is null/None, that yields an empty/falsy items (no named transformers).
   - names is initialized to [] and stays [] because items is falsy.

3. It iterates over the keys of params. There's one key: "trans1__with_mean".
   - The loop checks if '__' not in name and name in names. Here the key contains '__', so the condition is false and no estimator replacement occurs; params remains unchanged.

4. Next it calls super(...).set_params(**params). BaseEstimator.set_params:
   - Calls self.get_params(deep=True) to obtain valid_params. That will not contain a top-level key "trans1" (there are no named transformers when transformers is None), so "trans1" is not a valid top-level parameter.
   - Since the incoming param key has a nested form (key partition gives key='trans1', delim='__', sub_key='with_mean'), BaseEstimator.set_params tries to accept nested params only if the top-level 'trans1' is in valid_params.
   - Because 'trans1' is not in valid_params, BaseEstimator.set_params raises a ValueError: "Invalid parameter trans1 for estimator ...".

5. Because a ValueError is raised, _set_params does not complete normally and no attributes on self are modified during this call. Therefore the observed attributes remain as they were originally.

So the final state (unchanged) is:
- transformers: null
- remainder: "drop"
- n_jobs: 1
- transformer_weights: null

Note: the call raises ValueError; no successful return occurs, but the attribute values remain unchanged as shown below.
