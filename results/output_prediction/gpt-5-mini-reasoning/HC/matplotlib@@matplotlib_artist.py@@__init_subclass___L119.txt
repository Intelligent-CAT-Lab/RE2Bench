[THOUGHT]
We call Artist.__init_subclass__(cls) with cls = TestArtist.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The method checks if cls.draw has attribute '_supports_rasterization'. If the subclass did not explicitly mark its draw as supporting rasterization, the test-class draw will be wrapped by _prevent_rasterization and the wrapper will have attribute '_supports_rasterization' set to False. (Either way, this branch doesn't produce a return value; it only replaces cls.draw if needed.)

2. Next it checks if cls.set has attribute '_autogenerated_signature'. If that attribute is not present on cls.set, the method returns early (no further changes are made).

3. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns None.

Given typical test subclasses, the early-return path (step 2) is reached, and the function finishes with no explicit return, so the overall output is None (null in JSON).

Therefore the output is null.
