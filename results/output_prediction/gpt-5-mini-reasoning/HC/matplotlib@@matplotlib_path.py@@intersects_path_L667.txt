[THOUGHT]
1. The method Path.intersects_path simply calls _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled).
2. The "self" vertices describe a segment from (0, 0) to (2, 0) — a horizontal segment along y=0.
3. The "other" path is from (0, 0) to (1.99969539, -0.03490481) — a segment that starts at (0,0) and goes slightly below the x-axis toward x≈2.
4. Both segments share the point (0, 0) (an endpoint), so they intersect.
5. Therefore _path.path_intersects_path(...) would return True.
