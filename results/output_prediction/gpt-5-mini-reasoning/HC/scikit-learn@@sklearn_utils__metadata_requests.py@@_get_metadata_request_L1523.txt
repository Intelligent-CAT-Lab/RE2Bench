[THOUGHT]
1. _get_metadata_request checks if self has attribute '_metadata_request'. The provided input includes "_metadata_request", so the condition is true.
2. It calls get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request). The provided _metadata_request is a plain string (not an object with get_metadata_routing nor with a _type indicating a metadata request/router).
3. get_routing_for_object therefore falls through to returning a new MetadataRequest(owner=None).
4. MetadataRequest(owner=None) initializes by setting owner = None and attaching MethodMetadataRequest instances for each method in SIMPLE_METHODS, but the function returns the MetadataRequest instance itself.
5. So the output is the newly created MetadataRequest with owner set to None. For a concise representation, this is "MetadataRequest(owner=None)".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "MetadataRequest(owner=None)"
