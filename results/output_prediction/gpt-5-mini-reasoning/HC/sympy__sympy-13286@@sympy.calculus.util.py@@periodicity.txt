[THOUGHT]
We interpret the input f as the sympy expression csc(2*x) - sec(x) and take the symbol to be x.

1. periodicity() simplifies f (no effective change): f = csc(2*x) - sec(x).
2. f has x among its free symbols, so we continue.
3. f is an Add (sum/difference). The code obtains the part depending on x and calls the internal _periodicity on the addends.
4. Determine the period of each term:
   - For csc(2*x): csc is a trigonometric function with base period 2*pi; with argument 2*x the period is 2*pi divided by 2 = pi.
   - For sec(x): sec has the same full period as cos, i.e. 2*pi, so its period is 2*pi.
5. The period of the sum/difference is the least common multiple of the individual periods: lcm(pi, 2*pi) = 2*pi.
6. check=False, so the function returns the found period directly.

Thus the result is 2*pi.
