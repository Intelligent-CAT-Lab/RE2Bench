[THOUGHT]
1. The method checks the flags takes_self and takes_field on self. Both are False.
2. Therefore the first branch is taken: return f'{self._get_global_name(attr_name)}({value_var})'.
3. Call _get_global_name("a") -> "__attr_converter_a".
4. Format with value_var "a" -> "__attr_converter_a(a)".

{
    "output": "__attr_converter_a(a)"
