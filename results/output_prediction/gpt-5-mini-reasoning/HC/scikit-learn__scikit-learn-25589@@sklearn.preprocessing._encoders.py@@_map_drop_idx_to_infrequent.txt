[THOUGHT]
We call _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent with self._infrequent_enabled = False and drop_idx = "0".

The method starts with:
    if not self._infrequent_enabled:
        return drop_idx

Since _infrequent_enabled is False, it immediately returns the provided drop_idx unchanged. The provided drop_idx is the string "0", so the returned value is "0".
