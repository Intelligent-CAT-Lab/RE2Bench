[THOUGHT]
We call _mask_nc with eq = 2 - 2*cos(phi) (a SymPy expression) and name = None.

1. name becomes 'mask' (default).
2. The function sets up a generator for Dummy names and an inner Dummy factory, then sets expr = eq.
3. It checks if expr.is_commutative. The expression 2 - 2*cos(phi) is a standard commutative SymPy expression (Add/Mul/Function of a symbol are commutative), so expr.is_commutative is True.
4. Because expr.is_commutative is True, the function immediately returns (eq, {}, []).

So the output is the original expression, an empty dict for replacements, and an empty list for nc_syms.
