[THOUGHT]
1. __contains__ delegates to contains with the same arguments (prereleases not provided).
2. contains calls _coerce_version on the item. The item is a Version('1.0a1'), so version is not None and version.is_prerelease is True.
3. The installed argument is not provided/False, so we do not change prereleases.
4. contains calls self.filter([version], prereleases=None).
5. In filter, prereleases is None, and self.prereleases (property) returns True because self._prereleases is True. So prereleases becomes True.
6. self._specs is empty (frozenset()), so we go to the else branch. Since prereleases is True, filter returns an iterator over the input iterable (which yields the version).
7. contains returns bool(list(iterator)) -> list([version]) -> True.

Therefore the result of __contains__ is True.
