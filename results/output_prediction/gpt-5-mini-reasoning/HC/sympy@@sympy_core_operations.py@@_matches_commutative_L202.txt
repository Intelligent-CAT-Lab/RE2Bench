[THOUGHT]
We are matching the pattern sin(x*a_)**n_*cos(x*a_)**m_ against expr = sin(x).

- The pattern is a commutative product of two factors: sin(x*a_)**n_ and cos(x*a_)**m_. Both factors contain Wilds (a_, n_, m_) and none of those exact subexpressions appear in the target expr, so both go into the "wild_part".
- The matcher will try to match one wild factor to the real factor sin(x) and the other to the identity (1).
- Match sin(x*a_)**n_ to sin(x):
  - For the power pattern to match sin(x), the exponent n_ must match 1.
  - The base sin(x*a_) must match sin(x), so x*a_ must match x, giving a_ = 1.
  - So we get n_ = 1 and a_ = 1.
- Now match cos(x*a_)**m_ to the identity 1:
  - Power.matches has a special case: if the target is 1, it attempts to match the exponent to 0.
  - Thus m_ = 0 (the base need not match because cos(...)**0 equals 1).
- Final mapping: a_ -> 1, n_ -> 1, m_ -> 0.
