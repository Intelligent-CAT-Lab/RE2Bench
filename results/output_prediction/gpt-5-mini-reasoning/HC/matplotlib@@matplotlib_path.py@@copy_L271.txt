[THOUGHT]
We call Path.copy, which is implemented as "return copy.copy(self)". copy.copy performs a shallow copy of the object: it returns a new Path instance whose attribute values are the same references/values as the original. No attributes are modified by copy.copy.

Therefore the returned object's attributes will be the same as those provided on the input "self": the same _vertices, _codes, _interpolation_steps, _simplify_threshold, _should_simplify, and _readonly values.

I will present the copied object's attributes matching the input.
