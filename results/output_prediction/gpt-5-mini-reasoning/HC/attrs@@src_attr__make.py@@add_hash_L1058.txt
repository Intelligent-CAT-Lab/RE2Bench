Because the input "self" is provided as a JSON object with three fields and no further internal state is specified, the returned value is that same object (the _ClassBuilder instance). The JSON output will therefore mirror the input "self" object.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "<_ClassBuilder(cls=A)>"
}
```
