[THOUGHT]
1. Call dmp_sub with f = [], g = [], u = 0, K = "ZZ".
2. The function checks "if not u": since u == 0 this is True, so it returns _dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K)).
3. _dup(f) and _dup(g) simply return f and g unchanged, so this becomes _dmp(dup_sub([], [], "ZZ")).
4. dup_sub checks "if not f": here f == [] so that's True, and it returns dup_neg(g, K). Since g is [], dup_neg([] , K) should produce the negation of the zero polynomial, which is still [].
5. dup_sub therefore returns [], and _dmp returns its argument unchanged, so the final result is [].
