[THOUGHT]
1. transform is called with X = [[0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 6]].
2. fit_dataframe_and_transform_dataframe = False (no feature_names_in_ present), so _check_n_features ensures X has 2 features — OK.
3. Routing is disabled, so routed_params = self._get_empty_routing().
4. _call_func_on_transformers builds transformers from self._iter(fitted=True) -> one transformer: ("trans", "Trans()", [0,1]).
5. It calls _transform_one on that transformer with X subsetted to columns [0,1], which is the same matrix [[0,2],[1,4],[2,6]]. The placeholder transformer "Trans()" returns a 2D array with the same values (identity behavior assumed).
6. _validate_output accepts the 2D array.
7. _hstack receives a single 2D array in Xs and sparse_output_ is False. No container adapter applies, so it returns np.hstack(Xs) which for a single array is the same array.
8. Final output is the 3x2 array [[0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 6]].
