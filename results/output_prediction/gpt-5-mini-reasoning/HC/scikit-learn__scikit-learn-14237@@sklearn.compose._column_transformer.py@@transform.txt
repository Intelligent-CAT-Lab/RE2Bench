[THOUGHT]
We call ColumnTransformer.transform with self where "transformers_" is null (None) and X is null.

1. The first line of transform is check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_').
2. check_is_fitted checks that the estimator has been fitted by verifying the presence and truthiness of the fitted attribute 'transformers_'. Here transformers_ exists but is None (falsy).
3. Therefore check_is_fitted raises a NotFittedError with a message that includes the class name: "This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator."
4. Execution stops there and transform does not return normally.

So the result is the exception being raised (NotFittedError with that message).
