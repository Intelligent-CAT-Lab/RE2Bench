[THOUGHT]
1. The input backend is "Agg".
2. is_valid_backend first checks if backend starts with "module://". It does not, so it lowercases the backend -> "agg".
3. It checks the backwards_compat mapping; "agg" is not a key, so backend stays "agg".
4. It checks if "agg" is in _BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK. The built-in mapping contains "agg" (maps to "headless"), so this condition is True.
5. Therefore is_valid_backend returns True immediately (entry points are not loaded and no other state is modified).
