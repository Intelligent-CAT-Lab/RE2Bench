[THOUGHT]
We execute ColumnTransformer._hstack(self, Xs) with the provided inputs.

1. The method starts with "if self.sparse_output_:" — in the provided self, sparse_output_ is False, so we go to the else branch.

2. The first line in the else branch is:
   Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]

   This attempts to iterate over Xs. In the input, Xs is null (i.e., None). Iterating over None raises a TypeError in Python: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".

3. Therefore the method does not proceed further and raises that TypeError.

So the outcome is an exception: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.
