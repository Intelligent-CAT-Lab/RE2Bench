[THOUGHT]
We run _nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop with the given X and Y.

1. Initialize y_score as first column of Y:
   y_score = [-0.85511537, -0.70878547, 0.26065014, 1.3032507]^T

2. Iteration 1 (ite = 1):
   - Compute x_weights = (X^T y_score) / (y_score^T y_score).
     y_score^T y_score ≈ 3.0.
     X^T y_score ≈ [2.88319, 2.97782, 2.85708]^T
     => raw x_weights ≈ [0.96106, 0.99261, 0.95236]^T
     Normalize to unit norm => x_weights ≈ [0.5729, 0.5917, 0.5676]^T (shape (3,1))
   - x_score = X x_weights ≈ [-1.3529, -1.2422, 0.3677, 2.2268]^T
   - y_weights = (Y^T x_score) / (x_score^T x_score) ≈ [0.5947, 0.5935]^T
     Normalize y_weights (norm_y_weights=True) => y_weights ≈ [0.7076, 0.7066]^T
   - y_score = Y y_weights ≈ [-1.2258, -0.9602, 0.3250, 1.8611]^T

   The change in x_weights from x_weights_old (which was 0) is large, so continue.

3. Iteration 2 (ite = 2):
   - Compute x_weights with the updated y_score:
     x_weights raw ≈ [0.6809, 0.7024, 0.6710]^T
     Normalize => x_weights ≈ [0.5743, 0.5927, 0.5659]^T
   - x_score ≈ [-1.3548, -1.2410, 0.3679, 2.2276]^T
   - y_weights (before norm) ≈ [0.5949, 0.5934]^T
     Normalize => y_weights ≈ [0.70765, 0.70643]^T
   - y_score ≈ [-1.2257, -0.9602, 0.3248, 1.8609]^T

   The change in x_weights from previous iteration is small but still above tol (norm squared ~ 5.8e-6 > 1e-6), so iterate again.

4. Iteration 3 (ite = 3):
   - Recomputing with the just-updated y_score produces x_weights and y_weights essentially identical (differences now below tol).
   - The convergence condition dot(x_weights - x_weights_old, x_weights - x_weights_old) < tol is satisfied, so break.

5. Final returned values:
   - x_weights (shape (3,1)) ≈ [[0.5743], [0.5927], [0.5659]]
   - y_weights (shape (2,1)) ≈ [[0.70765], [0.70643]]
   - ite = 3

(Values are approximations from the described numeric steps; arrays are column vectors as produced by the function.)
