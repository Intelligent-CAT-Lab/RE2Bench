[THOUGHT]
- The method first checks if self.is_number. For self = -2 this is True.
- It calls n2 = self._eval_evalf(2). For a numeric literal this returns a Float representing -2 (with a precision > 1), so n2 is not None, not S.NaN, and getattr(n2, '_prec', 1) != 1.
- It computes f = self.evalf(2). f.is_Float is True, so match = (f, S.Zero).
- r = f is Float(-2), i = S.Zero. Both r and i are Numbers.
- The code then takes the branch where r._prec != 1 and i._prec != 1 (r has precision > 1; S.Zero is treated so that the branch proceeds). It returns bool(not i and (r > 0 if positive else r < 0)).
- not i is True (i is zero). positive is True, so it evaluates r > 0 which is False for -2. Therefore the whole expression is False.
- Thus the method returns False.
