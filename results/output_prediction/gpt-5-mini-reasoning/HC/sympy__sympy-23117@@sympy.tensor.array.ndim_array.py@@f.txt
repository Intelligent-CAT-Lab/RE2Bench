[THOUGHT]
1. The input pointer is the string: sin(x)**2 + "cos(x)"**2
2. Typical behavior is to call sympify on this string. sympify parses unquoted names like sin(x) as SymPy function calls, while quoted text "cos(x)" is parsed as a string literal, becoming a SymPy String('cos(x)').
3. Therefore the parsed expression becomes sin(x)**2 + String('cos(x)')**2.
4. When converted to its string form, the quoted part is shown with single quotes, so the result is: sin(x)**2 + 'cos(x)'**2
5. That string representation is returned as the output.
