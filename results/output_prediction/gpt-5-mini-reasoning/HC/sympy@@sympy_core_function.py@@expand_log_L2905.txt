[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with expr = "log(2)". Treat this as the SymPy expression log(2) (a Basic object), since expand_log expects a SymPy expression.
2. factor is False, so the function defines _handleMul and then calls expr.replace(query, _handleMul). The query checks x.is_Mul and other conditions; log(2) is not a Mul, so no matches occur and expr is unchanged.
3. The function then does sympify(expr). Since expr is already a SymPy Basic, sympify returns it unchanged.
4. Finally it calls .expand(..., log=True, ...) on log(2). There is nothing to expand, so the result remains log(2).

Therefore the function returns the SymPy expression log(2), represented as the string "log(2)".
