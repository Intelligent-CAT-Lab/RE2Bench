[THOUGHT]
We call Mul.as_ordered_factors on the product "w*z".

1. as_ordered_factors calls self.args_cnc().
2. args_cnc treats the Mul's args as a list of factors. For "w*z" the factors are [w, z].
   - Neither factor is non-commutative, so c = [w, z] and nc = [].
   - The number-related splitting logic doesn't apply (neither is a Number).
3. Back in as_ordered_factors, cpart = [w, z], ncpart = [].
4. cpart.sort(...) sorts by each expr.sort_key(order=None). For symbols this sorts lexicographically by name: 'w' before 'z', so the order remains [w, z].
5. The function returns cpart + ncpart -> [w, z].

Therefore the output is the ordered list of factors: ["w", "z"].
