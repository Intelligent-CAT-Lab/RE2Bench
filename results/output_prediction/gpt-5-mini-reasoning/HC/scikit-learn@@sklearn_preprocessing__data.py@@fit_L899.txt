[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate StandardScaler.fit given the inputs.

1. fit calls _reset(), which deletes any existing data-dependent attributes if present. The provided self has only the init attributes (with_mean=True, with_std=True, copy=True), so after _reset there are no scale_, mean_, var_, n_samples_seen_ attributes.

2. fit then calls partial_fit with X = [[1, nan], [0, 0]], sample_weight = None.

3. Inside partial_fit:
   - X is treated with numpy namespace and becomes a 2x2 float array:
       column0: [1.0, 0.0]
       column1: [nan, 0.0]
   - n_features = 2.
   - first_call is True (n_samples_seen_ not present), so n_samples_seen_ is initialized as an int64 zero array of length 2: [0, 0].
   - Because X is dense (not sparse), and because no previous state exists, the code sets initial mean_ = 0.0 and var_ = 0.0 (since with_std=True).
   - Then _incremental_mean_and_var is called to process the batch:
       - For column0: values [1,0] -> mean = (1+0)/2 = 0.5; variance (population, ddof=0) = ((1-0.5)^2 + (0-0.5)^2)/2 = 0.25. count = 2.
       - For column1: only one non-NaN value (0). mean = 0.0; variance = 0.0; count = 1.
     So after this call:
       mean_ = [0.5, 0.0]
       var_  = [0.25, 0.0]
       n_samples_seen_ = [2, 1] (int64)
   - Since max(n_samples_seen_) != min(...), n_samples_seen_ remains an array (not collapsed to scalar).
   - with_std is True, so compute scale_ = sqrt(var_) = [0.5, 0.0].
   - _is_constant_feature marks features with zero variance (or insufficient samples) as constant; column1 is constant. _handle_zeros_in_scale replaces zero scales for constant features with 1.0 to avoid division by zero. So final scale_ = [0.5, 1.0].

4. partial_fit returns self, and fit returns that same fitted estimator object.

Therefore the returned object includes the original init attributes and the fitted attributes:
- with_mean: true
- with_std: true
- copy: true
- mean_: [0.5, 0.0]
- var_: [0.25, 0.0]
- n_samples_seen_: [2, 1]
- scale_: [0.5, 1.0]
