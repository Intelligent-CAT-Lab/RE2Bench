[THOUGHT]
We call _EvaluatorPrinter._preprocess with args = [] and expr = "sin(x)**2".

1. dummify = self._dummify -> False.
2. Since not dummify, it sets dummify = any(isinstance(arg, Dummy) for arg in flatten(args)).
   - flatten([]) returns [].
   - any(...) over an empty iterator is False.
   - So dummify remains False.
3. argstrs is initialized to [].
4. The for-loop "for arg in args" does nothing because args is empty.
5. The function returns (argstrs, expr) which is ([], "sin(x)**2").

So the output is a 2-element tuple/list: an empty list and the unchanged expression string.
