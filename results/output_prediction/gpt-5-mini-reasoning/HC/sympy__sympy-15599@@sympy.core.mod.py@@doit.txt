[THOUGHT]
We call the inner function doit(p, q) with p = 2*t and q = t (SymPy expressions).

Step-by-step:
1. q is not zero, neither p nor q are infinite or NaN.
2. p is not 0, not equal to q (2*t != t), not equal to -q, and not an integer with q == 1.
3. q is not a Number (it's a symbol), so skip the q.is_Number branch.
4. Compute r = p / q = (2*t) / t -> simplifies to 2.
5. Try d = int(r): int(2) -> d = 2 (an integer).
6. Compute rv = p - d * q = 2*t - 2*t -> 0.
7. Check if (rv * q < 0) == True: rv * q = 0, so condition is False.
8. Return rv, which is 0 (SymPy's S.Zero).

So doit returns 0.
