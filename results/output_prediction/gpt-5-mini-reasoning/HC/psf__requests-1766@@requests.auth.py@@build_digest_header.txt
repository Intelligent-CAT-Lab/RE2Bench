[THOUGHT]
We run HTTPDigestAuth.build_digest_header with:
- username = "user"
- password = "pass"
- chal:
  - realm = "me@kennethreitz.com"
  - nonce = "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
  - qop = "auth"
  - opaque = "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"
  - algorithm = "MD5"
- method = "GET"
- url = "http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"

Step-by-step:

1. algorithm = 'MD5' -> _algorithm = 'MD5' -> hash_utf8 is MD5 hex of UTF-8 bytes.
2. KD = lambda s,d: hash_utf8('%s:%s' % (s, d))
3. p_parsed.path is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", no query, so uri = "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".
4. A1 = 'user:me@kennethreitz.com:pass'
   HA1 = MD5(A1)
5. A2 = 'GET:/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'
   HA2 = MD5(A2)
6. nonce is different from last_nonce (last_nonce is ""), so nonce_count becomes 1.
   ncvalue = '%08x' % 1 -> "00000001"
7. cnonce is computed from time.ctime(), os.urandom(8) and other runtime values, then sha1(...).hexdigest()[:16]. This value is nondeterministic here (depends on current time and random bytes).
8. noncebit is built as 'nonce:ncvalue:cnonce:qop:HA2' and respdig = KD(HA1, noncebit), i.e. MD5('%s:%s' % (HA1, noncebit)). Because cnonce is nondeterministic, the resulting response digest is also nondeterministic.
9. The header string is assembled as:
   Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="<response>", opaque="3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="<cnonce>"

Because cnonce and therefore response are generated from non-deterministic runtime data (time + os.urandom), we cannot compute their exact hex values here. I'll show the Authorization header with placeholders for those two runtime-dependent values.
