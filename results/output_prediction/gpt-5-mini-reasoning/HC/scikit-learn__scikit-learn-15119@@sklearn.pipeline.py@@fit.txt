[THOUGHT]
We call FeatureUnion.fit(self, X, y, **fit_params).

1. fit calls self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one).
2. _parallel_func begins by converting transformer_list to a list: self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list).
   - Given transformer_list is null (None), treating it as an empty sequence is the natural interpretation here: that there are no transformers to run.
3. After that, self._validate_transformers() and then transformers = list(self._iter()) produce an empty list of transformers because transformer_list is empty/None.
4. _parallel_func therefore yields an empty result (no fitted transformers).
5. Back in fit, transformers is falsy (empty), so fit returns self immediately without modifying attributes.

Therefore the returned object's attributes remain as given: transformer_list null, n_jobs null, transformer_weights null, verbose false.
