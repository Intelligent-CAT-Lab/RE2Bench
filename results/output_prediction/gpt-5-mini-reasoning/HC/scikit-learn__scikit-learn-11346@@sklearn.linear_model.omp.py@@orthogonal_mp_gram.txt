We run orthogonal_mp_gram with Gram (12x12), Xy (12x1), n_nonzero_coefs=1, tol=None.

- Xy is 2D with one column, so loop runs once (k=0).
- Call _gram_omp with max_features = n_nonzero_coefs = 1.
- In _gram_omp:
  - alpha is the 12-length vector Xy.
  - Pick atom lam = argmax |alpha| = index 1 (value 2.33249979).
  - n_active = 0 branch sets L[0,0] = sqrt(Gram[1,1]) = 1.0.
  - Swap rows/cols 0 and 1 of Gram and swap entries 0 and 1 of alpha and indices.
  - n_active increments to 1.
  - Solve for gamma: since L is 1x1 with value 1, gamma = Xy[:1] = [2.33249979].
  - Compute beta = Gram[:, :1] * gamma; after the swaps this equals the (swapped) Xy values, so alpha = Xy - beta becomes zero vector.
  - Since n_active == max_features (1), loop breaks and returns (gamma, indices[:1], n_active).
  - indices[:1] is [1] (the original selected index).
- Back in orthogonal_mp_gram, with return_path=False:
  - It assigns coef[idx, k] = x, so coef[1,0] = 2.33249979, all other entries remain 0.
- Squeeze returns a 1D array length 12 with a single nonzero entry at index 1 equal to 2.33249979.

Therefore the function returns the coefficient vector:
[0.0, 2.33249979, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
