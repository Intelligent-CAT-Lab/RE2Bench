[THOUGHT]
We treat "sqrt(2)" as the SymPy Pow expression 2**(1/2).

1. In Pow.as_content_primitive: call b, e = self.as_base_exp(). For sqrt(2), b = 2, e = 1/2.
2. Compute b = _keep_coeff(*b.as_content_primitive(...)). For integer 2, as_content_primitive returns (2, 1), and _keep_coeff(2, 1) returns 2. So b is the Rational/Integer 2.
3. Compute ce, pe = e.as_content_primitive(...). For e = 1/2, as_content_primitive returns (1/2, 1). So ce = 1/2, pe = 1.
4. Since b.is_Rational is true, take h, t = pe.as_coeff_Add(). For pe = 1, as_coeff_Add returns (1, 0), so h = 1, t = 0.
5. h.is_Rational and b != 0, so compute ceh = ce*h = 1/2. Set c = Pow(b, ceh) = 2**(1/2) (sqrt(2)). r = 0 initially; since c is not rational, do iceh, r = divmod(ceh.p, ceh.q). ceh = 1/2 => ceh.p = 1, ceh.q = 2 => iceh = 0, r = 1. Then c = Pow(b, iceh) = Pow(2,0) = 1.
6. Compute the second part: t + r/ce/ceh.q = 0 + 1/(1/2)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Then _keep_coeff(ce, that) = _keep_coeff(1/2, 1) = 1/2. Then self.func(b, ...) = Pow(2, 1/2) = sqrt(2).
7. Return (c, self.func(...)) which is (1, sqrt(2)).

Therefore the output tuple is (1, sqrt(2)). Represented in JSON as [1, "sqrt(2)"] for the second element.
