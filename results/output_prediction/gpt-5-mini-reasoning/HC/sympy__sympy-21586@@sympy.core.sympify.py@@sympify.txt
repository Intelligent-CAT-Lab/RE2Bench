[THOUGHT]
1. The input a is the Python string "2500/pi" and strict=True.
2. The function checks several early cases (is_sympy, CantSympify, converter mappings, numpy instances, _sympy_ attribute) — none apply for a plain str.
3. It skips the block guarded by "if not strict" because strict is True.
4. It reaches the block:
       if strict:
           raise SympifyError(a)
   Since strict is True and no earlier return happened, the function raises SympifyError with the original input string as the argument.
5. Therefore the function does not return a sympy expression; it raises SympifyError("2500/pi").
