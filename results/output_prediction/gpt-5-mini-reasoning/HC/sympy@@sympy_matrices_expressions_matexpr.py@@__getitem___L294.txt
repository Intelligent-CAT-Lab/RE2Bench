[THOUGHT]
We run MatrixExpr.__getitem__(self, key) with key = [1, 2].

Step-by-step through the method:

1. First check: if not isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(key, slice):
   - key is a list, so isinstance(key, slice) is False. This branch is skipped.

2. Second check: if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2:
   - key is a list, not a tuple. This branch is skipped.

3. Third check: elif isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer)):
   - key is a list, not an integer type. Skipped.

4. Fourth check: elif isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr)):
   - key is a list, not a Symbol/Expr. Skipped.

5. None of the branches matched, so the final line executes:
   raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)

Here self is the provided empty dict {}. Formatting %s with that yields the string "{}". So the raised exception is:
IndexError: Invalid index, wanted {}[i,j]

Therefore the function does not return a normal value but raises that IndexError.
