[THOUGHT]
We are asked to run a method named _eval_evalf with self={} (an empty object representation) and prec=57.

Looking through the provided code, _eval_evalf is implemented in multiple classes; the general convention in SymPy is that the default "no specific numeric-evaluation available" implementation of _eval_evalf returns None (and higher-level callers then fall back to returning the original object). Given the provided "self" is an empty object with no numeric-evaluation machinery (no _as_mpf_val, no args to traverse, etc.), the most reasonable result of calling a generic/default _eval_evalf is None.

Therefore the output is null in JSON (Python None).
