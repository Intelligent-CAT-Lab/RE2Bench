[THOUGHT]
1. prepare_url is called with url="http://localhost:49515/" and params={}.

2. url is a str, so it stays "http://localhost:49515/". lstrip() doesn't change it.

3. The check for ':' and not starting with 'http' is false because it does start with 'http', so parsing proceeds.

4. parse_url("http://localhost:49515/") yields scheme='http', auth=None, host='localhost', port=49515, path='/', query='' (empty), fragment='' (empty).

5. scheme and host are present. host is ASCII and doesn't start with '*' or '.'.

6. netloc built as 'localhost:49515'.

7. params is an empty dict. _encode_params({}) iterates no items and returns an empty string ''. Since enc_params is empty, no query modification occurs; query remains empty.

8. urlunparse(...) produces the URL "http://localhost:49515/". requote_uri returns the same string.

9. self.url is set to "http://localhost:49515/". The method does not return an explicit value, so it returns None.

Therefore the output (the return value) is null in JSON.
