[THOUGHT]
1. The method get_masked_triangles checks if self.mask is not None.
2. In the input, "mask" is null, which corresponds to Python None.
3. Therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns self.triangles unchanged.
4. So the output is the same triangles array string provided in the input.
