[THOUGHT]
We call TRmorrie with rv = cos(phi).

1. TRmorrie returns bottom_up(rv, f).
2. bottom_up sees rv has args (phi), so it recursively calls bottom_up on phi.
3. phi has no args (an atom), so bottom_up(phi, f) returns phi unchanged.
4. Returning to cos(phi), the reconstructed args equal the original args, so rv remains cos(phi). bottom_up then calls F(rv) which is f(rv).
5. f checks if rv.is_Mul. cos(phi).is_Mul is False, so f immediately returns rv unchanged.
6. Therefore bottom_up returns cos(phi), and TRmorrie returns cos(phi).

Final result: cos(phi)
