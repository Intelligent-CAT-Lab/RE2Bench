[THOUGHT]
We start with expr = sinh(x) + cosh(x) (as a SymPy expression).

1. exptrigsimp does a bottom_up traversal applying exp_trig to subexpressions. For the subexpressions sinh(x) and cosh(x), exp_trig considers rewrites to exp and to trig, but the traversal leaves them as HyperbolicFunction nodes (no change that affects the final identity).

2. After that, exptrigsimp checks if the expression has HyperbolicFunction (it does). It calls hyper_as_trig and then applies TR2i transformations; the combination of these rewrite utilities converts the hyperbolic sum to an exponential form.

3. Using the identity cosh(x) + sinh(x) = exp(x), the expression simplifies to exp(x).

4. The resulting SymPy expression exp(x) has a single argument x; thus the nargs._elements list contains one element: "x".

Therefore the output represents the single argument "x".
