[THOUGHT]
We call OneHotEncoder.transform with X = None.

1. transform starts with check_is_fitted(self). The estimator has attributes like n_features_in_ = 2, so it passes fitted check.

2. transform then calls self._transform(X, ...). Inside _transform the first calls are:
   - self._check_feature_names(X, reset=False): this inspects X for feature names; X is None so _get_feature_names returns None and this check returns without error.
   - self._check_n_features(X, reset=False): this calls _num_features(X).

3. _num_features receives X = None. It builds a message "Unable to find the number of features from X of type NoneType" and then, because X has neither __len__ nor shape nor __array__, it raises a TypeError with that message.

4. _check_n_features catches that TypeError as e. Since reset=False and the estimator has n_features_in_ (value 2), _check_n_features raises a ValueError from that TypeError with the message:
   "X does not contain any features, but OneHotEncoder is expecting 2 features as input."

Therefore transform raises a ValueError with that exact message.
