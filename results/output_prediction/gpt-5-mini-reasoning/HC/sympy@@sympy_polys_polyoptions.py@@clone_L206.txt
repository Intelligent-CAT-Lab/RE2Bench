[THOUGHT]
1. clone is called with self = {} (an empty dict) and updates = {"gens": ["cos(phi)"]}.
2. obj = dict.__new__(self.__class__) => dict.__new__(dict) produces a new empty dict obj = {}.
3. The loop "for option, value in self.items()" does nothing because self is empty.
4. The loop "for option, value in updates.items()" sets obj["gens"] = ["cos(phi)"].
5. The function returns obj which is {"gens": ["cos(phi)"]}. There is no "fraction" key, so that corresponds to null in the output structure.

```
{
    "fraction": null,
    "gens": [
        "cos(phi)"
    ]
