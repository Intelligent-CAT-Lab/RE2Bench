[THOUGHT]
We need to match the pattern sin(x*a_)**n_*cos(x*a_)**m_ against expr = cos(x).

- The pattern is a Mul of two power factors: sin(x*a_)**n_ and cos(x*a_)**m_, with Wild symbols a_, n_, m_.
- To match cos(x), one factor of the pattern must account for the cos(x) and the other factor must reduce to 1.
- Let cos(x*a_)**m_ match cos(x). That requires the base cos(x*a_) to equal cos(x), so x*a_ must be x ⇒ a_ = 1. Then the exponent m_ must be 1 so cos(x*a_)**m_ = cos(x).
- The remaining factor sin(x*a_)**n_ should become 1; with a_ = 1 this is sin(x)**n_. For sin(x)**n_ to equal 1, take n_ = 0 (sin(x)**0 = 1). (n_ = 0 is a valid wildcard match.)
- These assignments are consistent: a_ = 1, m_ = 1, n_ = 0.

Thus the match gives a_ -> 1, m_ -> 1, n_ -> 0.
