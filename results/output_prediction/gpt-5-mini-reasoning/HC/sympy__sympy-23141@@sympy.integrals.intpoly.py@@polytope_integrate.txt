[THOUGHT]
The function begins by checking if clockwise is True. It is True in the input, so it enters the block:
    if clockwise:
        if isinstance(poly, Polygon):
            ...
        else:
            raise TypeError('clockwise=True works for only 2-PolytopeV-representation input')

The provided poly argument is an empty dict ({}), not a Polygon instance, so the function raises a TypeError with the exact message:
    "clockwise=True works for only 2-PolytopeV-representation input"
Therefore the call results in that TypeError being raised.
