[THOUGHT]
1. __eq__ starts by checking if type(self) != type(b).
2. In the input, self is a Kernel-like object (has attributes length_scale, length_scale_bounds) while b is a Python string "RBF(length_scale=1)". Their types differ.
3. Because the types differ, __eq__ returns False immediately (it does not call get_params or compare attributes).
