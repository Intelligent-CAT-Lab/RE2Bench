[THOUGHT]
We simulate sympy.multipledispatch.dispatcher.add with the given inputs.

1. The provided "signature" is a Python list containing a single class object: [<class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>].

2. The method first checks "if not signature": it's non-empty, so skip.

3. It checks "if any(isinstance(typ, tuple) for typ in signature)": the single element is a class, not a tuple, so this is False and that branch is skipped.

4. It then iterates "for typ in signature:" and checks "if not isinstance(typ, type)": the element is a class, so isinstance(..., type) is True, so no TypeError is raised there.

5. Next the code does "self.funcs[signature] = func". Python dict keys must be hashable. A list is unhashable, so attempting to use the list "signature" as a dict key raises a TypeError from the interpreter: "unhashable type: 'list'".

6. The method does not catch this exception, so the function call results in that TypeError being raised.

Therefore the output is the TypeError indicating an unhashable list was used as a dict key.
