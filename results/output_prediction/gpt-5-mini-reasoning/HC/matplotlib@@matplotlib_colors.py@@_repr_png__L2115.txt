[THOUGHT]
1. _repr_png_ is called. It checks self._isinit which is false, so it calls self._init().
2. The provided _init implementation begins with: s = self.patch.shape
3. In the input, self["patch"] is a Python list (nested lists), not a numpy array. Python lists do not have a .shape attribute.
4. Therefore evaluating self.patch.shape raises an AttributeError: "'list' object has no attribute 'shape'".
5. As a result, _repr_png_ does not complete and no PNG bytes are produced; the call raises that AttributeError.
