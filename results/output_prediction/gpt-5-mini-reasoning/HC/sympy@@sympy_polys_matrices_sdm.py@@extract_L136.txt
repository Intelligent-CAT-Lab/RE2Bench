[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate SDM.extract(self, rows, cols) with:
- self: an SDM of shape (3,3) with no stored (nonzero) entries (i.e. the underlying dict is empty), domain "ZZ"
- rows = [0,1,2]
- cols = [0]

Step-by-step:
1. The method first tests `if not (self and rows and cols):`. `rows` and `cols` are non-empty lists (truthy). `self` is an SDM instance whose underlying dict has no stored entries, so bool(self) is False. Therefore the whole condition is True and the method returns `self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)`.

2. `len(rows) = 3`, `len(cols) = 1`, so `self.zeros((3,1), "ZZ")` is called. `zeros` returns `cls({}, shape, domain)`, i.e. a new SDM with an empty internal dict and shape (3,1). That represents a 3x1 zero matrix (no stored non-zero entries).

3. In the requested structured output we represent the 3 rows × 1 column matrix elements; each element is zero (integer 0 in domain ZZ).

Therefore each of the three row entries at column 0 is 0.
