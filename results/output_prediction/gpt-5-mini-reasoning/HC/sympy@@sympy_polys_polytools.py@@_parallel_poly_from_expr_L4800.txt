[THOUGHT]
We run _parallel_poly_from_expr(exprs, opt) with exprs = ["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"] and opt = {}.

1. len(exprs) == 2, but the two items are strings, not Poly instances, so the special-case early return is skipped.

2. origs becomes the list ["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"], and exprs is reset to [].

3. Loop over origs:
   - For i=0, expr = sympify("2") -> Integer(2). It's a SymPy Basic and not a Poly, so index 0 is appended to _exprs. If opt.expand is truthy it would call .expand(), but opt is an empty/options-like object; regardless expanding Integer(2) does nothing.
   - For i=1, expr = sympify("-1*2*cos(phi)") -> -2*cos(phi). It's Basic and not Poly, so index 1 appended to _exprs. Expanding would yield -2*cos(phi) still.

   After the loop, exprs holds the sympified expressions: [2, -2*cos(phi)].

4. Since failed is False and there were no Poly instances to convert back to expression form, the code calls reps, opt = _parallel_dict_from_expr(exprs, opt).

   The invoked helper is expected to produce a list of "rep" dictionaries (one per expression) and to set opt.gens to the chosen polynomial generators. For the given expressions, there is no clear polynomial generator list that would make both expressions polynomial (cos(phi) is not a polynomial in phi). If _parallel_dict_from_expr returns without setting opt.gens (i.e., opt.gens is empty/falsey), the next line in _parallel_poly_from_expr will raise PolificationFailed.

5. The code checks "if not opt.gens: raise PolificationFailed(opt, origs, exprs, True)". Given the input opt is empty and there is no reason a non-empty gens list would be produced for these expressions (cos(phi) prevents a sensible polynomial generator set), the function will raise PolificationFailed with the given opt, origs and sympified exprs.

Therefore the function does not return a normal value; it raises PolificationFailed(opt, origs, exprs, True). I represent that exception as a string in the output JSON.
