[THOUGHT]
We simulate dmp_zz_wang_hensel_lifting step by step with given inputs.

1. Initial values:
   - f = [[1], [], [-1, 0, 0]]
   - H = [[1, -1], [1, 1]]
   - LC = [[1], [1]]
   - A = [-1]
   - p = 37
   - u = 1
   - K is the integer domain (represented as "ZZ" in the input)

2. Entry: S, n, v = ([f], len(A), u - 1)
   - S = [f]
   - n = 1
   - v = 0

3. The initial loop "for i, a in enumerate(reversed(A[1:]))" sees A[1:] empty, so it's skipped. S remains [f].

4. Compute d = max(dmp_degree_list(f, u)[1:]):
   - For u=1 the degree list has two entries; the degree in the inner variable (index 1) is 2 (coming from the inner list [-1,0,0]).
   - So d = 2.

5. The main loop "for j, s, a in zip(range(2, n + 2), S, A)" runs once with:
   - j = 2, s = f, a = -1
   - G = list(H) (copy of H), w = j - 1 = 1
   - I = A[:j-2] = A[:0] = []
   - J = A[j-1:] = A[1:] = []

6. For each pair (h, lc) from zip(H, LC):
   - lc is reduced via dmp_eval_tail(..., J, v, K) with J empty (no change) and then dmp_ground_trunc(..., p, w-1, K) with w-1 = 0 (reduces constants mod p). LC entries are 1 so remain 1.
   - H entries are adjusted by prepending the (reduced) lc and raising remaining part; with the given values this leaves H unchanged:
     - H[0] remains [1, -1]
     - H[1] remains [1, 1]

7. m = dmp_nest([K.one, -a], w, K) with a = -1 gives m = [[1, 1]] and M = dmp_one(w, K) = [[1]].

8. c = dmp_sub(s, dmp_expand(H, w, K), w, K):
   - dmp_expand(H, w, K) multiplies the two factors [1, -1] and [1, 1] producing [1, 0, -1], i.e. the polynomial 1 - x^2.
   - The original s = f also represents 1 - x^2 (constant term 1, middle 0, quadratic -1), so c = s - expanded(H) is the zero polynomial.

9. dj = dmp_degree_in(s, w, w) is 2. The loop for k in range(0, dj) checks if c is zero via dmp_zero_p(c, w). Since c is zero, it breaks immediately and no correction steps are performed.

10. After finishing the j-loop, the function checks if dmp_expand(H, u, K) != f. They are equal, so no ExtraneousFactors is raised.

11. The function returns H unchanged: [[1, -1], [1, 1]].

Therefore the output is H as given.
