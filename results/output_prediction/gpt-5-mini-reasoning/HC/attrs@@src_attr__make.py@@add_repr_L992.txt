[THOUGHT]
1. add_repr is called with ns = None.
2. It calls _make_repr_script(self._attrs, None) which returns a tuple (script, globs). The exact contents of script and globs are produced based on self._attrs, but we don't need their precise values to determine the return.
3. It defines the inner function _attach_repr(cls_dict, globs) which, when later executed, will set cls_dict['__repr__'] = self._add_method_dunders(globs['__repr__']).
4. It appends the tuple (script, globs, _attach_repr) to self._script_snippets.
5. It sets self._repr_added = True.
6. It returns self.

Therefore the function returns the same _ClassBuilder instance passed in: "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "<_ClassBuilder(cls=Concrete)>"
}
