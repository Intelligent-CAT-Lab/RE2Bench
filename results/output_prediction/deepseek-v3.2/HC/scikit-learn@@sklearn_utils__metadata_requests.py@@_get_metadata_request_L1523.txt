[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `_get_metadata_request` is called with `self` containing:
   - `registry`: some complex nested structure
   - `_metadata_request`: a string representation of a dictionary containing metadata requests for 'fit', 'transform', and 'inverse_transform' methods

2. The function first checks if `self` has `_metadata_request` attribute: `if hasattr(self, '_metadata_request')` returns True.

3. Since `self` has `_metadata_request`, it calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)`.

4. Looking at the `get_routing_for_object` function:
   - The input is a string: `"{'fit': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'transform': {'sample_weight': True, 'metadata': True}, 'inverse_transform': {'sample_weight': None, 'metadata': None}}"`
   - The function checks if this string has `get_metadata_routing` method: No
   - It checks if the object has `_type` attribute with value "metadata_request" or "metadata_router": No (it's a string)
   - Therefore, it falls back to returning `MetadataRequest(owner=None)`

5. So `get_routing_for_object` returns a new `MetadataRequest` instance with owner=None.

6. The function returns this `MetadataRequest` instance.

7. The STRUCTURE expects a string representation in the "output" field, so I need to determine what this would look like. Based on the `__init__` function of MetadataRequest, it initializes with owner=None and sets up MethodMetadataRequest instances for all SIMPLE_METHODS.

8. However, since the constructor shows it creates MethodMetadataRequest instances for each method in SIMPLE_METHODS, the returned object would be a MetadataRequest containing empty MethodMetadataRequest objects for all simple methods.

9. The STRUCTURE placeholder XXX suggests we need to provide a string representation of the output. Given that get_routing_for_object returns `MetadataRequest(owner=None)`, and looking at the MetadataRequest constructor, this would create an object with method attributes for all SIMPLE_METHODS, each being an empty MethodMetadataRequest.

Based on this analysis, the output should be a MetadataRequest object with owner=None.
