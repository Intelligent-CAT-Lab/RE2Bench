[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The function `build_class` is called on a `_ClassBuilder` instance. Looking at the input, the `self` object has:
   - `auto_attribs`: false
   - `these`: null
   - `has_custom_setattr`: false

2. Looking at the `build_class` method in the provided code:
   ```python
   def build_class(self):
       self._eval_snippets()
       if self._slots is True:
           cls = self._create_slots_class()
           self._cls.__attrs_base_of_slotted__ = weakref.ref(cls)
       else:
           cls = self._patch_original_class()
           if PY_3_10_PLUS:
               cls = abc.update_abstractmethods(cls)
       if getattr(cls, '__attrs_init_subclass__', None) and '__attrs_init_subclass__' not in cls.__dict__:
           cls.__attrs_init_subclass__()
       return cls
   ```

3. I need to determine the value of `self._slots`. This comes from `props.is_slotted` in the constructor. Since the input doesn't provide information about `props`, I need to make reasonable assumptions based on typical usage.

4. The typical default behavior for attrs classes is:
   - If not explicitly specified, classes are usually non-slotted by default
   - The input shows minimal configuration (`auto_attribs: false`, `these: null`), suggesting a basic setup

5. Given that `self._slots` is likely `False` for this minimal configuration, the code will take the `else` branch and call `self._patch_original_class()`

6. Looking at `_patch_original_class()`:
   - It modifies the original class in place
   - It returns the modified class `cls`

7. Since `self._cls` is the original class passed to the constructor, and we're patching it in place, `build_class()` should return the modified original class.

8. Without knowing the specific class being processed, the output would be the class object itself that was passed to the `_ClassBuilder` constructor.

Based on typical attrs behavior and the code flow, `build_class()` returns the processed class object.
