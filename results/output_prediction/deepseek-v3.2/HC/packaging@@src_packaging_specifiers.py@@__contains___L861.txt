Let's simulate the `__contains__` method step-by-step.  

First, `__contains__` is called with `item = "<Version('1.0a1')>"` (this looks like a string representation of a `Version` object, but in real code it's probably an actual `Version` instance).  
In the provided code, `__contains__(self, item)` simply calls `self.contains(item)`.  

So we go to `contains` method:  
1. `version = _coerce_version(item)` — since `item` is already a `Version` instance in the given input (denoted by angle brackets `<Version('1.0a1')>` in the JSON), `_coerce_version` likely returns the same `Version` object.  
2. `installed` is `None` (not provided in kwargs), so `if installed and version.is_prerelease` is `False`.  
3. `prereleases` is `None` (not passed explicitly).  
4. Then it calls `self.filter([version], prereleases=prereleases)` with `prereleases = None`.  

Now `self` has:  
- `_specs = frozenset()` (empty set)  
- `_prereleases = True`  

Inside `filter`:  
- Since `prereleases` is `None` and `self.prereleases` is `True`, we set `prereleases = True`.  
- `self._specs` is empty, so go into the `else` branch.  
- In the else branch: if `prereleases is True`, `return iter(iterable)`.  

So `filter` returns an iterator over `[version]` (list with one element).  

Then `list(self.filter(...))` has length 1, so `bool(list(...))` is `True`.  

Thus `contains` returns `True`.  

Final output:  

[THOUGHT]  
1. `__contains__` calls `self.contains(item)`.  
2. `item` is a Version instance for "1.0a1".  
3. Inside `contains`, `version` is that Version instance.  
4. `installed` is None, `prereleases` is None, but `self.prereleases` property returns True (since `_prereleases` is True).  
5. `filter([version], prereleases=None)` will see `prereleases` becomes True because `self.prereleases` is True.  
6. Since `_specs` is empty, `filter` returns iterator over the input list because prereleases=True.  
7. Non-empty list → bool(list(...)) is True.  
8. So `__contains__` returns True.
