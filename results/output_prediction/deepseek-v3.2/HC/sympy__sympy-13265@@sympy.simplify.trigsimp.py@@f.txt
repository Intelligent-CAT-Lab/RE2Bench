Let me carefully trace through the code.

The function `exptrigsimp` is defined to simplify expressions involving exponentials and trigonometric functions. The input is an expression string: `"y*(-1 + exp(2 + 2*I))/(1 + exp(2 + 2*I))"`.

The function applies several transformations:

1. First, it uses `bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)` where `exp_trig` tries different representations (original, exponential form, cosine form) and picks the one with lowest operation count.

2. Then it applies another `bottom_up` with function `f` that looks for patterns to convert exponential forms to hyperbolic functions.

Given the input expression: `y*(-1 + exp(2 + 2*I))/(1 + exp(2 + 2*I))`, this looks similar to the hyperbolic tangent identity:
`tanh(z) = (e^z - e^{-z})/(e^z + e^{-z})` but here we have `(-1 + e^(2+2i))/(1 + e^(2+2i))`.

Actually, this can be rewritten as `-(1 - e^(2+2i))/(1 + e^(2+2i))` which is `-tanh((2+2i)/2) = -tanh(1+i)`.

So the simplified form should be `-y*tanh(1 + I)`.

Let me confirm this matches the code's transformation logic. The function `f` looks for specific exponential patterns and converts them to hyperbolic functions. The pattern matching in `f` should recognize this as a hyperbolic tangent form.
