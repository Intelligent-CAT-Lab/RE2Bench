[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate step by step:

1. The input is for `_print_Pow` method of `StrPrinter`. The `expr` argument is given as the string `"sqrt(2)"`. But actually, looking at the Python context, the `expr` should be a SymPy expression object (like `Pow(2, S.Half)`). However, in the input JSON, it's represented as a string `"sqrt(2)"`. This might be a simplification for the example – probably the actual object is a `Pow` with base 2 and exp 1/2.

2. In `_print_Pow`, we first check:
   - `expr.exp is S.Half` → Yes, if `expr` is `2**(1/2)`.
   - `rational=False` (given).
   → So we take the first branch: `return 'sqrt(%s)' % self._print(expr.base)`.

3. `self._print(expr.base)` would print the base `2`. Since it's a number, likely `_print_Integer` returns `"2"`.

4. So the result is `"sqrt(2)"`.

5. Wait, but the input `expr` is already `"sqrt(2)"`? That seems confusing. Maybe the input is meant to be a `Pow` object, and the string `"sqrt(2)"` is just how it's displayed in the JSON for readability.

6. Let's assume `expr` is `Pow(2, S.Half)`. Then the output should be `"sqrt(2)"`.

7. So the placeholder XXX should be filled with `"sqrt(2)"`.
