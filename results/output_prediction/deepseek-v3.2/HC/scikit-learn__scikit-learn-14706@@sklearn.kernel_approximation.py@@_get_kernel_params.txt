[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of `_get_kernel_params` step by step:

1. The function starts by initializing `params` with the value of `self.kernel_params`. Since `self.kernel_params` is `null` (None), `params` becomes an empty dictionary `{}`.

2. Next, it checks if the kernel is callable or if it's 'precomputed'. The kernel is 'polynomial', which is neither callable nor 'precomputed', so we enter the `if` block.

3. It iterates over the parameters in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`. Since the kernel is 'polynomial', we need to know what parameters are associated with the polynomial kernel. From the imports, `KERNEL_PARAMS` is imported from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`. For a polynomial kernel, the typical parameters are 'gamma', 'coef0', and 'degree'.

4. For each parameter in this list, it checks if `getattr(self, param)` is not None. If it is not None, it adds the parameter to the `params` dictionary.

5. Let's check each parameter:
   - For 'gamma': `self.gamma` is `null` (None), so it won't be added.
   - For 'coef0': `self.coef0` is `0.1` (not None), so `params['coef0'] = 0.1`.
   - For 'degree': `self.degree` is `3.1` (not None), so `params['degree'] = 3.1`.

6. The function then returns the `params` dictionary.

Since the structure expects `{"coef0": XXX, "degree": XXX}`, the output should contain these two parameters with their respective values.
