[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. We're calling `__call__` method of `_MultimetricScorer` with the given input:
   - `self._scorers` = `{"score": "EmpiricalCovariance.score"}`
   - `self._raise_exc` = `False`
   - `estimator` = `"EmpiricalCovariance()"` (string representation)
   - `args` = `["[[ 0.88895051, -0.94884286, -0.77838201, -0.99349011, -0.74907652]]"]`

2. Inside `__call__`, first check: `if _routing_enabled():`. Looking at the provided code, `_routing_enabled()` returns True only if metadata routing is configured. Since no specific configuration is mentioned, and the example doesn't show routing being enabled, we should check the actual behavior from the provided context. The code shows: if routing is not enabled, it creates a `common_kwargs` from kwargs (excluding sample_weight). Here `kwargs` is empty, so `common_kwargs` is empty.

3. `routed_params` will be created as:
   ```
   Bunch(**{name: Bunch(score=common_kwargs.copy()) for name in self._scorers})
   ```
   Which becomes: `{"score": Bunch(score={})}`

4. Since there's no `sample_weight` in kwargs, we skip that section.

5. The loop iterates over scorers. The only scorer is `"score": "EmpiricalCovariance.score"`. Note that this is a string, not a scorer object.

6. In the try block, we check `if isinstance(scorer, _BaseScorer)`. Since `"EmpiricalCovariance.score"` is a string, not a `_BaseScorer` instance, we go to the else branch: `score = scorer(estimator, *args, **routed_params.get(name).score)`. This means we're trying to call the string as a function.

7. Here's the issue: `scorer` is the string `"EmpiricalCovariance.score"`, not a callable. When we try to execute `"EmpiricalCovariance.score"(estimator, *args, ...)`, it will raise a TypeError because a string is not callable.

8. Since `self._raise_exc` is `False`, the exception will be caught and `scores[name] = format_exc()` will store the formatted exception traceback as a string.

9. Therefore, `scores["score"]` will contain a string with the traceback of the TypeError.

10. The output should be a JSON with `"score"` containing the formatted exception traceback string.
