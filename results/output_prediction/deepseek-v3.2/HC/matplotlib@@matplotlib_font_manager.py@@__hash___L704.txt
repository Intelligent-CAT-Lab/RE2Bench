1. The `__hash__` method is called on a FontProperties instance with the given attributes.
2. The method creates a tuple `l` containing:
   - `tuple(self.get_family())` → `tuple(["sans-serif"])` → `("sans-serif",)`
   - `self.get_slant()` → same as `get_style()` which returns `_slant` → `"normal"`
   - `self.get_variant()` → `"normal"`
   - `self.get_weight()` → `"normal"`
   - `self.get_stretch()` → `"normal"`
   - `self.get_size()` → `12.0`
   - `self.get_file()` → `None`
   - `self.get_math_fontfamily()` → `"cm"`
3. The tuple `l` is: `(("sans-serif",), "normal", "normal", "normal", "normal", 12.0, None, "cm")`
4. The hash of this tuple is computed. Since hashes are deterministic for the same input in a Python session, we can compute what this would be.

Let me compute the hash step by step:
- The tuple contains: a tuple with one string, four strings, a float, None, and a string
- In Python, hash values for tuples are computed based on the hash of their elements
- The hash of `("sans-serif",)` is some integer
- The hash of `"normal"` is consistent
- The hash of `12.0` is the same as hash of `12`
- The hash of `None` is consistent

Based on typical Python behavior, the hash of this specific configuration would be a consistent integer value.
