We need to simulate the execution of `resolve_backend` given the input.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. `backend` argument is `"agg"`, which is a string and doesn't start with `"module://"`.
2. `backend` is converted to lowercase in `resolve_backend`: `backend = backend.lower()` (already lowercase).
3. Check for `backend` in `self._BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK`:
   - `"agg"` is in `self._BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` (it maps to `"headless"`).
4. Therefore, `gui` is assigned `"headless"` (not `None`).
5. The condition `if gui == 'unknown'` is False.
6. The final return line is: `return (backend, gui if gui != 'headless' else None)`
   - Since `gui == 'headless'`, the second element becomes `None`.
7. Output is a tuple: `("agg", None)`.

Thus, `XXX` should be replaced with `["agg", null]` (JSON representation of tuple).

```
{
    "output": ["agg", null]
}
