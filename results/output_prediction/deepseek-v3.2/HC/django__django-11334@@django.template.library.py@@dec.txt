Let's step through the execution.

1. The input shows `dec` is being called with `func` argument provided, and `self` is an empty dict (likely representing a `Library` instance).  
   In the `Library` class, the `dec` function is defined only within `simple_tag` and `inclusion_tag`.  
   However, the problem does not explicitly tell us which method we are in — but since the input is `func` with `args` and `kwargs`, this suggests we are in a `simple_tag` decorator call where `func` is provided directly, not through a name argument.

2. Looking at `Library.simple_tag`:

   - If `func` is not None and callable, it returns `dec(func)`.
   - That means `dec` is called with `func` as argument.

   Inside `dec(func)`:

   - It gets the function name: `function_name = name or getattr(func, '_decorated_function', func).__name__`
   - Since `name` is None in this scenario (`name` wasn't passed in `args` or `kwargs` in the input), we use `func.__name__` or `func._decorated_function.__name__`.  
     From the input, `func.__name__` is `"func"`.

   - Then `compile_func` is defined inside `dec`, but `dec` returns `func` unchanged after registering the tag.

3. Therefore, `dec` returns `func` itself, unmodified in its identity (same object).  
   The structure to output matches the `func` input's attributes except placeholders for some fields, but since `func` is returned unchanged, its `__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, etc., should all be the same as in input.

From input JSON:  

```
"func": {
    "__module__": "template_tests.test_library",
    "__name__": "func",
    "__qualname__": "SimpleTagRegistrationTests.test_simple_tag_wrapped.\"<locals>\".func",
    "__doc__": null,
    "__annotations__": {},
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
```

So the output is exactly that.

[THOUGHT]
We are inside `Library.simple_tag` with `func` provided and `name=None`. The `dec` function is called with `func` as argument, registers a tag in `self.tags` with key `func.__name__` and a compiled node constructor, then returns the original `func` unchanged. So `dec` output is the original `func` object with its attributes unchanged.

```

    "__module__": "template_tests.test_library",
    "__name__": "func",
    "__qualname__": "SimpleTagRegistrationTests.test_simple_tag_wrapped.\"<locals>\".func",
    "__doc__": null,
    "__annotations__": {},
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
