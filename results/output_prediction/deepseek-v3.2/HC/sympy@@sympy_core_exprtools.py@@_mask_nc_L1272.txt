[THOUGHT]
1. The input `eq` is the string "2 - 2*cos(phi)". First, I need to sympify this expression.
   - The expression is commutative since it only involves numbers and the commutative function cos.
   - `2 - 2*cos(phi)` is a commutative expression.

2. Inside `_mask_nc`, after sympifying, we check if `expr.is_commutative`:
   - Since the expression is commutative, the function returns early with:
     `return (eq, {}, [])`
   - So the output should be the original expression, an empty dictionary, and an empty list.

3. Therefore, the output structure should be:
   ```
   {
       "output": ("2 - 2*cos(phi)", {}, [])
   }
   ```
