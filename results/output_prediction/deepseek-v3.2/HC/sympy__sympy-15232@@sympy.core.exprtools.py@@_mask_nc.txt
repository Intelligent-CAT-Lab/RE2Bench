[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The function `_mask_nc` takes an expression `eq` and an optional `name` parameter (default 'mask').
2. It creates a generator `numbered_names()` that yields 'mask0', 'mask1', etc.
3. It defines a local `Dummy` function that creates non-commutative Dummy symbols using those names.
4. The input expression is `eq = sin("Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)")) + 1`, but this needs to be parsed as a SymPy expression.
5. Since the input is a string, it needs to be converted to a SymPy expression first. The function doesn't show this conversion, but in context, `eq` should already be a SymPy expression.
6. The expression `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1` is commutative because:
   - `sin` is a commutative function
   - `Sum` is commutative
   - `1` is commutative
   - All parts are commutative
7. The function checks if `expr.is_commutative` is True, and if so, returns `(eq, {}, [])`
8. Since the entire expression is commutative, it should return the original expression, an empty dict, and an empty list.

Therefore, the output should be the original expression, an empty dictionary, and an empty list.
