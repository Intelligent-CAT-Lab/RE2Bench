Let's break it down step by step.  

The method `get_masked_triangles()` does:

1. If `self.mask` is not `None`, return `self.triangles[~self.mask]`.  
2. Otherwise, return `self.triangles`.

Given the input:  
- `mask` is `null`, which means `self.mask` is `None`.  
- Therefore, `get_masked_triangles()` will return `self.triangles` unchanged.

We only need to output `self.triangles` in the given format.

But first, I should check that `self.triangles` is correctly interpreted from the JSON string.

The JSON gives:  
`"triangles": "[[ 0,  1,  5], [ 8, 13, 12], ... ]"`  
This is a string representation of a Python list-of-lists.

Since the code for the `Triangulation` class does not show any modifications after `__init__` in this call, and `mask` is `None`, `get_masked_triangles()` returns exactly `self.triangles`.

Thus, the output will be the same as `self.triangles`.

[THOUGHT]
1. In `get_masked_triangles`, `self.mask` is `None`, so the `else` branch runs.
2. It returns `self.triangles`.
3. In the input, `self.triangles` is provided as a string, but in actual execution it would be a NumPy array after `__init__`. However, in this given input, it's already in the `self` dictionary as that string.
4. Since the output structure expects `XXX` to be filled, I should output `self.triangles` as a list-of-lists exactly as given (since in the real method it would be an array, but likely printed as list-like). For consistency with the input format, we should write it as a Python list.

But note: In `__init__`, `triangles` is converted to `np.array` with `dtype=np.int32`. So `self.triangles` is a numpy array. When it is returned, in a JSON output context, it would be serialized as a list-of-lists.  

Given that the input's `triangles` string is already in list-of-lists form, the output is simply that same structure.

Final answer:
