Let’s simulate the execution step by step.

1. The input `lst` is `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.
2. `sorted(set(lst))` creates a set of unique elements: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
3. Then sorted converts it to a list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. Since `len(lst)` (the sorted unique list) is 5, which is ≥ 2, the function returns `lst[1]`, which is `2`.

So the output is `2`.

[THOUGHT]
The code first removes duplicates (here there are none), sorts the unique values, and returns the second smallest (index 1).  
Input list smallest is 1, next smallest is 2.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": 2        
}
```
