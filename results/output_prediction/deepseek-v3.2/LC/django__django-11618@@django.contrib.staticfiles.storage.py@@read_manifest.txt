[THOUGHT]
Let's trace through the execution step by step:

1. The function `read_manifest` is called with `self` being the ManifestFilesMixin instance.
2. Inside `read_manifest`, it tries to open `self.manifest_name` which is `'staticfiles.json'`.
3. It calls `self.open(self.manifest_name)`. In the input, `self` has attributes of a storage instance (like `_location`, `base_location`, etc.).
4. From the provided functions, `open` calls `_open`, which calls `self.path(name)`.
5. `self.path(name)` uses `self.location` (which is a cached property). In the input, `self.location` is already computed as `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr`.
6. `safe_join(self.location, name)` will join `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr` with `'staticfiles.json'`.
7. This yields the full path: `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr/staticfiles.json`.
8. However, looking at the input data, there's no `staticfiles.json` file listed in `hashed_files`. Also, the `read_manifest` function catches `FileNotFoundError` and returns `None` if the file doesn't exist.
9. Therefore, the manifest file doesn't exist, so the function will return `None`.

Thus, the output should be `null` (JSON null).
