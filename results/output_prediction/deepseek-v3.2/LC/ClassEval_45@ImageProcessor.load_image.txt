[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The `load_image` method is called with `image_path = "/home/changshu/ClassEval/data/benchmark_solution_code/test.png"`
2. Inside the method, it calls `Image.open(image_path)` which attempts to open the image file at that path
3. The Image.open() function returns an Image object if the file exists and is a valid image
4. The Image object is then assigned to `self.image`
5. The `load_image` method does not have an explicit return statement, so it returns `None` by default

Therefore, the output will be `None` since the method doesn't return anything - it only loads the image into the instance variable `self.image`.
