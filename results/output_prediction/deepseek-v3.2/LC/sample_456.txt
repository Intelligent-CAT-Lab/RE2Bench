Let's go step by step.

1. The function `f(s, tab)` returns `s.expandtabs(tab)`.  
2. In the input:  
   - `s = "Join us in Hungary"`  
   - `tab = 4`  
3. The string `"Join us in Hungary"` does not contain any `\t` (tab character).  
4. `str.expandtabs(n)` replaces each tab character in the string with spaces, but if there are no tabs, the string is returned unchanged.  

Since there's no `\t` in `"Join us in Hungary"`, the output remains the same.

Since there is no `\t` character in the input string `"Join us in Hungary"`, `expandtabs(4)` returns the string unchanged.
