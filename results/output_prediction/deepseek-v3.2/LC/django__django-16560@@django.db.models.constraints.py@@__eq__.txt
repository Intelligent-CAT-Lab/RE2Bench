[THOUGHT]
1. The input provides two CheckConstraint objects: `self` and `other` (passed via args.other).
2. The `__eq__` method of CheckConstraint first checks if `other` is an instance of CheckConstraint.
3. The `args.other` shows it has the same structure as a CheckConstraint (with check, name, etc.), so isinstance(other, CheckConstraint) should return True.
4. Then it compares:
   - self.name == other.name: "price" == "price" → True
   - self.check == other.check: Both check objects are identical (children: null, connector: "AND", negated: false) → True
   - self.violation_error_code == other.violation_error_code: "custom_code" == "custom_code" → True
   - self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message: Both are proxy objects with identical _proxy____args and _proxy____kw → True
5. Since all four comparisons are True, the method returns True.
