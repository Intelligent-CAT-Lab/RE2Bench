Let's go step by step.

**Step 1 – Read and store `n`**  
`n = int(input())`  
Input = `536870912`, so `n = 536870912`.  

**Step 2 – Initialize `x`**  
`x = 1`  

**Step 3 – Enter while loop**  
The loop condition: `while math.log2(n) % 1` means: while `math.log2(n)` is **not** an integer (i.e., has a fractional part).  

**Step 4 – Check if `n` is a power of two**  
Let’s compute `math.log2(536870912)`.  
\( 2^{29} = 536870912 \)  
So \( \log_2(536870912) = 29.0 \) exactly.  

**Step 5 – Condition check**  
`math.log2(n) % 1` is `29.0 % 1 = 0.0`, which is falsy in the while condition.  
Therefore, the **loop does not run at all**.

**Step 6 – Print `x`**  
`x` is still `1`.  

Final output: `1`
