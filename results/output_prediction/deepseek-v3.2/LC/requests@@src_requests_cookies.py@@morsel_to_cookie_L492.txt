[THOUGHT]
1. The function `morsel_to_cookie` takes a morsel as input and tries to convert it to a cookie.
2. First, it checks if morsel['max-age'] exists. In the input, morsel['max-age'] is an empty string "", which in Python evaluates to False in a boolean context. So this condition fails.
3. Next, it checks if morsel['expires'] exists. The value is "woops", which is a non-empty string and evaluates to True.
4. It then tries to parse "woops" using time.strptime() with the format '%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT'. However, "woops" does not match this format at all.
5. This will raise a ValueError when time.strptime() tries to parse "woops" with the given format.
6. The ValueError will propagate up since it's not caught in a try-except block in this part of the code (unlike the max-age section which has exception handling).
7. Therefore, the function will raise a ValueError and not return any cookie object.

Since the function raises an exception and doesn't complete successfully, the output should reflect this error condition.
