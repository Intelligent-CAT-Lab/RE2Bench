[THOUGHT]  
1. We need to predict the output of the `setup` function given the input JSON.  
2. The `setup` function takes `app` as an argument, then calls `app.add_post_transform` twice (with `ImageDownloader` and `DataURIExtractor`).  
3. Regardless of what `app.add_post_transform` does, the return value of `setup` is always:  
   `{'version': 'builtin', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True}`.  
4. The input's `args` has `app` set to a string representation, but the function doesn't use it to affect the return value.  
5. Therefore, the output is fixed.
