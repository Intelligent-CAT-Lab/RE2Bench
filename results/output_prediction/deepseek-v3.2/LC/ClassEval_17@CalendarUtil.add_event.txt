[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The CalendarUtil instance has an `events` list that currently contains one event (the New Year event from the input).
2. The `add_event` method is called with `event` being a new event dictionary identical to the existing one.
3. `add_event` simply appends this event dictionary to the `self.events` list.
4. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns `None` by default.
Therefore, the output of `add_event` will be `None`.
