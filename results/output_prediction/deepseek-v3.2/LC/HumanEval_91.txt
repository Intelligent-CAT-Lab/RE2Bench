Let's simulate the execution step by step.

The function `is_bored(S)` works as follows:  
1. Import `re` (regular expression module).  
2. Split `S` into sentences using the pattern `'[.?!]\\s*'`, which means split at `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by zero or more whitespace characters.  
3. For each `sentence` in the resulting list, check if `sentence[0:2] == 'I '` (exactly uppercase I followed by a space).  
4. Sum the boolean results (`True` = 1, `False` = 0).  

Given input `S = "bIt"`:

**Step 1:** Split `"bIt"` by `[.?!]\s*`.  
There are no `.`, `?`, or `!` in `"bIt"`, so `re.split` will return the whole string as a single "sentence":  
`sentences = ["bIt"]`.

**Step 2:** Loop over sentences:  
`"bIt"[0:2]` is `"bI"`.  
`"bI" == 'I '` → `False`.  

**Step 3:** Sum: `False` → 0.

**Final return value:** 0.

[THOUGHT]
Input string `"bIt"` has no sentence delimiters, so the split yields just `["bIt"]`. Checking `sentence[0:2] == 'I '` requires exactly an uppercase I followed by a space. Here the first two characters are `"bI"`, which is not equal to `"I "`. So the sum is 0.
