Let's execute the function step by step.  

1. The function `f` receives an empty list `array: []`.  
2. `just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array))`  
   - `map` applies the lambda function to each element of `array`.  
   - Since `array` is empty, `map` will produce an empty iterator, so `just_ns` becomes `[]`.  
3. `final_output = []` initializes an empty list.  
4. The loop `for wipe in just_ns:` iterates over each element in `just_ns`. Since `just_ns` is empty, no iterations happen.  
5. The function returns `final_output`, which is still `[]`.  

Therefore, the output is an empty list.  

[THOUGHT]
Given the input `array` is empty, `map` yields an empty list, and the loop does nothing, so `final_output` remains `[]`.

    "output": []
