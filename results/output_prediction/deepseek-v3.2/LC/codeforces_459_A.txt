Let's go step-by-step.

First, the input string is `"3 4 7 8"` (including the quotes? No — the JSON shows the `input` key's value is a string with quotes escaped as `\"`, so in Python's `input()` it would literally read `"3 4 7 8"`, including double quotes? Actually wait: The JSON is:

```json
{
    "input": "\"3 4 7 8\""
}
```

That means the *value* of `"input"` is `"3 4 7 8"` inside quotes in the JSON, but the outer quotes are JSON syntax, and `\"` escapes to `"` in the string itself. So the actual input to the Python program would be the literal characters:

`"3 4 7 8"`

So when `input()` is called, it reads `"3 4 7 8"` as a string.

Now, `anti, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` will split by whitespace. Splitting `"3 4 7 8"` (with quotes around it in the input) gives:

`split()` sees: `"3`, `4`, `7`, `8"`. Those are tokens: `"3` and `8"` have quotes attached, so `int("3")` fails? Wait, Python's `int('"3')` will raise ValueError, so the program would crash unless the quotes are not part of input.

Let’s reinterpret: maybe they meant the input string to be `3 4 7 8` but it's shown in JSON format as `"3 4 7 8"` inside escaped quotes because of how JSON works? That’s common: in the JSON `"input": "3 4 7 8"` (unescaped) means the input is `3 4 7 8` without quotes. But here they wrote `\"3 4 7 8\"` so the literal input to the program has quotes.

But that would break with `int()`. Maybe the test meant without quotes? Let’s check actual likely intended input: `3 4 7 8`.  

Assuming `input()` receives `"3 4 7 8"` literally, `split()` → `['"3', '4', '7', '8"']` → `int('"3')` → error.

So maybe it's a mistake in the problem presentation, and the input is actually just `3 4 7 8` as numbers. Most competitive programming problems give input like that.

Given the typical problem: points (anti, b) and (c, d) are given, if they are two opposite vertices of a square, find the other two vertices.

Let’s proceed assuming `input()` is `3 4 7 8`.

1. anti=3, b=4, c=7, d=8.
2. l = |3-7| = 4
3. m = |4-8| = 4
4. anti == c? 3==7 → no.
5. b == d? 4==8 → no.
6. l != m? 4 != 4 → no, so go to else.
7. else: print(anti, d, c, b) → 3 8 7 4.

Output: `3 8 7 4`.

Check: (3,4) and (7,8) are diagonal of a square with side length? l=m=4 means side length is 4*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)? Actually if l=m=4, points are diagonal ends of a square of side l*sqrt(2)/... wait: points are diagonal ends of square if horizontal diff = vertical diff. Yes, horizontal 4, vertical 4, so diagonal length 4√2, side length 4. Square vertices: other diagonal: (3,8) and (7,4). Works.

Thus output `3 8 7 4`.

[THOUGHT]
The input is likely meant to be "3 4 7 8" without extra quotes. Given that:
1. anti=3, b=4, c=7, d=8
2. l = |3-7| = 4
3. m = |4-8| = 4
4. anti != c, b != d, l == m, so else branch: print(anti, d, c, b) → "3 8 7 4".
