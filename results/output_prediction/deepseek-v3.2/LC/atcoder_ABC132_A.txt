Let’s go step-by-step.

**Step 1: Input**  
Input is `"FFEE"`, but note: the quotes are part of the input string?  
Actually, in the JSON, the value for `"input"` is `"\"FFEE\""`, which means the literal string is `"FFEE"` (including the double quotes as characters).  
So `input()` reads the 6-character string:  
`" F F E E "` (inside quotes: `F`, `F`, `E`, `E` and surrounding quotes `"` `"`).

**Step 2: Sort**  
`s = sorted(input())`  
Characters in order (ASCII):  
- `"` (ASCII 34)  
- `E` (ASCII 69)  
- `E` (ASCII 69)  
- `F` (ASCII 70)  
- `F` (ASCII 70)  
- `"` (ASCII 34)  

Sorting them gives:  
`['"', '"', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'F']`

**Step 3: Condition check**  
`s[0] == s[1]` → `'"' == '"'` → True  
`s[2] == s[3]` → `'E' == 'E'` → True  
`s[0] != s[2]` → `'"' != 'E'` → True  

All three sub-conditions are True, so `Yes` is printed.
