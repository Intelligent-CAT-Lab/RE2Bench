[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The instance is initialized with `binary_string = "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111"`
2. `calculate_binary_info()` is called with no additional arguments
3. Count zeroes: '0' appears 17 times in the string
4. Count ones: '1' appears 23 times in the string  
5. Total length: The string has 40 characters (17 + 23 = 40)
6. Zeroes percentage: 17/40 = 0.425
7. Ones percentage: 23/40 = 0.575
8. Return dictionary with these values

The binary string "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111" is actually ASCII for "hello":
- 01101000 = h
- 01100101 = e  
- 01101100 = l
- 01101100 = l
- 01101111 = o
