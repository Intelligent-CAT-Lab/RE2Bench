[THOUGHT]
We are given:
- f = [1, 2] (which represents a polynomial: 2x + 1)
- K = "ZZ" (the ring of integers)

The function `dup_l1_norm` computes the L1 norm of the polynomial, which is the sum of the absolute values of its coefficients.

Since K is ZZ, the absolute value operation is straightforward (absolute value of integers).

Steps:
1. Check if f is empty: f = [1, 2] is not empty → proceed to else branch.
2. Call `dup_abs(f, K)` to get the absolute values of coefficients.
   - dup_abs(f, K) = [K.abs(1), K.abs(2)] = [1, 2] (since abs(1)=1, abs(2)=2 in ZZ)
3. Then call K.sum([1, 2]) which sums the list: 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the output should be 3.
