Let's reason through this step by step.  

The `__invert__` method does:  

```python
def __invert__(self):
    return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))
```

But we don't have `_af_invert` defined in the provided code snippet — we only have the class definition, not the complete module. However, `__invert__` for a permutation usually means computing the inverse permutation.  

Given the input, `self._array_form` is `null` (Python `None`). In SymPy, `Permutation` can be constructed in various ways, but `_array_form` being `None` likely means the permutation hasn't been initialized with an array form.  

Still, `__invert__` would call `_af_invert(self._array_form)`, which would try to invert `None`. In SymPy's source code, `_af_invert` expects a list/tuple of integers, so passing `None` might raise an error or produce `None`.  

But looking at the class definition:  
- If `_array_form` is `None`, the permutation is identity (default), so `_size` determines its size.  
- Inverting the identity permutation should give the same identity permutation.  
- The inverse of the identity permutation of size 5 is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.  

Given the `self._size = 5`, the default `_array_form` should be `list(range(5))`.  

Let’s check:  
In `Permutation` class, if `_array_form` is None, the permutation is the identity of size `self._size`. So `self._array_form` is computed as `list(range(self._size))` somewhere in property getters.  
Thus, `__invert__` will receive `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, invert it to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` again, store in `_array_form`, and `_size` stays 5.  

So the output should be:

```
{
    "_array_form": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "_size": 5
}
```

[THOUGHT]
1. The input `self` has `_array_form = null` and `_size = 5`.
2. In `__invert__`, if `_array_form` is accessed as property, it would return the identity array form `[0,1,2,3,4]`.
3. The inverse of identity permutation is itself.
4. So `_af_new` creates a new `Permutation` with `_array_form = [0,1,2,3,4]` and `_size = 5`.
5. The returned structure matches these values.

```
{
    "_array_form": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "_size": 5
}
