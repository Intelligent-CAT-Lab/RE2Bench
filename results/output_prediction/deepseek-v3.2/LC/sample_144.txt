Let's execute the code step by step.  

1. The function `f` takes `vectors` as input. In the provided input, `vectors` is an empty list `[]`.  
2. It initializes an empty list `sorted_vecs`.  
3. The for loop `for vec in vectors:` iterates over each element in `vectors`. Since `vectors` is empty, the loop does not execute at all.  
4. `sorted_vecs` remains an empty list `[]`.  
5. The function returns `sorted_vecs`, which is `[]`.  

[THOUGHT]
Since `vectors` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
