Let's walk through the function step by step:  

1. The function `_interval_contains_close` receives `interval = [0.001, 1.0]`, `val = 0.2`, and `rtol = 1e-10`.  
2. Inside:  
   - `a, b = interval` → `a = 0.001`, `b = 1.0`.  
   - Since `a < b`, no swap occurs.  
   - `rtol = (b - a) * rtol` = `(1.0 - 0.001) * 1e-10` = `0.999 * 1e-10` = `9.99e-11`.  
   - The condition is: `a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol`.  
3. Calculate:  
   - `a - rtol` = `0.001 - 9.99e-11` ≈ `0.0009999999001`.  
   - `b + rtol` = `1.0 + 9.99e-11` ≈ `1.0000000000999`.  
   - Check `0.0009999999001 <= 0.2 <= 1.0000000000999`. This is `True`.  

So the function returns `True`.

[THOUGHT]
The interval is [0.001, 1.0], val=0.2 is clearly inside it, and even after adding a small rtol margin based on interval width, the condition still holds.  
Thus `_interval_contains_close` returns `True`.
