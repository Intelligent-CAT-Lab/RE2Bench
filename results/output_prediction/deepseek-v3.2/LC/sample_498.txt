Let’s simulate the execution step by step.  

1. The function `f` takes `nums`, `idx`, and `added`.  
2. Inside, `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` means: at slice from index `idx` to `idx` (an empty slice), insert the tuple `(added,)`. This is equivalent to inserting `added` at position `idx`, shifting the rest to the right.  
3. Input values:  
   - `nums` = `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`  
   - `idx` = `2`  
   - `added` = `3`  
   - So `(added,)` is `(3,)`  
4. Slice assignment: `nums[2:2] = (3,)` means insert `3` at index 2.  
5. The list before insertion:  
   Indexes:  0:2, 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3  
6. Insert at index 2:  
   - Elements before index 2 stay: `[2, 2, ...]`  
   - Insert 3  
   - Then original element at index 2 (which was 3) moves to index 3, and so on.  
7. New list: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.  
8. Function returns `nums`.  

[THOUGHT]
We start with nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], idx = 2, added = 3.  
Line `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` inserts the value 3 at index 2.  
The resulting list is [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3].  
This is returned.
