Let’s walk through the code step by step.

1. The input is `"20 30"`. After `input()` reads it, `.split()` splits it into `['20', '30']`.
2. `map(int, ...)` converts both to integers: `A = 20, B = 30`.
3. `ans = A - 2 * B` → `ans = 20 - 2 * 30 = 20 - 60 = -40`.
4. Since `ans < 0` is true, `ans` becomes `0`.
5. The program prints `ans`, which is `0`.
