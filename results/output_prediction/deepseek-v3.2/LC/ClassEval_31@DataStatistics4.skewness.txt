[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input data is [1, 1, 1], so n = 3.
2. mean = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.
3. Calculate variance:
   - For each x in data: (x - mean)² = (1-1)² = 0 for all three.
   - Sum of squares = 0.
   - variance = 0 / 3 = 0.
4. std_deviation = sqrt(0) = 0.
5. In the skewness calculation, there's a condition: if std_deviation != 0 else 0.
   Since std_deviation = 0, the condition is false, so skewness = 0.
6. Return 0.
