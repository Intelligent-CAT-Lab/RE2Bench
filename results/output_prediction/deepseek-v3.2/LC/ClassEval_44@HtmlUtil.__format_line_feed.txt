[THOUGHT]
1. The function `__format_line_feed` uses `re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)` to replace one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline character.
2. The input text is "Some sentence here." which contains no newline characters at all.
3. When there are no matches for the pattern `\n+`, the `re.sub` function returns the original string unchanged.
4. Therefore, the output will be exactly the input text: "Some sentence here."

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
