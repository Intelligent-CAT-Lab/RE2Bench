[THOUGHT]
The function `add_book` is called with `title="book2"` and default `quantity=1`. The inventory dictionary is `{"book1": 2, "book2": 1}`. Since `title` is already in `self.inventory`, we execute `self.inventory[title] += quantity`, which increases the value for key "book2" by 1. So `self.inventory["book2"]` becomes 2. The function `add_book` does not have a return statement; it returns `None` by default. Therefore, the output is `None`.
