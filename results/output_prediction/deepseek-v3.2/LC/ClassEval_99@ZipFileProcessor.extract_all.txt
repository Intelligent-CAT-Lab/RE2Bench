[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The method `extract_all` is called with `output_path` as an empty string.
2. Inside the method, it tries to open a zip file with `file_name` which is also an empty string.
3. When attempting `zipfile.ZipFile("", 'r')`, this will fail because an empty string is not a valid file path.
4. The `except` block catches any exception and returns `False`.
5. Therefore, the output will be `False`.
