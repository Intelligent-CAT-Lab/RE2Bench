Let’s trace through the function `f(nums)` step by step.

1. `count = len(nums)` → len([-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]) = 5.  
2. `for num in range(2, count):` → `range(2, 5)` is `[2, 3, 4]`.  
3. In each iteration:  
   - `nums.sort()` sorts the list in place, ascending order.  
   - But since the list is already sorted in ascending order initially, sorting it again doesn’t change it.  
4. Loop runs for 3 iterations (for `num = 2, num = 3, num = 4`), each time sorts the list, but no change occurs.  
5. `return nums` → returns the same list as input because it was already sorted.

So output is `[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]`.

[THOUGHT]
1. count = 5  
2. Loop runs for num = 2, 3, 4 (3 times)  
3. In each iteration, nums.sort() → does nothing because list already sorted  
4. Return original sorted list.
