Let's execute step by step.

1. The function `any_int` is called with `x=2`, `y=1`, `z=1`.
2. First check: `isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)` → all are integers → **True**.
3. Next check inside: `x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x`:
   - `x + y = 2 + 1 = 3`. Is `3 == z` (1)? → **False**
   - `x + z = 2 + 1 = 3`. Is `3 == y` (1)? → **False**
   - `y + z = 1 + 1 = 2`. Is `2 == x` (2)? → **True**
4. Since one of the three conditions is True, the `if` block returns `True`.
5. The function ends here, returning `True`.

So the output is `True`.
