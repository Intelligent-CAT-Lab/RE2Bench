Let's think through the code step by step.  

The `delete_from_database` method does the following:  

1. Connects to `self.database_name` → `"test.db"`.  
2. Creates a cursor.  
3. Forms a delete query: `DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?`.  
4. Executes it with `('Alice',)`.  
5. Commits the transaction and closes the connection.  

The method returns **nothing** (no `return` statement).  
So in Python, that means it returns `None`.  

Thus, the output in JSON should reflect `None`.
