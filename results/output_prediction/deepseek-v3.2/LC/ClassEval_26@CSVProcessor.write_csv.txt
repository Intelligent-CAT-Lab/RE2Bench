[THOUGHT]  
The method `write_csv` takes `data` and `file_name` as arguments.  
It tries to open the file with `newline=''` and writes the rows using `csv.writer`.  
If successful, it returns `1`; if any exception occurs, it returns `0`.  

Here `data` is a list of two lists: `["a","b","c","d"]` and `["ME"]`.  
`file_name` is `"read_test_process.csv"`.  
Assuming no I/O permissions or disk-space issues, the file will be created and rows written normally.  
No exception will be raised, so the function returns `1`.
