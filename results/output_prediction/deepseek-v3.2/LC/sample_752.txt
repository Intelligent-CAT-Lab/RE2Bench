[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step:
1. The function `f` takes two parameters: `s` and `amount`
2. `s` is "abc" and `amount` is 8
3. First, calculate `len(s)`: The length of "abc" is 3
4. Then compute `amount - len(s)`: 8 - 3 = 5
5. Multiply 'z' by this result: 5 * 'z' = 'zzzzz'
6. Finally, concatenate this with `s`: 'zzzzz' + "abc" = 'zzzzzabc'
7. The function returns 'zzzzzabc'
