Let's simulate the execution step by step.

The function `simplify(x, n)` is defined. The input provides `x = "7/2"` and `n = "4/2"`.

1. First line: `a, b = x.split('/')`. Splitting `"7/2"` by '/' gives `a = "7"`, `b = "2"`.
2. Second line: `c, d = n.split('/')`. Splitting `"4/2"` by '/' gives `c = "4"`, `d = "2"`.
3. Third line: `numerator = int(a) * int(c)`. `int("7") * int("4") = 7 * 4 = 28`.
4. Fourth line: `denom = int(b) * int(d)`. `int("2") * int("2") = 2 * 2 = 4`.
5. Fifth line: `if numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom):` 
   - Compute `numerator / denom` = `28 / 4 = 7.0`.
   - `int(numerator / denom)` = `int(7.0)` = `7`.
   - Check if `7.0 == 7`. This is true in Python because `7.0 == 7` returns True.
6. Since the condition is true, the function returns `True`.
7. If the condition were false, it would proceed to `return False`, but that's not needed here.

Therefore, the output is `True`.
