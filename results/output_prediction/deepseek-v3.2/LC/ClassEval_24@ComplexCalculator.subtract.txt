Let's step through this.

1. The input provides c1 as `"(-1+2j)"` and c2 as `"(-3+4j)"`. In Python, these are strings representing complex numbers.
2. In the subtract method, the calculation `c1.real - c2.real` and `c1.imag - c2.imag` will only work if c1 and c2 are actual `complex` objects, not strings.
3. The input here is given as strings in the JSON, but in a real Python call, if passed as `(-1+2j)` directly, they'd be complex literals, not strings. The JSON shows them as strings, but likely this means the literal values `(-1+2j)` and `(-3+4j)`.
4. Let's assume c1 and c2 are actual Python complex numbers:  
   c1 = (-1+2j) → real = -1, imag = 2  
   c2 = (-3+4j) → real = -3, imag = 4  
5. subtract:  
   real = (-1) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2  
   imag = 2 - 4 = -2  
6. Result = `complex(2, -2)` = `(2-2j)`.

Thus the output is `(2-2j)`.

[THOUGHT]
The input strings `"(-1+2j)"` and `"(-3+4j)"` in JSON likely represent literal complex numbers, not strings, because the method uses `.real` and `.imag` attributes. Converting them to actual complex numbers:  
c1 = -1+2j, c2 = -3+4j.  
Subtract: real part = -1 - (-3) = 2, imag part = 2 - 4 = -2.  
Result = 2 - 2j.
