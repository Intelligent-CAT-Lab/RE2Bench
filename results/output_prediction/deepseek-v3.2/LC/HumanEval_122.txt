Let’s go step by step.

1. The function `add_elements(arr, k)` returns the sum of certain elements:  
   It takes the first `k` elements of `arr`, then only keeps those whose string length is ≤ 2, and sums them.

2. Input:  
   `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  
   `k = 4`

3. Take the first `k = 4` elements:  
   `arr[:4]` → `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`

4. Check each element’s string length ≤ 2:
   - `111` → `str(111)` = `"111"`, length = 3 → keep? No.
   - `21` → `"21"`, length = 2 → keep? Yes.
   - `3` → `"3"`, length = 1 → keep? Yes.
   - `4000` → `"4000"`, length = 4 → keep? No.

5. Kept elements: `[21, 3]`

6. Sum of `21` and `3` = `24`

7. So the function returns `24`.

[THOUGHT]
We take first 4 elements: [111, 21, 3, 4000].  
Filter those whose string length ≤ 2: 111 (len 3, no), 21 (len 2, yes), 3 (len 1, yes), 4000 (len 4, no).  
Sum of kept elements: 21 + 3 = 24.
