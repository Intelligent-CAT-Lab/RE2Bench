[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern()` takes no arguments (self is just the instance but no attributes are used). It returns the pattern string as defined. So we need to output exactly what the method returns: the regex pattern for email matching.

    "output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
