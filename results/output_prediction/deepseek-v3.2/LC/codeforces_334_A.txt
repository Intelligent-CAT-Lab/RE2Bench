Let’s go step-by-step:  

1. The code reads an integer from input:  
   - `n = int(input())` → Given `"8"`, so `n = 8`.  

2. `i, j = (1, n * n)` → `n * n = 64`, so `i = 1`, `j = 64`.  

3. `while i < j` → This loop runs as long as `i < j`.  

4. Inside the loop:  
   - First iteration: `i = 1`, `j = 64` → print `1 64`, then `i` becomes 2, `j` becomes 63.  
   - Second iteration: `i = 2`, `j = 63` → print `2 63`, then `i` becomes 3, `j` becomes 62.  
   - This continues until `i` is no longer less than `j`.  

5. When will it stop?  
   - Loop condition: `i < j`.  
   - On each iteration: `i` increases by 1, `j` decreases by 1, so difference `j - i` decreases by 2 each time.  
   - Start: `i = 1`, `j = 64`.  
   - Eventually they meet: for `i = 32`, `j = 33` → prints `32 33`, then `i = 33`, `j = 32`, now `i < j` is False, loop ends.  

Let’s list a few first and last outputs for clarity:

Output:  
```
1 64
2 63
3 62
...
31 34
32 33
```

There are `32` lines of output in total (because from `1..32` paired with `64..33`).

[THOUGHT]
Simulating all 32 lines fully isn’t needed here — just need the final output pattern.  
The code prints `i` and `j` each time until they cross.

So with `n=8`, `n*n = 64`, output will be:

```
1 64
2 63
3 62
4 61
5 60
6 59
7 58
8 57
9 56
10 55
11 54
12 53
13 52
14 51
15 50
16 49
17 48
18 47
19 46
20 45
21 44
22 43
23 42
24 41
25 40
26 39
27 38
28 37
29 36
30 35
31 34
32 33
