Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The SQLGenerator is initialized with table_name="table1".
2. The `select` method is called with `args = {}` (empty positional arguments) and `kwargs = {"condition": "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"}`.
3. Inside `select`:
   - `fields` is not provided, so the default `None` is used.
   - Since `fields is None`, we set `fields = '*'`.
   - `condition` is provided as the keyword argument "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".
   - Build the SQL: 
     - Start with `SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}` → `SELECT * FROM table1`
     - Since condition is not None, append ` WHERE {condition}` → ` WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20`
     - Finally, add a semicolon: `;`
   - The final string becomes: `SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;`
