Let's simulate the execution of the function step by step.  

The function `greatest_common_divisor` implements the Euclidean algorithm:  
- `a = 10`, `b = 15` initially.  
- In the loop, while `b != 0`:  
  - First iteration: `b = 15`, `a % b = 10 % 15 = 10`.  
    So `(a, b)` becomes `(b, a % b) = (15, 10)`.  
  - Second iteration: now `a = 15`, `b = 10`.  
    `a % b = 15 % 10 = 5`.  
    So `(a, b) = (10, 5)`.  
  - Third iteration: now `a = 10`, `b = 5`.  
    `a % b = 10 % 5 = 0`.  
    So `(a, b) = (5, 0)`.  
  - Fourth iteration: `b = 0`, so loop ends.  

At the end, `a = 5`.  
The function returns `a`, which is `5`.  

Therefore, `gcd(10, 15) = 5`.
