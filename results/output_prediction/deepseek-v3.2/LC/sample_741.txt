Let's trace through the function step by step.  

1. `prev_p = p - 1` → `prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5`.  
2. Since `prev_p < 0` is `False` (5 is not < 0), we skip the `if` block.  
3. The function returns `nums[prev_p]` → `nums[5]`.  
4. Looking at `nums` list: index 0 = 6, 1 = 8, 2 = 2, 3 = 5, 4 = 3, 5 = 1, 6 = 9, 7 = 7.  
So `nums[5]` is `1`.  

The output is `1`.  

[THOUGHT]  
We computed `prev_p = 5`, not negative, so no wrap-around to end of list. `nums[5]` equals `1`.
