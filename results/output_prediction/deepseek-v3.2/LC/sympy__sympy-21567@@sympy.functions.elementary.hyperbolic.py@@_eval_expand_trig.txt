[THOUGHT]
Looking at the provided code, I need to understand what `_eval_expand_trig` does. The method is defined in the `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction` class. It calls `self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints)`.

However, I notice that the `_calculate_reciprocal` method is not defined in the provided code snippet. This suggests it might be inherited from a parent class (likely `HyperbolicFunction`), but that parent class is not fully shown.

Given the structure of the expected output, which focuses on the `nargs._args_set` property, and the fact that the method is supposed to return something related to trigonometric expansion, I need to think about what this method might typically do.

In SymPy, reciprocal hyperbolic functions like `sech`, `csch`, etc., have expansion properties. The `_eval_expand_trig` method would typically expand these functions in terms of simpler functions.

But looking at the input structure provided:
```json
{
    "self": {
        "nargs": {
            "_args_set": "{'1'}"
        }
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

This suggests that `self.nargs._args_set` is currently `"{'1'}"` (a string representation of a set containing '1'). The output structure expects me to fill in what this value becomes after the method call.

Since the method is calling `_calculate_reciprocal` with the same method name, it's likely that this method will transform the function into its reciprocal form and then call `_eval_expand_trig` on that reciprocal function.

However, without seeing the implementation of `_calculate_reciprocal`, I need to make a reasonable assumption. In SymPy, reciprocal hyperbolic functions when expanded might maintain similar argument structures.

The most straightforward interpretation is that the `_args_set` might remain unchanged or be transformed in a predictable way. Given that the input shows `"{'1'}"` and this represents the number of arguments the function takes (nargs), and reciprocal functions typically take the same number of arguments as their counterparts, the `_args_set` should likely remain `"{'1'}"`.

Therefore, the output should maintain the same structure with `_args_set` still being `"{'1'}"`.
