[THOUGHT]
The function `clean_non_binary_chars` is a method of class `BinaryDataProcessor`. It filters the `binary_string` attribute to keep only characters '0' and '1'. The input `binary_string` is already "01101000011011010110001001101111", which consists only of '0' and '1'. So after filtering, it remains the same. The method modifies `self.binary_string` but does not return anything, so the output of the method call is `None`. However, note that the method is called as `clean_non_binary_chars()` with no arguments, and it returns nothing. In the given input, we are asked for the output of `clean_non_binary_chars`. Since there is no explicit return, the function returns `None`. Therefore, the output should be `null` in JSON (which is `None` in Python). The structure expects a placeholder for "output". So we fill it with `None`.
