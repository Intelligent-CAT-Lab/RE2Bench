Let's work through this step by step.  

We are given:  

- `self` is a `DomainMatrix` with:
  - `rep`: looks like a sparse dict-of-dict representation (SDM), keys: row → column → value  
  - `shape`: `(2, 2)`  
  - `domain`: `"EXRAW"`  

The `to_list()` method just calls `self.rep.to_list()`.  
From the provided code, since `rep` is a dict-of-dicts, it's an `SDM`. So `to_list` for SDM is used.  

**SDM.to_list logic:**  
- Make `m × n` matrix of zeros (zero = domain.zero)  
- For each row `i` in dict, for each `(j, e)` in row dict, set `ddm[i][j] = e`  

Here:  
`self.rep` =  
```python
{
    0: {0: "Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])", 1: "Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])"},
    1: {0: "Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])", 1: "Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])"}
}
```

`m = 2`, `n = 2`, domain `EXRAW`. The zero for `EXRAW` might be something like `0` or `S.Zero`, but here the entries are not numbers—they are string representations of matrices. However, the input format is not parsed, so the strings themselves are the elements.  

So `ddm` starts as:  
```
[
    [zero, zero],
    [zero, zero]
]
```

Then fill:  
- `(0, 0) → "Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])"`  
- `(0, 1) → "Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])"`  
- `(1, 0) → "Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])"`  
- `(1, 1) → "Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])"`  

Resulting 2×2 list of lists:  

```
[
    ["Matrix([\n[1, 0],\n[0, 1]])", "Matrix([\n[1, 2, 3],\n[3, 5, 4]])"],
    ["Matrix([\n[4, 2],\n[2, 3],\n[7, 5]])", "Matrix([\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1]])"]
]
```

But in the input JSON, newlines were escaped as `\n`, so output should be the same.

Thus:  

[THOUGHT]  
1. `self.rep` is an SDM with 2 rows and 2 columns.  
2. `to_list` for SDM creates a 2×2 list, initialized with domain zero.  
3. The domain is EXRAW, but the zero is irrelevant because all four entries are explicitly given in `rep`.  
4. We fill them in directly.  
5. Output is exactly the 2×2 matrix with those string Matrix representations.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [["Matrix([\n[1, 0],\n[0, 1]])", "Matrix([\n[1, 2, 3],\n[3, 5, 4]])"], ["Matrix([\n[4, 2],\n[2, 3],\n[7, 5]])", "Matrix([\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1]])"]]
}
```
