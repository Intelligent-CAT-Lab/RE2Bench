Let's simulate step by step.  

1. The `check_in` method first checks:  
   `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`  
   `room_type` is `"single"`. `self.booked_rooms` is `{"single": {}}`, so `"single"` is in keys → condition is **False**.  

2. Next line:  
   `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`  
   `self.booked_rooms["single"]` is an empty dict `{}`.  
   `"guest 1"` is not in it → condition is **False**.  

3. Since no `elif` or `else` after that `if` (wait, let's check the code carefully):  

Actually, after `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`,  
the code block below it only runs if the name is in the dict.  
Since here it’s **False**, the entire indented block is skipped.  

4. The method has no explicit `return` after that block, so it returns **`None`**.
