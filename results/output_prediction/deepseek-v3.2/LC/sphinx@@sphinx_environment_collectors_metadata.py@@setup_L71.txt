[THOUGHT]
1. The `setup` function is called with one argument `app` passed via the "args" dictionary.
2. Inside the function, `app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector)` is called, but the exact effect doesn't matter for the return value.
3. The function returns a dictionary with three keys: `'version'`, `'parallel_read_safe'`, and `'parallel_write_safe'`.
4. The values are: `'builtin'`, `True`, and `True` respectively. These are hardcoded in the function and don't depend on the input.
5. Therefore, regardless of what `app` is, the output will always be this same dictionary.
