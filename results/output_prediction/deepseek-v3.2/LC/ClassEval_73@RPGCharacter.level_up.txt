[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The `level_up` method is called with no arguments.
2. It checks if `self.level < 100`: current level is 3, which is less than 100, so the condition is true.
3. `self.level += 1`: level increases from 3 to 4.
4. `self.exp = 0`: exp is reset to 0 (already was 0).
5. `self.hp += 20`: hp increases from 140 to 160.
6. `self.attack_power += 5`: attack_power increases from 30 to 35.
7. `self.defense += 5`: defense increases from 20 to 25.
8. Returns a tuple: (self.level, self.hp, self.attack_power, self.defense) = (4, 160, 35, 25).

Therefore, the output is the tuple (4, 160, 35, 25).
