[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution:
1. We have a `CurrencyConverter` instance with `self.rates` as given in the input dictionary. Note that the instance already has "CNY": 7.18 and also "KRW": 1308.84 which are in the input self.rates but not in the default rates from the class definition.
2. The method `update_currency_rate(currency="CNY", new_rate=7.18)` is called.
3. The method checks if `currency` ("CNY") is not in `self.rates`. In this case, "CNY" is in `self.rates` (value is 7.18), so the condition `if currency not in self.rates` is False.
4. Since the condition is False, the method proceeds to update: `self.rates[currency] = new_rate` sets `self.rates["CNY"]` to 7.18 (same as before).
5. The method then reaches the end without an explicit return. In Python, a function/method without an explicit return statement returns `None`.
Therefore, the output of `update_currency_rate` is `None`.
