Let’s walk through the function step by step.  

The function iterates through `lst`, and for each element `i`:  

1. Checks `i > 0` (strictly positive)  
2. Checks `i % 2 != 0` (odd integer)  
3. Checks `'.' not in str(i)` (ensures `i` is not a float with a decimal point)  

If all three conditions are met, it squares `i` and adds it to a list comprehension. Then it returns the sum of these squares.

Given input:  
`lst` is `[]`  

The list comprehension will be `[]` because there are no items.  

Sum of `[]` is `0`.

So output = `0`.

[THOUGHT]
Given `lst = []`, no items pass the filters, so the list comprehension is empty, and `sum([])` is 0.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": 0        
}
