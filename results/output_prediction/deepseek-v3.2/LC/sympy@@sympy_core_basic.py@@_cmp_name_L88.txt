Let's walk through the function step by step.

1. Input values:  
   `x` = `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>`  
   `y` = `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>`

   In reality, these are class objects, but given as strings here. In actual execution, they'd be real class references, but for this simulation we treat their names as `'ImaginaryUnit'` and `'Pi'`.

2. Inside `_cmp_name`:  
   `n1 = x.__name__` → `'ImaginaryUnit'`  
   `n2 = y.__name__` → `'Pi'`

3. Check if `n1 == n2`: They are different, so not equal.

4. Check `if not issubclass(y, Basic)`:  
   We don't have `Basic` imported here, but in SymPy, `ImaginaryUnit` and `Pi` are both subclasses of `AtomicExpr` → `Expr` → `Basic`.  
   So `issubclass(y, Basic)` should be `True`. Therefore, we skip returning `-1`.

5. `UNKNOWN = len(ordering_of_classes) + 1` — we don’t have `ordering_of_classes` in the given code, but in SymPy’s actual code it is defined.  
   From the real SymPy source, `ordering_of_classes` is defined in `sympy/core/operations.py` (for `AssocOp` sorting) but not relevant here unless explicitly imported.  
   However, since `ordering_of_classes` is not provided, I will assume it's not in this scope — so `ordering_of_classes` might be defined globally somewhere else, but since we can't see it here, I'll assume `n1` and `n2` are not in it.

6. So:
   ```python
   try:
       i1 = ordering_of_classes.index(n1)  # 'ImaginaryUnit'
   except ValueError:
       i1 = UNKNOWN
   ```
   'ImaginaryUnit' not in `ordering_of_classes` → `i1 = UNKNOWN`.

   Similarly for 'Pi', `i2 = UNKNOWN`.

7. Now, `i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN` → `True`.

   Then `return (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)`.

   Lexicographically, `'ImaginaryUnit' > 'Pi'`? Let's compare:  
   `'ImaginaryUnit'[0]` = 'I' (ASCII 73)  
   `'Pi'[0]` = 'P' (ASCII 80)  
   Actually 'P' > 'I', so 'ImaginaryUnit' < 'Pi'.

   Python comparison: `('ImaginaryUnit' > 'Pi')` is `False` (0),  
   `('ImaginaryUnit' < 'Pi')` is `True` (1).

   So `(0) - (1) = -1`.

Therefore, `_cmp_name` returns `-1`.
