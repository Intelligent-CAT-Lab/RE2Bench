Let’s go through the function step by step.

The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` checks whether `x` is equal to `n` raised to some non-negative integer exponent.

Given:  
- `x = 1`  
- `n = 1`  

1. First, it checks `if n == 1`. Since `n` is 1, this condition is true.  
2. It then returns `x == 1`. Since `x` is 1, `x == 1` is `True`.  

The loop never executes because the `if` block returns directly.

Therefore, the output is `True`.  

[THOUGHT]
We entered the `n == 1` branch, and since `x == 1` is true, the function returns `True`.
