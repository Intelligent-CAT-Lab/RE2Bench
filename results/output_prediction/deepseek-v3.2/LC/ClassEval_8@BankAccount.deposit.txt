[THOUGHT]  
We have a BankAccount class with a `deposit` method.  
1. The input shows `self.balance = 0` initially.  
2. The method `deposit` receives `amount = 300`.  
3. `amount >= 0`, so no ValueError is raised.  
4. It updates `self.balance` from 0 to 0 + 300 = 300.  
5. The method returns `self.balance`, which is now 300.  
Thus the output should be `300`.
