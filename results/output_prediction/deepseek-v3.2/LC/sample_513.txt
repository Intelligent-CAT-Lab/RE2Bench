Let's simulate the function step by step.

1. The function `f` starts with `array = []`.  
2. First `while -1 in array`: check if `-1` exists in array. It's empty, so condition is false.  
3. Next `while 0 in array`: check if `0` exists. It's empty, so condition is false.  
4. Next `while 1 in array`: check if `1` exists. It's empty, so condition is false.  
5. Return `array`, which is still `[]`.

So output is `[]`.

```
{
    "output": []
