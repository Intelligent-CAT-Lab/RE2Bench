Let’s walk through the code step by step.

1. The program expects two integers `S` and `W`.
2. The input given inside the JSON appears to be `"74 74"` (including the double quotes in the string content itself).  
   But since the input format says `input()` and the example encloses it in JSON quotes, in actual execution, `input()` would receive the raw string `"74 74"`–including the quotes.  
3. `map(int, input().split())` would try to split `input()` by whitespace and convert each part to `int`.  
   Splitting `"74 74"` (literal quotes included) yields `['"74', '74"']`.
4. Converting `'"74'` to integer fails because of the double quote, causing a `ValueError`.

Given this, the actual program would crash with an error before printing anything.  
But if the intended input was `74 74` without quotes (just the numbers), it would compare `S <= W` → `74 <= 74` → `True`, printing `unsafe`.

Since the problem says “predict the output of the function”, and the literal input includes quotes, **the code would raise an exception**, technically no normal output. But many such problems intend the input as data, not literally with quotes, unless they mean string quotes.

Given the provided input JSON format (`"input": "\"74 74\""`), I suspect they mean the input string is `74 74` without quotes, but JSON-escaped quotes are just for representation. If interpreted literally, the program fails. Given the previous example, it’s more plausible they intend `74 74` as actual input, so:

`S = 74, W = 74` → `S <= W` → `True` → prints `'unsafe'`.
