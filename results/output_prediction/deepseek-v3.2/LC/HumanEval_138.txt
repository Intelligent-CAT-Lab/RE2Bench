[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step.

1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes one argument `n`.
2. It returns `True` if both conditions are met:
   - `n % 2 == 0` (n is even)
   - `n >= 8` (n is greater than or equal to 8)
3. For the given input, `n = 10`.
   - `10 % 2 == 0` is `True`
   - `10 >= 8` is `True`
4. Since both conditions are `True`, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the output should be `True`.
