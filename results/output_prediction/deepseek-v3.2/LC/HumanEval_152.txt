Let's execute the code step by step.  

The function `compare` takes two lists `game` and `guess` and returns a list where each element is the absolute difference between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.  

Given:  
`game = [1, 2, 3, 5]`  
`guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4]`  

We pair them up using `zip(game, guess)`:  
1. (1, -1) → abs(1 - (-1)) = 2  
2. (2, 2) → abs(2 - 2) = 0  
3. (3, 3) → abs(3 - 3) = 0  
4. (5, 4) → abs(5 - 4) = 1  

So the output list is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.  

[THOUGHT]  
The output list is [2, 0, 0, 1].
