[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step:

1. The `__init__` method is called with `binary_string = "01101000011001010110001001101111"`. 
2. It calls `clean_non_binary_chars()` method, but that method is not defined in the given code snippet. However, since the binary_string contains only '0' and '1' characters, even if the method existed, it wouldn't change the string. So we can assume `self.binary_string` remains unchanged.
3. The `convert_to_ascii` method is called with no arguments.
4. It creates an empty bytearray.
5. It loops over `self.binary_string` in chunks of 8 characters:
   - First chunk: "01101000" → decimal = int("01101000", 2) = 104 → ASCII character 'h'
   - Second chunk: "01100101" → decimal = 101 → ASCII character 'e'
   - Third chunk: "01100010" → decimal = 98 → ASCII character 'b'
   - Fourth chunk: "01101111" → decimal = 111 → ASCII character 'o'
6. All bytes are appended to byte_array.
7. `byte_array.decode('ascii')` decodes these bytes to the string "hebo".

So the output should be "hebo".
