Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The function `maximum(arr, k)` is called with  
   - `arr = [-4, 4]`  
   - `k = 2`

2. Since `k` is 2 (not 0), we skip the `if` block.

3. `arr.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order:  
   After sorting, `arr` becomes `[-4, 4]`.

4. `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements from the sorted list:  
   - `k = 2`  
   - `arr[-2:]` means from the second-last element to the end:  
   - Indices: `[-4, 4]` → `arr[-2:]` = `[-4, 4]` (because there are only 2 elements, so last 2 elements is the entire list).

5. Returns `ans` = `[-4, 4]`.
