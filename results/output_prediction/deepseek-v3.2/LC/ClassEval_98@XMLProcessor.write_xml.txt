[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `write_xml` method step by step:

1. The method signature: `write_xml(self, file_name)`
2. We are given:
   - `self.root = None`
   - The argument `file_name = ""` (empty string)

3. Inside the method:
   - `tree = ET.ElementTree(self.root)` creates an ElementTree with `None` as root
   - `tree.write(file_name)` tries to write to an empty filename with `None` as root

4. Potential issues:
   - Creating an ElementTree with `None` root might not raise an immediate exception
   - Writing to an empty filename should raise an exception
   - The method catches any exception and returns `False`

5. Since `tree.write("")` will fail (empty filename is invalid), an exception will be raised
6. The except block catches it and returns `False`

7. Therefore, output should be `False`
