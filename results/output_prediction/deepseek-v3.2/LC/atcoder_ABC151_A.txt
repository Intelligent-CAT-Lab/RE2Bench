First, let's parse the input carefully. The input is given as a JSON string:

```json
{
    "input": "\"a\""
}
```

This means the actual input to the Python code is `"a"` (including the double quotes).  

So when `input()` is called in `print(chr(ord(input()) + 1))`,  
the user's entered string is `"a"` (a 3-character string: double quote, `a`, double quote).  

Now `ord()` takes the first character of that string, which is `"` (ASCII decimal 34).  

`34 + 1 = 35`, and `chr(35)` is `'#'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

`#`  

In JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "output": "#"
}
```

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "#"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
