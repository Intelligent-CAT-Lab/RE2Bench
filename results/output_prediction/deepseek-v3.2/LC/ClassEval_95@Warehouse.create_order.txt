[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step:

1. The `create_order` method is called with:
   - order_id = 1
   - product_id = 1
   - quantity = 10

2. First, it calls `self.get_product_quantity(product_id)` to check available quantity
   - product_id = 1 exists in self.inventory
   - self.inventory["1"]["quantity"] = 90
   - Returns 90

3. Check if available quantity (90) >= requested quantity (10): TRUE

4. Since condition is true, it calls `self.update_product_quantity(product_id, -quantity)`
   - This adds -10 to the current quantity
   - Current quantity was 90, after update: 90 + (-10) = 80
   - self.inventory["1"]["quantity"] becomes 80

5. Then it updates self.orders[order_id]:
   - order_id = 1 already exists in self.orders
   - Overwrites the existing order with new values:
     - product_id: 1
     - quantity: 10
     - status: "Shipped"

6. The method doesn't return any value explicitly, so it returns None by default

Therefore, the output is None.
