[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step:

1. The input shows `self` has `file_path: "test_example.docx"`.
2. The `add_heading` method is called with `heading="Test Heading 5"` and no explicit `level` argument, so `level` defaults to 1.
3. Inside the method:
   - It tries to open the document at `self.file_path` (test_example.docx)
   - Calls `doc.add_heading("Test Heading 5", 1)` 
   - Saves the document back to the same path
   - Returns `True` if successful
4. However, this depends on whether the file exists and can be opened/modified.
   - If the file exists and is accessible: returns `True`
   - If any exception occurs (file doesn't exist, permission issues, etc.): returns `False`
5. The input doesn't specify whether the file exists. Looking at the pattern from the previous example, we should assume normal successful execution unless indicated otherwise.
6. Without any indication of file issues in the input, we assume the operation succeeds and returns `True`.
