Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `string` and `encryption`.  
2. The input says `encryption` is `0`, so the condition `encryption == 0` is `True`.  
3. Therefore, the function immediately returns `string`.  
4. Since `string` is `"UppEr"`, the output should be `"UppEr"`.
