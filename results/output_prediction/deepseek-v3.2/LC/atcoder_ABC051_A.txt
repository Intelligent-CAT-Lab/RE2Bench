Let's go step-by-step.

1. The code reads input: `"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"` (including the quotes).  
2. It calls `.replace(',', ' ')`, which replaces every comma with a space.  
3. Since commas are between the words inside the quotes, they become spaces. The quotes remain unchanged.  

So:  
`"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"` → `"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"`  

The program prints that string exactly.  

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "\"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc\""
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
