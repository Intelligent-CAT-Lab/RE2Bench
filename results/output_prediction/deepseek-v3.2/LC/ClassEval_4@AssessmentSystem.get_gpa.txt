[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the get_gpa method step by step:

1. The method receives self.students dictionary as provided in the input.
2. It checks if name="Charlie" exists in self.students and if Charlie has courses.
3. Charlie exists in self.students with courses {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}
4. The method sums the course values: 70 + 80 = 150
5. It divides by the number of courses: 150 / 2 = 75.0
6. Returns this value: 75.0
