[THOUGHT]  
Let's examine the method `construct_stop_word_list`.  
It is an instance method that takes no arguments (self is passed but not used).  
It creates a list `['a', 'an', 'the']` and returns it.  
Given empty args and kwargs, calling this method will simply return that fixed list.  

Thus output is `['a', 'an', 'the']`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["a", "an", "the"]
}
