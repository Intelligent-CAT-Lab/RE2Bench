Let's walk through the logic step by step.

1. The `self.__total` is given as `150.0` (from `_DiscountStrategy__total`).
2. `self.promotion` is provided as a function reference (not `None`).  
3. In `due()`, because `self.promotion` is not `None`, it will compute  
   `discount = self.promotion(self)`.  
4. I don’t know what the promotion function does, but the input seems to have set `self.__total` to `150.0` and no other discounts are mentioned.  
   Since `discount` could be computed by the given promotion, but there's no detail here except the function object reference, maybe I should recall that in typical such code, the promotion might apply a 5% discount if total >= 100? Let's check the original exercise pattern:  
   Often `fidelity_promo` gives 5% if customer.fidelity >= 1000.  

Given `customer.fidelity` is `1200`, that condition passes, so discount = 5% of total.  
Total = 150.0, so discount = 0.05 × 150.0 = 7.5.  

5. Then `due()` returns `self.__total - discount` → `150.0 - 7.5 = 142.5`.

Thus output should be `142.5`.
