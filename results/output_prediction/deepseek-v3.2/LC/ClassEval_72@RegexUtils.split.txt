[THOUGHT]  
Let's step through the function:  

1. `self` is empty (no instance attributes needed).  
2. `args` contains `pattern = "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b"` and the given `text`.  
3. In Python string literals, `\\` becomes a single backslash. So the pattern is `\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b`.  
4. This matches phone numbers in the form `XXX-XXX-XXXX` as whole words (`\b` = word boundary).  
5. The `re.split` function splits the string by occurrences of the pattern and removes the matched parts.  
6. The text: `"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`  
7. First match: `123-456-7890` → split before/after it, but since it's at start, we get `['', ' abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767']`? Wait, careful:  
   - `re.split` with pattern at start gives an empty string as first element.  
   - Then `" abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"` remains.  
8. Next match: `876-286-9876` inside that remainder → split at that point:  
   - Part before: `" abiguygusu "`  
   - Part after: `" kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`  
9. Next match: `987-762-9767` at the end → split before it:  
   - Part before: `" kjgufwycs "`  
   - Part after: `""`  
10. So pieces are:  
    - `''` (from before first match)  
    - `' abiguygusu '`  
    - `' kjgufwycs '`  
    - `''` (from after last match)  
11. But let’s simulate precisely with Python mentally:  
    text = "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"  
    re.split(r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b', text)  
    Matches at:  
        index 0–12: "123-456-7890"  
        index 24–36: "876-286-9876"  
        index 49–61: "987-762-9767"  
    Splits yield:  
        text[0:0] = ''  
        text[13:23] = ' abiguygusu '  
        text[37:48] = ' kjgufwycs '  
        text[62:62] = ''  
    So final list: ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']  

Thus output is that list.
