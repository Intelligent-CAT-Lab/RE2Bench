Based on the provided code and input, the function `_setup` initializes a `ContinuousBase` scale object.

1.  **Copy and Defaults**:
    *   `new = copy(self)` creates a shallow copy.
    *   `new._tick_params` is `null` in the input, so `new = new.tick()` is called. This initializes `_tick_params` with default `None` values for `locator`, `at`, `upto`, `count`, `every`, `between`, and `minor`.
    *   `new._label_params` is not `null` in the input (it's a dict of nulls), so `new.label()` is skipped, preserving the existing `null` values.

2.  **Transform and Scale**:
    *   `trans` is `"log"`. `new._get_transform()` returns forward (log) and inverse (exp) functions.
    *   `new._get_scale("x", forward, inverse)` creates a Matplotlib scale. Since `trans` is "log", this corresponds to a `LogScale` (or functional equivalent), which has `_shorthand_name` as `"log"`.
    *   The `_matplotlib_scale` is assigned. Specifically, its internal `_transform` object typically has `_invalid` set to `0` (valid) upon initialization.

3.  **Normalization and Pipeline**:
    *   The property `prop` corresponds to `{"variable": "coordinate"}`. In Seaborn's system, coordinate properties (like x and y) generally have `normed=False` because the axis handles the spatial mapping, not a pre-normalization step (unlike color).
    *   Because `prop.normed` is False (implied for coordinate), `normalize` is set to `None`. The calculation of calculate min/max values from `data` is skipped.
    *   `new._pipeline` is constructed as `[axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`.
    *   Representing this list in JSON: `axis.convert_units` is a method (`{}`), `forward` is a function (`{}`), `normalize` is `None` (`null`), and the mapping is a function (`{}`). So: `[{}, {}, null, {}]`.

4.  **Legend**:
    *   Coordinate properties typically have `legend=False`. Thus, the `if prop.legend:` block is skipped, and `_legend` remains `null`.
