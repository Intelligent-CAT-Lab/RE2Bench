[THOUGHT]
The function `_parallel_poly_from_expr` converts a list of expressions into a list of `Poly` objects sharing the same domain and generators.

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    The input `exprs` is `["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"]`.
    The function iterates through these strings and calls `sympify` on them.
    *   `"2"` becomes the SymPy Integer `2`.
    *   `"-1*2*cos(phi)"` becomes the SymPy expression `-2*cos(phi)` (multiplication is evaluated).
    The list of expressions is now `[Integer(2), -2*cos(phi)]`.

2.  **Generator Identification**:
    The function calls `_parallel_dict_from_expr`.
    This helper identifies the generators for the polynomials.
    *   The first expression `2` is a constant.
    *   The second expression `-2*cos(phi)` contains the term `cos(phi)`. Since `cos(phi)` is a transcendental function and not a simple symbol, SymPy's `polys` module treats `cos(phi)` as the generator itself.
    *   The generators `gens` identified are `(cos(phi),)`.

3.  **Coefficient Extraction**:
    The expressions are viewed as polynomials in `cos(phi)`:
    *   `2` corresponds to $2 \cdot \cos(\phi)^0$. The coefficient is `2`.
    *   `-2*cos(phi)` corresponds to $-2 \cdot \cos(\phi)^1$. The coefficient is `-2`.
    The list of all coefficients is `[2, -2]`.

4.  **Domain Construction**:
    The function `construct_domain` is called with coefficients `[2, -2]`.
    Since both are integers, the constructed domain is `ZZ` (Integer Ring).
    The `opt` object (options) is updated with `domain=ZZ` and `gens=(cos(phi),)`.

5.  **Poly Creation**:
    Two `Poly` objects are created using the dictionary representations, generators, and domain.
    *   First Poly: `Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`
    *   Second Poly: `Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')`

6.  **Return Value**:
    The function returns a tuple containing the list of polynomials and the options object.
    Return: `([Poly(2, cos(phi), domain='ZZ'), Poly(-2*cos(phi), cos(phi), domain='ZZ')], opt)`
    where `opt` has `domain=ZZ` and `gens=(cos(phi),)`.

7.  **Output Formatting**:
    The result is a tuple. The string representation of the tuple containing the Polys and the Options object (here represented with its key properties for clarity) is constructed.
