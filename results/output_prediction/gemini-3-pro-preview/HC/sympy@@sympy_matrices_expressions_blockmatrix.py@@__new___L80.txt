The function `BlockMatrix.__new__` is designed to create a block matrix from a 2D sequence (list of lists) of sub-matrices. It performs several validation checks to ensure the dimensions of the blocks align correctly (i.e., matrices in the same row must have the same number of rows, and matrices in the same column must have the same number of columns).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the provided input:

1.  **Input Parsing**:
    The input provided is a list of lists containing `Matrix` objects (represented as strings mimicking their representation).
    -   **Row 1**:
        -   Matrix 1 (Top-Left): `Matrix([[4, 2], [2, 3], [7, 5]])` -> Dimensions: 3 rows, 2 columns.
        -   Matrix 2 (Top-Right): `Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])` -> Dimensions: 3 rows, 3 columns.
    -   **Row 2**:
        -   Matrix 3 (Bottom-Left): `Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])` -> Dimensions: 2 rows, 2 columns.
        -   Matrix 4 (Bottom-Right): `Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4]])` -> Dimensions: 2 rows, 3 columns.

2.  **Initial Validation**:
    -   `args[0]` is a sequence (list of lists).
    -   `rows = args[0]`.
    -   `isMat(rows)` is False because it is a list, not a Matrix.

3.  **Dimension Consistency Checks**:
    -   **Row Lengths**: `len(rows[0])` is 2, `len(rows[1])` is 2. The set of lengths is `{2}`. This is valid (`ok = True`).
    -   **Row Heights**:
        -   For row 0: Matrix 1 has 3 rows, Matrix 2 has 3 rows. Set is `{3}`. Valid.
        -   For row 1: Matrix 3 has 2 rows, Matrix 4 has 2 rows. Set is `{2}`. Valid.
    -   **Column Widths**:
        -   For column 0: Matrix 1 has 2 cols, Matrix 3 has 2 cols. Set is `{2}`. Valid.
        -   For column 1: Matrix 2 has 3 cols, Matrix 4 has 3 cols. Set is `{3}`. Valid.

    Since all checks pass (`ok` is True), no `ValueError` is raised.

4.  **Object Construction**:
    -   `mat = ImmutableDenseMatrix(rows, evaluate=False)` is created. This stores the list of lists `[[M1, M2], [M3, M4]]` inside an immutable matrix container.
    -   `obj = Basic.__new__(cls, mat)` is called. This creates a new `BlockMatrix` instance where `obj.args` contains `mat`.

5.  **Return Value**:
    -   The function returns `obj`. The representation of this object is `BlockMatrix` wrapping the `ImmutableDenseMatrix` of the blocks.
