The process involves tracking the state of the `RFE` instance (`self`) through the execution of the `_fit` method.

1.  **Initialize Parameters**:
    The `RFE` instance is initialized with:
    *   `estimator`: An `SVC` object with `kernel='linear'`.
    *   `n_features_to_select`: 4.
    *   `step`: 0.1.
    *   `verbose`: 0.

2.  **Analyze Input Data (`X`)**:
    The input `X` is provided as a string representation of a 2D array. Inspecting the structure `[[0. 0.] [0. 0.] ...]`, the inner elements like `[0. 0.]` indicate that each sample has 2 features.
    Therefore, `n_features = 2`.

3.  **Validation and Logic setup inside `_fit`**:
    *   `n_features = X.shape[1]` which is 2.
    *   **Logic for `n_features_to_select`**: The code checks `if isinstance(self.n_features_to_select, Integral)`. Here, `n_features_to_select` is 4 (integer).
    *   It compares `n_features_to_select (4) > n_features (2)`. This evaluates to `True`.
    *   A warning is issued ("There will be no feature selection..."), but the local variable `n_features_to_select` keeps the value 4.
    *   **Logic for `step`**: The code checks `0.0 < self.step < 1.0`. `self.step` is 0.1. The calculated step size would be `int(max(1, 0.1 * 2)) = 1`, but this affects the loop step, not the stored attribute `self.step`.

4.  **Feature Selection Loop**:
    *   `support_` is initialized as all ones (True) for the 2 features. Sum is 2.
    *   The loop condition is `while np.sum(support_) > n_features_to_select:` -> `while 2 > 4:`.
    *   This condition is `False` immediately. The loop body (which performs RFE recursive elimination) is skipped entirely.

5.  **Finalizing Fit**:
    *   `self.estimator_` is created by cloning `self.estimator`.
    *   It fits on all columns because `support_` is all True.
    *   The method returns `self`.

6.  **Constructing Output**:
    The structure asks for attributes of the returned `self` object.
    *   `estimator`: This holds the `SVC` instance provided in `__init__`. Its `kernel` parameter is `'linear'`. (The structure key `kernal` maps to this).
    *   `n_features_to_select`: This attribute on `self` remains 4.
    *   `step`: This attribute on `self` remains 0.1.
