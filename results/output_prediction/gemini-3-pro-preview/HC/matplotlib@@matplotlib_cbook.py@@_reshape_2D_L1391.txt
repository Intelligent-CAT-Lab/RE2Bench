The user wants to predict the output of the function `_reshape_2D` given specific inputs.

**1. Analyze the Input Data:**
The input `X` is provided as a JSON string:
`"X": "[[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409],[0.78306588, 0.97289726, 0.48320961],[0.33642111, 0.56741904, 0.04794151],[0.38893703, 0.90630365, 0.16101821],[0.74362113, 0.63297416, 0.32418002]]"`
This string contains brackets `[]` and commas `,` separating the numbers. This is the standard string representation of a Python **list of lists**. If it were a numpy array converted to a string, it typically would not have commas between elements (e.g., `[[0.9 0.1]]`). Therefore, we interpret `X` as a Python list of lists containing floats. The dimensions are 5 rows by 3 columns.

**2. Simulation of `_reshape_2D(X, name="X")`:**

*   **Step 1: `_unpack_to_numpy(X)`**
    *   `X` is a `list`.
    *   `isinstance(X, np.ndarray)` is `False`.
    *   It doesn't have `.to_numpy()` or `.values`.
    *   It is not a localized array type (Torch, JAX, TF).
    *   The function returns `X` (the list) as is.

*   **Step 2: Check `isinstance(X, np.ndarray)`**
    *   `X` is a `list`, so this is `False`. The block handling transposition of arrays is skipped.

*   **Step 3: Initialization**
    *   `len(X)` is 5 (not 0).
    *   `result = []`
    *   `is_1d = True`

*   **Step 4: Iteration `for xi in X:`**
    *   **Iteration 1:** `xi` is the first row `[0.97291764, 0.11094361, 0.38826409]`.
        *   `isinstance(xi, str)` is `False`.
        *   `iter(xi)` succeeds (it's a list).
        *   `is_1d` is set to `False`.
        *   `xi` is converted to a numpy array: `np.array([0.97..., ...])`.
        *   `np.ndim(xi)` is 1.
        *   `nd > 1` (1 > 1) is `False`.
        *   `result.append(xi.reshape(-1))` appends the 1D array of the first row to `result`.
    *   **Iteration 2 to 5:** The same process repeats for the subsequent rows. `is_1d` remains `False`. Each row is converted to a numpy array and appended to `result`.

*   **Step 5: Finalize**
    *   `if is_1d:` check is `False`.
    *   The function executes `return result`.

**3. Conclusion:**
The function returns `result`, which is a list containing 5 numpy arrays. Each numpy array corresponds to a row from the input list `X`.
(Note: This behavior differs from passing a numpy array to this function, which would transpose the data and return columns. For lists of lists, it preserves the outer list structure).

The output to be printed is the JSON representation of this list of arrays.
