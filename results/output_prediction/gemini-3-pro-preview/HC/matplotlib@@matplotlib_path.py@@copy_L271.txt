The `copy` method of the `Path` class is invoked.
1.  **Method Call**: `self.copy()` is called. `self` is a `Path` instance initialized with the data provided in the input JSON.
2.  **Execution**: Inside the `copy` method, the code executes `return copy.copy(self)`.
3.  **Shallow Copy**: The `copy.copy(self)` function creates a shallow copy of the `self` object. For a generic Python object (simulated here since no `__copy__` method is defined), this involves creating a new instance of the class and copying the contents of `self.__dict__` to the new instance's `__dict__`. `__init__` is not called on the new copy.
4.  **Attribute Persistence**: Since it is a direct copy of the state:
    *   `_vertices` remains `"array([[0., 0.],\n       [1., 1.]])"`.
    *   `_codes` remains `"array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)"`.
    *   `_interpolation_steps` remains `1`.
    *   `_simplify_threshold` remains `0.1111111111111111`.
    *   `_should_simplify` remains `False`.
    *   `_readonly` remains `False`.
5.  **Return**: The new `Path` instance is returned. The output representation should match the attributes of this returned instance, which are identical to the input `self`.
