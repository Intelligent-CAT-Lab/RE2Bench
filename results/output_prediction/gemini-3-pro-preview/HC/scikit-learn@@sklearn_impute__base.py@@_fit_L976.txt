[THOUGHT]
The function `_fit` is called with `X` (a boolean array), `y=None`, and `precomputed=True` on an instance of `MissingIndicator`.

1.  **Initialization**: The `MissingIndicator` is initialized with `features='missing-only'`, `sparse='auto'`, and `missing_values=NaN`.
2.  **`_fit` Execution**:
    *   The `precomputed` argument is `True`.
    *   The code checks `if precomputed:`. This block is entered.
    *   It verifies that `X` has a boolean dtype (`X.dtype.kind == 'b'`). The input `X` is a boolean array `[[ True, True], [False, False], ...]`. This check passes.
    *   `self._precomputed` is set to `True`.
    *   Since `precomputed` is True, `_validate_input` is skipped. Instead, `_check_n_features` is called with `reset=True`. This sets `self.n_features_in_` to `X.shape[1]`, which is 2.
    *   `self._n_features` is set to 2.
    *   `self._get_missing_features_info(X)` is called.
3.  **`_get_missing_features_info` Execution**:
    *   `self._precomputed` is True, so `imputer_mask` is set directly to `X`.
    *   `sp.issparse(X)` is False (input is a standard numpy array).
    *   The code enters the `else` block for dense arrays.
    *   Inside the `else` block:
        *   `self.features` is `'missing-only'`, so it calculates `n_missing = imputer_mask.sum(axis=0)`.
            *   The input columns alternate True/False. Both columns have 5 True values. `n_missing` is `[5, 5]`.
        *   `self.sparse` is `'auto'`. The logic `if self.sparse is True:` evaluates to False. The array `imputer_mask` remains a dense numpy array (it is not converted to CSC).
    *   The method determines `features_indices`. Since `features` is not `'all'`, it uses `np.flatnonzero(n_missing)`. Indices `[0, 1]` have non-zero missing counts.
    *   It returns `(imputer_mask, features_indices)`, which corresponds to `(X, [0, 1])`.
4.  **Completion of `_fit`**:
    *   `self.features_` is set to `[0, 1]`.
    *   The method returns `missing_features_info[0]`, which is the `imputer_mask` (which is just `X`).

The return value is the input boolean array `X`.
