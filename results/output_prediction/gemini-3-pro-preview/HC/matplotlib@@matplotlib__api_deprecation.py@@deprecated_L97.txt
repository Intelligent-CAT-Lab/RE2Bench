1. The function `deprecated` is called with the argument `since="0.0.0"` and other keyword arguments as defaults.
2. Inside `deprecated`, a nested function named `deprecate` is defined. This nested function serves as the decorator that will eventually handle the actual deprecation logic when applied to an object.
3. The `deprecated` function finishes its execution by returning the `deprecate` function itself (the closure).
4. The return value is a function object. In a text-based representation (like this output prediction), a function object is typically represented by its `repr` string. The standard Python representation for this inner function is `<function deprecated.<locals>.deprecate>`.
