[THOUGHT]
The function `_get_empty_routing` constructs a dictionary (specifically a `Bunch`) representing routing metadata for the transformers effectively present in the `ColumnTransformer`. It does this by iterating over the transformers using `self._iter` with specific flags: `fitted=False`, `skip_drop=True`, `skip_empty_columns=True`.

1.  **Iterating transformers (`_iter`)**:
    *   `fitted=False`: The method uses `self.transformers` and `self._columns` to determine the list of transformers, rather than `self.transformers_`.
    *   The `transformers` list is constructed by zipping `self.transformers` (input definitions) and `self._columns` (parsed column selections).
    *   **First Transformer ("trans")**:
        *   From input `self.transformers`: entry is `["trans", "Trans()", "<lambda>"]`.
        *   From input `self._columns`: entry is `0`.
        *   The loop variable values become: `name="trans"`, `trans="Trans()"`, `columns=0`.
        *   **skip_drop check**: `trans` ("Trans()") is not `'drop'`. This check passes.
        *   **skip_empty_columns check**: `columns` (0) refers to a specific column index. It is not an empty selection. This check passes.
        *   **Result**: The transformer "trans" is yielded.
    *   **Remainder Transformer ("remainder")**:
        *   The code checks if `self._remainder[2]` is truthy. Input `self._remainder` is `["remainder", "drop", [1]]`. `[1]` is truthy.
        *   The remainder is added to the chain: `name="remainder"`, `trans="drop"`, `columns=[1]`.
        *   **skip_drop check**: `trans` is `'drop'` and `skip_drop` is `True`.
        *   **Result**: The condition `if skip_drop and trans == 'drop':` evaluates to True, so this entry is skipped (`continue`).

2.  **Constructing the Dictionary**:
    *   The dict comprehension iterates over the yielded transformers. Only "trans" was yielded.
    *   For "trans", it creates a `Bunch` (dictionary-like object) where keys are method names found in `METHODS`.
    *   The standard `METHODS` in scikit-learn's metadata routing are: `fit`, `partial_fit`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, `predict_log_proba`, `decision_function`, `score`, `split`, `transform`, `inverse_transform`, `fit_transform`, `fit_predict`.
    *   The value for each method is an empty dictionary `{}`.

3.  **Final Output**:
    *   The result is a structure with a top-level key "trans", containing a map of all standard methods to empty dictionaries. The "remainder" key is absent because it was dropped.
