The function `get_format` is designed to retrieve format strings (e.g., for dates or numbers) based on the current locale if `use_l10n` is active, or fallback to settings. However, it also supports accepting a specific format string literal directly.

Here is the step-by-step execution:

1.  **Initialization**: The function is called with `format_type="jS \o\f F"`, `lang=None`, and `use_l10n=None`.
2.  **Resolve `use_l10n`**: Since `use_l10n` is passed as `None`, the code attempts to determine it from Django settings (`settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL` or `settings.USE_L10N`). This involves accessing the `settings` object. Regardless of whether this resolves to `True` or `False`, the outcome for this specific input is the same.
3.  **Resolve `lang`**: If `use_l10n` is active and `lang` is `None`, the current language is fetched using `get_language()`.
4.  **Format Type processing**: `format_type` is converted to a string (it already is one).
5.  **Cache Lookup**: The code checks `_format_cache`. Assuming this is the first call, it's a miss.
6.  **Module Lookup (if L10N active)**: If `use_l10n` is true, the code iterates over format modules for the current language. It attempts `getattr(module, format_type)`. Since `format_type` is `"jS \o\f F"` (a string with spaces and backslashes), it is not a valid Python identifier/variable name that would exist in a format module. Thus, `getattr` returns `None`, and `val` remains `None`.
7.  **Fallback to Settings or Literal**:
    The code proceeds to:
    ```python
    if val is None:
        if format_type not in FORMAT_SETTINGS:
            return format_type
        val = getattr(settings, format_type)
    ```
    The variable `FORMAT_SETTINGS` is a `frozenset` containing keys like `'DATE_FORMAT'`, `'DECIMAL_SEPARATOR'`, etc.
    The input string `"jS \o\f F"` is **not** in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`.
8.  **Return Literal**: The condition `if format_type not in FORMAT_SETTINGS:` evaluates to `True`. The function immediately returns `format_type`, which is `"jS \o\f F"`.

The output is simply the input string. In JSON format, the backslashes must be escaped.
