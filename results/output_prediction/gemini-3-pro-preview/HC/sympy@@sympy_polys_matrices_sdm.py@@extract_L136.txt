Based on the `extract` method logic in the `SDM` class:

1.  The method extracts a submatrix based on the provided `rows` and `cols` indices.
2.  The input arguments are `rows=[0, 1, 2]` and `cols=[0]`.
3.  The shape of the matrix `self` is `(3, 3)` (`m=3, n=3`).
4.  The extraction logic iterates through the intersection of the requested rows and the existing keys in `self`.
5.  It maps the original row indices to new row indices (`0->0, 1->1, 2->2`) and original column indices to new column indices (`0->0`).
6.  For the output structure to contain keys `"0", "1", "2"` and sub-keys `"0"`, the input matrix `self` must define values at positions `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(2, 0)`.
7.  Although the provided input JSON for `self` lacks the explicit dictionary items (likely due to serialization effectively showing attributes but missing the dictionary content), the requested output structure implies that non-zero data exists at these coordinates.
8.  Given the domain is `ZZ` (Integers) and the structure implies non-zero elements existed to be extracted, and in the absence of explicit values in the truncated input, we assume the standard test case values of `1` (representing existence/ones).
