The function `_mask_nc` is designed to process a SymPy expression, identify non-commutative sub-expressions or symbols, and replace them with commutative dummy variables ("masking" them), returning the masked expression, a dictionary to unmask them later, and a list of the non-commutative symbols found.

Here is the step-by-step execution logic:

1.  **Input Parsing**: The input argument `eq` is provided as a string `"sin(\"Sum(x, (x, 1, 2)\")) + 1"`. In the context of SymPy, this represents the mathematical expression $1 + \sin(\sum_{x=1}^{2} x)$. The inner string "Sum..." suggests a Sum object is being created, or a Symbol with that name. Standard SymPy objects (Integer `1`, Symbol `x`, function `sin`, concrete `Sum`) are **commutative** by default. Explicitly non-commutative symbols (e.g., matrices or symbols created with `commutative=False`) are required to make an expression non-commutative.

2.  **Commutativity Check**:
    The first significant logic block in `_mask_nc` is:
    ```python
    expr = eq
    if expr.is_commutative:
        return (eq, {}, [])
    ```
    The expression `sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1` consists entirely of commutative components (Symbol `x`, Integer `1`, `Sum`, `sin`, `Add`). Therefore, the property `expr.is_commutative` evaluates to `True`.

3.  **Return**: Since the expression is commutative, the function bypasses the complex traversal and replacement logic intended for non-commutative expressions. It returns a tuple containing:
    *   The original expression `eq`.
    *   An empty dictionary `{}` (as no substitutions were made).
    *   An empty list `[]` (as no non-commutative symbols were found).

4.  **Formatting Output**: The result is `(sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1, {}, [])`. In the input/output JSON format, the expression is represented as a string, the dictionary as a JSON object, and the list and tuple as JSON arrays.
