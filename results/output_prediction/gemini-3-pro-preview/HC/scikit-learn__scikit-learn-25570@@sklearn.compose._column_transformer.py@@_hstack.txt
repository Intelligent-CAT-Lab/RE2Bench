The method `_hstack` is called with `Xs` passed as `None` (derived from the input `{"args": {"Xs": null}}`).

1.  **Check `sparse_output_`**: The instance attribute `sparse_output_` is `False`.
2.  **Branch execution**: The code enters the `else` block of the `if self.sparse_output_:` statement.
3.  **List Comprehension**: The code attempts to execute the line:
    ```python
    Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
    ```
4.  **Iteration Error**: The list comprehension tries to iterate over `Xs`. Since `Xs` is `None`, this operation fails.
5.  **Exception**: A `TypeError` is raised because `NoneType` is not iterable.

Therefore, the function does not return a value but raises an exception.
