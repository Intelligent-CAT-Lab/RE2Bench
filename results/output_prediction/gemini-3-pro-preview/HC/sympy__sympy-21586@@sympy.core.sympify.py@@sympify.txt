The code to be executed is `sympify(a="2500/pi", strict=True)`.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze Input**: Variable `a` is the string `"2500/pi"`. Variable `strict` is `True`.
2.  **Initial Checks**:
    *   `getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)` is `None` for a string.
    *   `converter` lookup for `str` fails (empty dict).
    *   `a` is not `None`.
    *   `_is_numpy_instance(a)` is False.
    *   `_sympy_` attribute check fails.
3.  **Strict Mode Logic**:
    *   The code contains a block:
        ```python
        if not isinstance(a, str):
            # ... (skipped because a is a string)
        if strict:
            raise SympifyError(a)
        ```
    *   Since `a` is a string (`"2500/pi"`), the condition `isinstance(a, str)` is true, so the first `if` block (which handles non-strings) is skipped.
    *   The execution flow moves immediately to `if strict:`.
    *   Since `start` is `True` (from input kwargs), the condition is met.
    *   The statement `raise SympifyError(a)` is executed.
4.  **Result**: The function does not return a value; it raises a `SympifyError` with the message `"2500/pi"`. Since the prompt asks to predict the output, and the execution results in an exception, the output is the exception object representation.
