[THOUGHT]
The function `switch_backend` is called with the argument `newbackend` set to "Agg".

1.  **Check for Auto Sentinel**: The first step in the function checks `if newbackend is rcsetup._auto_backend_sentinel`. Since "Agg" is a string literal and not the specific sentinel object, this condition evaluates to False. The `if` block is skipped.

2.  **Load Backend Module**: The code proceeds to `old_backend = rcParams._get('backend')` (which gets the current backend) and then `module = backend_registry.load_backend_module(newbackend)`. It attempts to load the module associated with "Agg". In a standard Matplotlib environment, this loads `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg`.

3.  **Check Interactive Framework**: It retrieves `canvas_class` and checks `required_interactive_framework`. The "Agg" backend is non-interactive, so `required_framework` is typically `None`. Consequently, the check for conflicting interactive frameworks is skipped.

4.  **Setup `backend_mod`**: The code dynamically creates a `backend_mod` class that wraps the loaded module's namespace. It populates helper methods like `new_figure_manager` if they are missing from the module (though `backend_agg` usually behaves predictably here).

5.  **Configure Show**: Logic runs to determine the `show` function. For "Agg", this is handled internally without error.

6.  **Update Global State**:
    *   The backend version is logged.
    *   The optional block for 'ipympl' or 'widget' is skipped since `newbackend` is "Agg".
    *   `rcParams['backend']` and `rcParamsDefault['backend']` are updated to "Agg".
    *   The global `_backend_mod` is updated.
    *   Signatures of global functions (`new_figure_manager`, etc.) are updated to match the backend's implementations.
    *   `matplotlib.backends.backend` is set to "Agg".

7.  **Install Hooks**: `install_repl_displayhook()` is called. Based on the provided helper function, this either registers IPython hooks or sets a flag for plain Python, returning `None`. It does not raise `NotImplementedError` in standard contexts.

8.  **Return**: The function reaches the end of its execution block. There is no explicit `return` statement, which in Python means the function returns `None`.
