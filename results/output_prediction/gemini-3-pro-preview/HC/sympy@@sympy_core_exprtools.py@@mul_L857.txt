Inside the `Term.mul` method:

1.  **Coefficient Calculation**:
    The code executes `coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff`.
    From the input, `self.coeff` is `1` and `other.coeff` is `1`.
    `coeff = 1 * 1 = 1`.

2.  **Numerator Calculation**:
    The code executes `numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)`.
    `self.numer` is `Factors({})` (representing 1).
    `other.numer` is `Factors({})` (representing 1).
    The `Factors.mul` method merges the dictionaries of factors by adding exponents. Since both are empty, the result is an empty dictionary.
    `numer` becomes `Factors({})`.

3.  **Denominator Calculation**:
    The code executes `denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)`.
    `self.denom` is `Factors({})`.
    `other.denom` is `Factors({})`.
    Similarly, `denom` becomes `Factors({})`.

4.  **Normalization**:
    The code executes `numer, denom = numer.normal(denom)`.
    `numer.normal(denom)` removes common factors.
    Since both `numer` and `denom` have no factors (dictionaries are empty), no reduction happens.
    `numer` remains `Factors({})`.
    `denom` remains `Factors({})`.

5.  **Return**:
    The code returns `Term(coeff, numer, denom)`.
    Substituting the calculated values: `Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))`.
