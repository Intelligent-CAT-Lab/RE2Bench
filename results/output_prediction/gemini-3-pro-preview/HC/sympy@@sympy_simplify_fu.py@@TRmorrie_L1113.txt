The function `TRmorrie` is designed to simplify expressions involving products of cosines using Morrie's Law (e.g., $\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k x) = \frac{\sin(2^n x)}{2^n \sin(x)}$).

1.  **Input Processing**: The input `rv` is given as `"cos(phi)"`. Within the context of SymPy, this represents a trigonometric function object `cos(phi)`.
2.  **Traversal**: The function calls `bottom_up(rv, f)`. `bottom_up` recursively visits nodes in the expression tree from the leaves up to the root.
    *   It first visits `phi`. The handler `f` is called on `phi`.
    *   Inside `f(phi)`: `phi` is a `Symbol`, so `phi.is_Mul` is `False`. It returns `phi`.
    *   It then visits the root `cos(phi)`. The handler `f` is called on `cos(phi)`.
3.  **Handler Logic (`f`)**:
    *   The first check in `f` is `if not rv.is_Mul: return rv`.
    *   The object `cos(phi)` is an instance of `cos` (which falls under `Function` or `Expr`), not `Mul` (which represents multiplication). Thus, `is_Mul` is `False`.
    *   The function returns `cos(phi)` immediately without executing the Morrie's law logic (which extracts arguments, handles powers of 2 coefficients, etc.).
4.  **Result**: The `bottom_up` traversal completes, returning the original expression unchanged.
