The `_make_test_folds` method in `StratifiedKFold` generates an array of fold indices (0 to `n_splits-1`) for each sample in `y`. It aims to preserve the percentage of samples for each class. 

Here is the step-by-step execution:
1.  **Input Analysis**:
    -   `n_splits` = 5.
    -   `shuffle` = False.
    -   `y` is a numpy array (provided as string) of 150 elements. It contains three classes: 0, 1, and 2.
    -   Counting the classes in `y`: Class 0 appears 50 times, Class 1 appears 50 times, Class 2 appears 50 times. The dataset is perfectly balanced.

2.  **Stratification Logic**:
    -   The method sorts the classes and assigns folds to samples of each class.
    -   Since `shuffle=False`, the method iterates through the occurrences of each class in the order they appear in `y` and assigns them to folds cyclically.
    -   With 50 samples per class and 5 splits, each split gets exactly 10 samples of each class.
    -   For each class (0, 1, and 2), the first 10 occurrences in `y` are assigned to fold 0. The next 10 occurrences are assigned to fold 1, and so on, up to the last 10 occurrences which go to fold 4.

3.  **Fold Assignment Calculation**:
    We iterate through `y` and assign a fold index based on the count of the class seen so far.
    -   **Fold 0**: Assigned to the 1st-10th occurrence of class 0, 1st-10th occurrence of class 1, and 1st-10th occurrence of class 2.
        -   Indices receiving 0: 0-23, 25-26, 28-31 (based on class positions).
    -   **Fold 1**: Assigned to the 11th-20th occurrences.
        -   Indices receiving 1: 24, 27, 32-53, 55-56, 58, 60-62.
    -   **Fold 2**: Assigned to the 21st-30th occurrences.
        -   Indices receiving 2: 54, 57, 59, 63-77, 81-86, 88-90, 93, 95, 100.
    -   **Fold 3**: Assigned to the 31st-40th occurrences.
        -   Indices receiving 3: 78-80, 87, 91-92, 94, 96-99, 101-110, 112-120.
    -   **Fold 4**: Assigned to the 41st-50th occurrences.
        -   Indices receiving 4: 111, 121-149.

4.  **Result Construction**:
    Combining these assignments into an array representing the fold index for each sample in `y`.
