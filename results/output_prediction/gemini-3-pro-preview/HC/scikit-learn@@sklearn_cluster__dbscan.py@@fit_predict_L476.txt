The `fit_predict` method performs DBSCAN clustering using the provided parameters.

1.  **Initialization**: `DBSCAN` is initialized with `eps=0.5` and `min_samples=5`. The `sample_weight` array is provided.
2.  **Fitting**:
    *   The algorithm computes the distance matrix between all points in `X`.
    *   For each point, it identifies neighbors within the radius `eps` (0.5).
    *   It calculates the sum of `sample_weight` of these neighbors. Note that unlike standard DBSCAN which counts points, this implementation sums their weights to check against `min_samples`.
    *   **Core Points**: A point is a core point if the weighted sum of its neighbors (including itself) is $\ge$ `min_samples` (5).
    *   **Clusters**: Clusters are formed by connecting core points and their neighbors. Points not reachable from any core point are labeled as noise (-1).

3.  **Trace Analysis & Calculation**:
    *   **Group 1 (Indices 0-19)**: Contains 20 points centered roughly around (11.2, 11).
        *   Points are dense. Weights are generally high (3, 4, 3, etc.).
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 10: (9.98, 11.26). Distances to nearest neighbors (e.g., index 16, 4) are > 0.5. Weight is 3. Neighbors sum < 5. Label: **-1**.
            *   Index 16: (10.64, 10.21). Distances to nearest (index 19, 9) are > 0.5. Weight is 3. Label: **-1**.
        *   The rest (0-9, 11-15, 17-19) form a connected component where core conditions are met. Label: **0**.

    *   **Group 2 (Indices 20-39)**: Contains 20 points centered roughly around (8.8, 9).
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 21: (8.32, 9.78). Nearest neighbor is index 23 (8.50, 9.31). Distance $\approx \sqrt{0.18^2 + 0.47^2} \approx 0.503 > 0.5$. Isolated. Label: **-1**.
        *   The rest form a connected component. Even points with weight 0 (e.g., 23, 24, 33, 38) are within 0.5 distance of core points (like 34, 31, 26) and get pulled into the cluster. Label: **1**.

    *   **Group 3 (Indices 40-59)**: Contains 20 points centered roughly around (11, 9.4).
        *   **Outliers**:
            *   Index 50: (11.75, 8.46). Nearest is 58 (11.38, 8.94) at dist $\approx 0.6$. Isolated. Label: **-1**.
            *   Index 41: (11.19, 8.39) and Index 53: (10.83, 8.70).
                *   Distance between 41 and 53 is $\approx 0.475 < 0.5$. They are neighbors.
                *   Weight 41 is 0. Weight 53 is 4.
                *   Sum of weights for 41 = 4. Sum of weights for 53 = 4.
                *   Neither reaches `min_samples=5`. Since they are not connected to the main group (checked distances to 58, 43 etc. are > 0.5), they are noise. Labels: **-1**.
        *   The main group (40, 42-49, 51-52, 54-59) is connected. Label: **2**.

    *   **Labels**: The final labels array corresponds to the cluster ID for each point, or -1 for noise.
