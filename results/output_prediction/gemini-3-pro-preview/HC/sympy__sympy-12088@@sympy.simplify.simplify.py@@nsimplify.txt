The provided input `expr` represents a **FiniteSet** containing the element `1`, i.e., `FiniteSet(1)`. The structure `{"nargs": {"_elements": "frozenset({1})" }}` is a serialized representation of this SymPy object.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Identify Input**: The `expr` argument is given as a JSON object mimicking a `FiniteSet(1)`. When deserialized/sympified, `expr` is `FiniteSet(1)`.
2.  **Initial Check**: The function `nsimplify` starts by trying `sympify(as_int(expr))`. `as_int` attempts to convert `FiniteSet(1)` to an integer. This raises a `TypeError` because a set cannot be converted to an integer. The exception is caught.
3.  **Sympify and Replace**: `expr` is reassigned using `sympify(expr)`. It remains `FiniteSet(1)`. The `.xreplace(...)` handles infinities, which aren't present.
4.  **Infinity Check**: `expr` is not `S.Infinity` or `S.NegativeInfinity`.
5.  **Rational/Symbols Check**: `rational` is `None` (default). `expr.free_symbols` is empty for `FiniteSet(1)`. The condition `if rational or expr.free_symbols:` evaluates to False.
6.  **Tolerance Calculation**: `expr.atoms(Float)` is empty because `1` is an Integer. Tolerance defaults to `10**-15`.
7.  **Evaluation**: `expr.evalf(prec, chop=True)` is called. For a `FiniteSet` containing integers, `evalf` generally returns the object itself (or a set with evaluated elements). Since `1` evaluates to `1.0` only if forced or if it were a float, and `Basic.evalf` typically behaves non-destructively on containers in this context (or assuming standard library behavior where `nsimplify` handles iterables/containers by recursion which is implied or missing in the snippet), the conceptual value remains `FiniteSet(1)`. Note: The provided snippet is missing the iterable check usually present in `nsimplify`, which would normally recurse here. However, based on the goal of `nsimplify` (simplifying numbers/floats to rationals), an input with no floats like `FiniteSet(1)` remains unchanged.
8.  **Result**: Since there are no Floats to simplify and `FiniteSet(1)` is already "simple" (containing exact Integer 1), the function returns the input `FiniteSet(1)`.
9.  **Formatting**: The string representation of `FiniteSet(1)` in SymPy is `{1}`.
