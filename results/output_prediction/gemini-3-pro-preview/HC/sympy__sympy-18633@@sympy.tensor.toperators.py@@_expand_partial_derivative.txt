To predict the output of `_expand_partial_derivative`, we simulate the execution with the given (assumed) input context.

1.  **Context**: The function `_expand_partial_derivative` is a method of the `PartialDerivative` class in SymPy. It is responsible for checking if the partial derivative can be expanded (e.g. by product rule or linearity) or determining the resulting tensor index structure.
2.  **Input State**: The input JSON provides `self` with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` set to `null`. It implies the `_args` (which store the definition of the partial derivative `(expr, *variables)`) aren't explicitly listed in the JSON snippet but are required for the properties `self.expr` and `self.variables` to work.
    *   The `null` values for index structures suggest we are dealing with a case where indices haven't been computed or it matches a scalar case (rank 0) where these would eventually be empty.
    *   Given the output structure asks for `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` fields, the return value is expected to be a `TensExpr` (like `PartialDerivative`), not `S.Zero` (which doesn't have these attributes). This implies `self.expr` is not a constant (it has free symbols) and likely a scalar symbol or scalar tensor to be consistent with the simple input representation.
3.  **Execution - Step 1 (`_contract_indices_for_derivative`)**:
    *   The code calls `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`.
    *   Assuming a scalar scenario (e.g., `PartialDerivative(A, x)` where A and x are symbols):
        *   `expr` has no indices.
        *   `variables` has no indices.
        *   `_contract_indices_for_derivative` relies on `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices`.
        *   For scalars, this returns `args` (the symbols), `indices=[]` (empty list), `free=[]` (empty list), and `dum=[]` (empty list).
4.  **Execution - Step 2 (Object Creation)**:
    *   `obj = self.func(*args)` creates a new `PartialDerivative` instance.
    *   `obj._indices` is set to `indices` (`[]`).
    *   `obj._free` is set to `free` (`[]`).
    *   `obj._dum` is set to `dum` (`[]`).
5.  **Execution - Step 3 (Logic Checks)**:
    *   `if not args[0].free_symbols`: Assumed false (A is a symbol).
    *   `elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensAdd)`: False for a symbol.
    *   `elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensMul)`: False for a symbol.
6.  **Return**: The function returns `obj` (the `result`).
7.  **Result Extraction**: We extract the attributes `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` from `obj`. They are all empty lists `[]`.
