The input `self` object contains `n_features_in_` set to 5, and `statistics_` with 5 elements. The input `X` is represented as `"[]"`, which in the context of `_sparse_fit` (which expects a sparse matrix) and the existing feature count, implies an empty sparse matrix with 5 columns (features) and 0 rows (samples). That is, a shape of `(0, 5)`.

Let's trace `_sparse_fit` with `X` being a CSC matrix of shape `(0, 5)`:

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `X.shape` is `(0, 5)`. `X.indptr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (since there are no elements).
    *   `missing_values` is `NaN`.
    *   `strategy` is `'mean'`. `fill_value` is `0` (though not used for 'mean').
    *   `self.keep_empty_features` is `False`.

2.  **`_get_mask`**:
    *   `missing_mask = _get_mask(X, NaN)`.
    *   Since `X` has no data (0 rows), the mask is also an empty sparse matrix of shape `(0, 5)`.
    *   `mask_data` is empty.

3.  **Implicit Zeros**:
    *   `n_implicit_zeros = X.shape[0] - np.diff(X.indptr)`
    *   `X.shape[0]` is 0.
    *   `np.diff(X.indptr)` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   `n_implicit_zeros` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

4.  **Loop over features** (`i` from 0 to 4):
    *   `statistics` array of size 5 is created.
    *   **Iteration (for each column)**:
        *   `column` (data slice) is empty.
        *   `mask_column` (mask slice) is empty.
        *   `n_explicit_zeros` (zeros in data) is 0.
        *   `n_zeros` = `n_implicit_zeros[i]` (0) + `n_explicit_zeros` (0) = 0.
        *   **Condition check**: `if len(column) == 0 and self.keep_empty_features:`. `len(column)` is 0, but `keep_empty_features` is `False`. Condition fails.
        *   **Strategy 'mean'**:
            *   `s = column.size + n_zeros` = 0 + 0 = 0.
            *   `statistics[i] = np.nan if s == 0 else ...`
            *   Since `s` is 0, `statistics[i]` becomes `np.nan`.

5.  **Finalization**:
    *   `_fit_indicator` does nothing because `add_indicator` is `False`.
    *   The function returns `statistics`, which is `[NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN]`.
