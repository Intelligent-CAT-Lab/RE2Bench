[THOUGHT]
The function `_safe_repr` is called with the following arguments:
- `object`: "dictionary" (a generic Python string)
- `context`: A dictionary (values representing object IDs found in recursion stack)
- `maxlevels`: `None`
- `level`: 1
- `changed_only`: `True`

Execution steps:
1.  **Type Determination**: The code first executes `typ = type(object)`. Since `object` is the string `"dictionary"`, `typ` is `<class 'str'>`.
2.  **Scalar Check**: The code checks `if typ in pprint._builtin_scalars:`. The `pprint` module defines builtin scalars to include `str`, `int`, `float`, etc. Since `str` is in this set, the condition is `True`.
3.  **Return**: The function immediately returns `(repr(object), True, False)`.
    -   `repr("dictionary")` returns the string `'dictionary'` (including the single quotes).
    -   The second element is `True` (indicating the representation is readable).
    -   The third element is `False` (indicating no recursion was detected).

The final return value is the tuple `("'dictionary'", True, False)`. In the JSON output structure, this is represented as a list.
