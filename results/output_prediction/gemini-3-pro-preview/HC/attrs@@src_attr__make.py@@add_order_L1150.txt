The function `add_order` is a method of the `_ClassBuilder` class. Its purpose is to add ordering methods (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) to the class being built (stored in `self._cls_dict` or `self._cls`), and then return the builder instance (`self`) to allow for method chaining.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  **Retrieve Class Dictionary**: The method accesses `self._cls_dict`, which holds the namespace of the class being created.
2.  **Generate Ordering Methods**: It calls `_make_order(self._cls, self._attrs)`. This helper function (provided in the context) generates the comparison functions (`__lt__`, `__le__`, etc.) based on the attributes of the class.
3.  **Add Dunder Methods**: It iterates through these generated functions. for each function `meth`, it calls `self._add_method_dunders(meth)`. This adds metadata like `__module__`, `__qualname__`, and `__doc__` to the functions.
4.  **Update Class Dictionary**: The decorated functions are assigned to the keys `'__lt__'`, `'__le__'`, `'__gt__'`, and `'__ge__'` within `self._cls_dict`.
5.  **Return Self**: Finally, the method executes `return self`.

**Prediction:**
The method returns the `self` instance. The input provides a JSON representation of `self` containing the keys `"auto_attribs"`, `"these"`, and `"has_custom_setattr"`. Although `add_order` modifies the internal state of `self` (specifically `_cls_dict`, which is not visible in the input representation), it does not modify the attributes listed in the input representation, nor does it return a different object. Therefore, the output corresponds to the input `self` structure.
