To predict the output, we simulate the execution of the `_eval_pos_neg` method on the SymPy expression `-phi` with the argument `sign=1`.

**1. Input Interpretation:**
*   **`self`**: The string `"-phi"` represents a SymPy expression. In the context of SymPy, `phi` typically refers to the Golden Ratio constant (`S.GoldenRatio`), which is approximately 1.618 and is a positive real number. The expression `-phi` is therefore interpreted as a multiplication: `Mul(-1, S.GoldenRatio)`.
    *   This `Mul` object has arguments usually sorted or structured as `args = (-1, S.GoldenRatio)`.
*   **`sign`**: The input argument is `1`. In SymPy's `_eval_pos_neg` convention, passing `1` roughly asks "Is this expression positive?".

**2. Execution Trace of `_eval_pos_neg(self, sign=1)`:**

*   **Initialization**:
    *   `saw_NON = False`
    *   `saw_NOT = False`
    *   `sign` is initially `1`.

*   **Loop over `self.args`**: `(-1, S.GoldenRatio)`

    *   **Iteration 1 (`t = -1`):**
        *   Checks `t.is_extended_positive`: `-1` is not positive (False).
        *   Checks `t.is_extended_negative`: `-1` is negative (True).
        *   Action: `sign` is negated. `sign` becomes `-1`.
        *   The loop continues to the next item.

    *   **Iteration 2 (`t = S.GoldenRatio`):**
        *   Checks `t.is_extended_positive`: The Golden Ratio is positive (True).
        *   Action: `continue` (skip remaining checks for this item and proceed).

*   **After Loop**:
    *   Verification of state:
        *   `sign` is `-1`.
        *   `saw_NON` is `False`.
        *   `saw_NOT` is `False`.

*   **Final Return Logic**:
    *   Checks `if sign == 1 and saw_NON is False and (saw_NOT is False)`:
        *   `-1 == 1` is False. The condition fails.
    *   Checks `if sign < 0`:
        *   `-1 < 0` is True.
    *   Action: `return False`.

**3. Conclusion:**
The function determines that the expression `-phi` (a negative number times a positive number) is negative. Since the function was asked to evaluate against `sign=1` (positive), and the calculated sign is negative (`-1`), it returns `False`.
