The execution flow is as follows:

1.  **Method Call**: The `fit` method of the `FeatureUnion` instance is called with `X` (a large 2D array), `y` (a 1D array), and `kwargs` containing `{'a': 0}`.
2.  **State Inspection**: The instance's `self` dictionary corresponds to the input provided. Specifically, `self.transformer_list` is `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
3.  **`fit` Execution**:
    ```python
    def fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params):
        transformers = self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one)
        # ...
    ```
    The method immediately calls `self._parallel_func`.
4.  **`_parallel_func` Execution**:
    ```python
    def _parallel_func(self, X, y, fit_params, func):
        self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list)
        # ...
    ```
    The first line attempts to convert `self.transformer_list` to a list.
5.  **Exception**: Since `self.transformer_list` is `None`, calling `list(None)` raises a `TypeError` ('NoneType' object is not iterable).
6.  **Outcome**: The execution of the method halts due to the unhandled exception. The assignment `self.transformer_list = ...` does not complete because the right-hand side evaluation fails. Consequently, the state of the object `self` remains unchanged from its input state.

The output will reflect the unchanged state of the object variables.
