Inside the `radsimp` function:

1.  **Initialization**: The function is called with `expr = 1/(a - b)`, `symbolic = False`, and `max_terms = 1`.

2.  **Expression Separation**:
    The line `coeff, expr = expr.as_coeff_Add()` separates the additive constant. For `1/(a - b)`, `coeff` is `0` and `expr` remains `1/(a - b)`.

3.  **Normalization**:
    `expr = expr.normal()` keeps the expression as `1/(a - b)` since it's already in normal form.

4.  **Fraction Decomposition**:
    `old = fraction(expr)` gets the numerator and denominator: `old = (1, a - b)`.

5.  **`handle(expr)` Execution**:
    - The `handle` inner function is called with `1/(a - b)`.
    - Inside `handle`:
        - `n, d = fraction(expr)` gives `n=1`, `d=a - b`.
        - The checks `if expr.is_Atom` (False), `elif not n.is_Atom` (False since 1 is Atom), `elif n is not S.One` (False) are skipped.
        - `elif d.is_Mul` (False, it is an Add).
        - Next checks the condition: `if not symbolic and d.free_symbols:`
            - `symbolic` is `False` (from arguments).
            - `d` is `a - b`. Provided `a` and `b` are symbols, `d.free_symbols` is `{a, b}`, which is truthy.
            - The condition `not symbolic` is True, and `d.free_symbols` is True.
        - The condition evaluates to True.
    - `return expr`: The function returns the expression unmodified.

6.  **Reconstruction**:
    - Back in the main function body: `n, d = fraction(handle(expr))` results in `n=1`, `d=a - b`.
    - The check `if old != (n, d):` compares `(1, a - b)` with `(1, a - b)`. It is False.
    - The final return statement is `return coeff + _unevaluated_Mul(n, 1 / d)`.
    - This evaluates to `0 + _unevaluated_Mul(1, 1 / (a - b))`.
    - `_unevaluated_Mul` creates a `Mul` object with `evaluate=False`.
    - `Mul(1, 1/(a - b), evaluate=False)` is creating a product of 1 and the fraction.
    - When converted to a string (for output), SymPy's printer suppresses the multiplicative identity `1`.
    - The resulting string is `1/(a - b)`.
