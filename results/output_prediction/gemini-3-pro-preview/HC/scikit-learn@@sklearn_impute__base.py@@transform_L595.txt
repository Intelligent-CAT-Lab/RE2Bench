Depending on the provided method, arguments, and class state, here is the prediction for the output.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Imputer Configuration**: The `SimpleImputer` is fitted (`check_is_fitted` passes because `statistics_` and `_fit_dtype` are present). The strategy is `mean`. `add_indicator` is `False`. `copy` is `True`.
2.  **Input Validation**: The input `X` is provided as a list of lists. It contains `NaN` values. The `_validate_input` method converts this to a numpy array of `float64` and validates the structure. It returns a copy since `copy=True`.
3.  **Missing Mask**: `_get_mask(X, NaN)` identifies the positions of missing values in `X`.
4.  **Imputation Logic**:
    *   The code identifies the statistics to use for replacement. Since `keep_empty_features` is `False`, it checks for features (columns) that might be entirely missing in the statistics. In this case, `statistics_` contains values for all 4 features: `[5.80707965, 3.07211538, 3.75545455, 1.19722222]`.
    *   It calculates replacement values. The code uses `np.where` on the transposed mask to find coordinates effectively grouping by feature. It constructs a vector of replacement values by repeating the statistic for a column `N` times, where `N` is the number of missing values in that column.
    *   **Column 0 replacement**: 5.80707965
    *   **Column 1 replacement**: 3.07211538
    *   **Column 2 replacement**: 3.75545455
    *   **Column 3 replacement**: 1.19722222
5.  **Data Modification**: The specific `NaN` entries in `X` are replaced with the corresponding column means:
    *   Row 3, Col 1 becomes `3.07211538`
    *   Row 5, Col 0 becomes `5.80707965`; Col 1 becomes `3.07211538`
    *   Row 7, Col 2 becomes `3.75545455`
    *   Row 13, Col 2 becomes `3.75545455`; Col 3 becomes `1.19722222`
    *   Row 16, Col 3 becomes `1.19722222`
    *   Row 17, Col 3 becomes `1.19722222`
    *   Row 19, Col 2 becomes `3.75545455`
    *   Row 20, Col 3 becomes `1.19722222`
    *   Row 24, Col 1 becomes `3.07211538`
    *   Row 25, Col 0 becomes `5.80707965`
    *   Row 26, Col 2 becomes `3.75545455`
    *   Row 29, Col 0 becomes `5.80707965`
6.  **Indicator**: Since `add_indicator` is `False`, no indicator columns are appended. The method returns the imputed matrix `X`.
