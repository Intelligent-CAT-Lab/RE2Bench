The function `match_submerged_margins` is designed to synchronize margins for axes that span multiple columns or rows in a `constrained_layout`.

1.  **Initialize `axs`**: The function starts by collecting axes from the figure (`fig.get_axes()`).
    *   The input `fig` is described as `<Figure size 1000x500 with 2 Axes>`. This implies `fig.get_axes()` returns a list containing 2 Axes objects.
    *   The function filters these axes. It checks `a.get_subplotspec() is not None`, `a.get_in_layout()`, and `a not in axsdone`.
    *   Assuming standard behavior for a figure with a `GridSpec`, the axes have subplotspecs and obey layout. `axsdone` is empty as there are no subfigures provided in the input.

2.  **Filter by `layoutgrids`**: The loop iterates through `axs`.
    *   It retrieves the gridspec for each axis: `ss1.get_gridspec()`.
    *   It checks if this gridspec is a key in `layoutgrids`.
    *   The `layoutgrids` input contains `"GridSpec(1, 2)"`. For a figure with 2 axes arranged in a standard way (implied by the count and 1x2 spec), both axes belong to this gridspec. Thus, they are retained in `axs`.

3.  **Check for Spanning (Submerged Margins)**:
    *   The grid is `GridSpec(1, 2)`, meaning 1 row and 2 columns.
    *   With 2 axes occupying this grid, the standard layout is one axis per cell:
        *   Axis 1: `row=0`, `col=0`. `colspan` is `range(0, 1)`, length 1.
        *   Axis 2: `row=0`, `col=1`. `colspan` is `range(1, 2)`, length 1.
    *   The code checks `if len(ss1.colspan) > 1:` and `if len(ss1.rowspan) > 1:`.
    *   Since both axes have a span of 1 (they do not span multiple columns or rows), these conditions are `False`.
    *   Consequently, the logic to calculate `maxsubl`, `maxsubr`, etc., and call `lg1.edit_margin_min` is skipped for both axes.

4.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns `axs`.
    *   The list `axs` contains the 2 Axes objects originally found in the figure, unmodified.

The output will be the list of axes. As we are predicting output values based on string representations in the input, we represent the axes with their standard string representation for subplots.
