The function `_get_kernel_params` constructs a dictionary of parameters to be passed to the kernel function.
1.  It starts by checking `self.kernel_params`. Since `self.kernel_params` is `None`, `params` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.
2.  The code checks if `self.kernel` is callable or 'precomputed'. `self.kernel` is `'polynomial'`, so the condition `not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed'` is true.
3.  It iterates over parameter names defined in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`. For `'polynomial'`, the standard parameters in scikit-learn are `['gamma', 'degree', 'coef0']`.
4.  For iteration `param = 'gamma'`: `self.gamma` is `None` (from input), so it is skipped.
5.  For iteration `param = 'degree'`: `self.degree` is `3.1`. Since it is not None, `params['degree'] = 3.1`.
6.  For iteration `param = 'coef0'`: `self.coef0` is `0.1`. Since it is not None, `params['coef0'] = 0.1`.
7.  The loop finishes. The `elif` block is skipped because the `if` block was entered.
8.  The function returns `params`, which is `{ 'degree': 3.1, 'coef0': 0.1 }`.
