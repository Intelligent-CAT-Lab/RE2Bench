The function `diophantine` attempts to solve the Diophantine equation $8xy + z^2 = 0$.

1.  **Parsing and Classification**:
    The input equation is `eq = 8*x*y + z**2`.
    The variables are identified as `x, y, z`.
    `classify_diop(eq)` is called.
    *   The polynomial is homogeneous of degree 2.
    *   Coefficients are extracted: `{x*y: 8, z**2: 1}`.
    *   Terms like $x^2$ and $y^2$ are missing.
    *   The diagonal condition fails (presence of interaction term $x*y$).
    *   It is identified as `'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'`.

2.  **Solving**:
    `diophantine` calls `diop_solve`.
    Inside `diop_solve`, since the type is `homogeneous_ternary_quadratic`, it calls `_diop_ternary_quadratic` to find a base solution and then `_parametrize_ternary_quadratic`.
    *   **Base Point**: The solver looks for a small integer solution $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.
        *   Testing small values:
        *   $(1, 0, 0) \implies 8(1)(0) + 0^2 = 0$. This is a valid non-trivial solution. It is likely the first one found (smallest norm).
        *   $(0, 1, 0) \implies 8(0)(1) + 0^2 = 0$. Also valid.
        *   $(1, -2, 4) \implies 8(1)(-2) + 16 = -16+16=0$. Valid but larger.
    *   **Parametrization**:
        Using the projection method from the point $(1, 0, 0)$.
        The line through $(1, 0, 0)$ can be parameterized as $x = 1 + pt$, $y = qt$, $z = rt$. (Using parameters $p, q$ effectively, though derivation uses $t$).
        Substitute into $8xy + z^2 = 0$:
        $8(1+pt)(qt) + (rt)^2 = 0$
        $8qt + 8pqt^2 + r^2t^2 = 0$
        Divide by $t$ (non-zero solution):
        $8q + t(8pq + r^2) = 0 \implies t = \frac{-8q}{8pq + r^2}$.
        Substitute $t$ back into line equations (ignoring denominator for homogeneous solution):
        $x \propto 1(8pq+r^2) + p(-8q) = 8pq + r^2 - 8pq = r^2$
        $y \propto q(-8q) = -8q^2$
        $z \propto r(-8q) = -8qr$
        
        Using standard symbols `p` and `q` for the parameters (mapping $r \to p$, $q \to q$):
        Solution vector: $(p^2, -8q^2, -8pq)$.
        
        SymPy typically simplifies signs or arbitrary parameter directions. The term $8pq$ is often presented with a positive sign if it's a cross term, or maintained. Standard output for similar structures (like Pythagorean triples) uses positive cross terms if possible, but here it's a direct geometric map. However, usually SymPy returns `8*p*q`.
        
        Checking the solution $(p^2, -8q^2, 8pq)$:
        $8(p^2)(-8q^2) + (8pq)^2 = -64p^2q^2 + 64p^2q^2 = 0$. This is correct.
        
        The variables are sorted `[x, y, z]`. The tuple corresponds to this order.
        So the tuple is `(p**2, -8*q**2, 8*p*q)`.

3.  **Final Output**:
    The result is returned as a set of tuples. Since `permute` is False, only the base parametrization is returned.
    Output: `{(p**2, -8*q**2, 8*p*q)}`.
