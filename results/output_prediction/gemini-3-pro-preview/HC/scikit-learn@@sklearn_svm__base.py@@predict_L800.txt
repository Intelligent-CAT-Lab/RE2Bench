Based on a step-by-step simulation of the Support Vector Machine (SVC) prediction logic using the provided parameters (Support Vectors, Dual Coefficients, Intercepts, Gamma):

1.  **Model Structure**: The SVC is a multi-class model with 3 classes (0, 1, 2). It uses a "one-vs-one" scheme internally, meaning 3 binary classifiers are evaluated: (0 vs 1), (0 vs 2), and (1 vs 2). The final class is determined by a voting mechanism.
2.  **Kernel**: RBF Kernel $K(x, y) = \exp(-\gamma ||x - y||^2)$ with $\gamma \approx 1.75$.
3.  **Data Analysis**:
    *   Class 0 Support Vectors are clustered in the range [0.1, 0.6].
    *   Class 1 Support Vectors are in the range [1.0, 1.8].
    *   Class 2 Support Vectors are in the range [1.4, 2.5].
4.  **Decision Boundaries (Approximate)**:
    *   **Class 0 vs Class 1**: The boundary is roughly equidistant between the clusters (around 0.8). Points $< 0.8$ are Class 0.
    *   **Class 1 vs Class 2**: This is the critical overlapping region. Calculations for specific points (1.4, 1.5) indicate a boundary switch around 1.45.
        *   Points at 1.4 evaluate to Class 1.
        *   Points at 1.5 evaluate to Class 2.
    *   **Class 0 vs Class 2**: Class 2 is far from Class 0. Points $> 1.0$ favor Class 2 over Class 0.
5.  **Predictions for Input X**:
    *   Points like **0.2, 0.3, 0.4**: Close to Class 0 SVs. Prediction: **0**.
    *   Points like **1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4**: Close to Class 1 SVs, and below the 1 vs 2 boundary. Prediction: **1**.
    *   Points like **1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4**: Closer to Class 2 SVs or on the Class 2 side of the 1v2 boundary. Prediction: **2**.
