The output of the function `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` is a tuple containing `(x_weights, y_weights, ite)`.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Context**: The function implements the NIPALS (Non-linear Iterative Partial Least Squares) inner loop to find the first component weights for X and Y matrices.
2.  **Input Parsing**:
    *   `X` is a 4x3 centered matrix.
    *   `Y` is a 4x2 centered matrix.
    *   `tol` is 1e-06.
    *   `norm_y_weights` is True.
3.  **Simulation - Iteration 1**:
    *   Initialize `y_score` with the first column of Y.
    *   Calculate `x_weights` by projecting `y_score` onto `X`. The covariance vector (column 0 of $X^T Y$) is approximately proportional to `[2.88, 2.98, 2.86]`. Normalized `x_weights` $\approx [0.5727, 0.5916, 0.5675]$.
    *   Calculate `x_score` from `X @ x_weights`.
    *   Calculate `y_weights` from projecting `x_score` onto `Y`. The columns of $X^T Y$ have norms $5.039$ and $5.051$ respectively, suggesting the second column of Y has slightly more "weight" in the shared subspace. `y_weights` (unnormalized) reflect this. Normalized `y_weights` $\approx [0.7068, 0.7075]$.
    *   Update `y_score`.
    *   **Convergence Check**: Compare current `x_weights` with old (0). Difference is large. `ite` becomes 2.
4.  **Simulation - Iteration 2**:
    *   New `y_score` combines columns of Y defined by `y_weights`.
    *   Calculate `x_weights` again. This effectively finds the first singular vector of the covariance matrix $C = X^T Y$. The resulting `x_weights` converge extremely quickly because the starting point (Col 0) was already very close to the dominant eigenvector of $C C^T$.
    *   New `x_weights` $\approx [0.5726, 0.5915, 0.5674]$.
    *   **Convergence Check**: Calculate squared difference between `x_weights` (Iter 2) and `x_weights` (Iter 1). The difference is in the order of $10^{-4}$, squared difference $\approx 10^{-8}$.
    *   Since $10^{-8} < 10^{-6}$ (`tol`), the loop breaks.
    *   The function returns the values from Iteration 2.

**Calculation of approximate values (SVD of $X^T Y$):**
*   `x_weights` (U vector): `[0.572620, 0.591539, 0.567406]`
*   `y_weights` (V vector): `[0.706752, 0.707461]`
*   `ite`: 2
