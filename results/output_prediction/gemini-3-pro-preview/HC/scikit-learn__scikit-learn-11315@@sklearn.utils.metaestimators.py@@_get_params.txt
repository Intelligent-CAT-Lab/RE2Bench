[THOUGHT]
The function `_get_params` is executed with `attr="_transformers"` and `deep=False`.

1.  **Call to `super().get_params(deep=deep)`:**
    The code calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=False)`. This refers to `BaseEstimator.get_params`.
    `BaseEstimator.get_params` inspects the object to find parameters defined in `__init__`. While the `__init__` code isn't explicitly provided for the specific class of `self`, the attributes in the `self` dictionary (`transformers`, `remainder`, `n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`) and the target [STRUCTURE] indicate these are the relevant parameters.
    It retrieves the values for these parameters from `self`:
    *   `n_jobs`: derived from `self.n_jobs`, which is `1`.
    *   `remainder`: derived from `self.remainder`, which is `"passthrough"`.
    *   `transformer_weights`: derived from `self.transformer_weights`, which is `null` (None).
    *   `transformers`: derived from `self.transformers`, which is `null` (None).
    
    The resulting dictionary `out` contains these key-value pairs.

2.  **`deep` check:**
    The code checks `if not deep:`. Since `deep` is `False`, this condition is true. The function immediately returns `out`.

3.  **Skipped Logic:**
    The subsequent logic involving `getattr(self, attr)` (which would access `_transformers`) and iterating over nested estimators is skipped because `deep` is False.

4.  **Final Output:**
    The function returns the dictionary representing the shallow parameters.
