The `transform` method of `NMF` computes the matrix `W` (loading matrix) such that `W @ H \approx X`, where `H` is the fixed components matrix stored in `self.components_` and `X` is the input data, by minimizing the Frobenius norm subject to non-negativity constraints on `W` (Non-negative Least Squares).
