1.  **Initialize Parameters**:
    *   `Gram` is a 12x12 matrix. Looking at the diagonal elements (e.g., `Gram[0][0]`, `Gram[1][1]`), they are all `1.0`.
    *   `Xy` is a vector of shape (12, 1).
    *   `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1.
    *   `tol` is `None` (so tolerance check is skipped).
    *   `norms_squared` is provided but likely unused because `tol` is `None`.
    *   We enter `orthogonal_mp_gram`. `Xy` is converted to a numpy array. `coef` is initialized as a zeros array of shape (12, 1).

2.  **Loop Execution**:
    *   The code iterates `k` over `range(Xy.shape[1])` which is `range(1)`.
    *   It calls `_gram_omp(Gram, Xy[:, 0], n_nonzero_coefs=1, ...)`

3.  **Inside `_gram_omp`**:
    *   `alpha` is initialized to `Xy` (the input vector).
    *   `max_features` is 1.
    *   **Iteration 1**:
        *   `lam = np.argmax(np.abs(alpha))`. The values in `Xy` are:
            0. `0.88986487`
            1. `2.33249979`  <-- Maximum absolute value
            2. `0.13957277`
            3. `0.21592705`
            4. `-0.48258954`
            5. `-0.207901`
            6. `-0.74100454`
            7. `0.06184457`
            8. `-0.82782566`
            9. `-1.68362053`
            10. `0.0210131`
            11. `1.53638069`
        *   The maximum is at index 1 (`lam = 1`).
        *   `Gram[lam, lam]` is `1.0`. `L[0, 0] = sqrt(1.0) = 1.0`.
        *   The algorithms swaps index 0 and index 1 in `Gram` and `Xy`. `indices` becomes `[1, 0, 2, ...]`.
        *   `gamma` is computed by solving the triangular system. Since `L` is identity (1x1), `gamma` = transformed `Xy[0]` (which is original `Xy[1]`) = `2.33249979`.
        *   `n_active` becomes 1.
        *   Condition `n_active == max_features` (1 == 1) is met. Loop breaks.
    *   Returns `gamma` (2.33249979) and `indices` (first element is 1).

4.  **Back in `orthogonal_mp_gram`**:
    *   `coef` is updated. `coef[1, 0] = 2.33249979`.
    *   The loop finishes.
    *   The function returns `np.squeeze(coef)`. This flattens the (12, 1) array to (12,).

5.  **Result Construction**:
    *   The output is a 1D array of length 12.
    *   The element at index 1 is `2.33249979`.
    *   All other elements are `0.0`.
