[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `add_event` method in the `CalendarUtil` class.

1.  **Input Analysis**:
    *   The `self` object is initialized with a list `events` containing one item (a dictionary for a "New Year" event).
    *   The method `add_event` is called with an argument `event`, which is another dictionary (identical to the one already in the list).

2.  **Code Execution**:
    *   The method definition is:
        ```python
        def add_event(self, event):
            self.events.append(event)
        ```
    *   This method appends the `event` argument to the `self.events` list.
    *   It does **not** return anything explicitly. In Python, if a function or method doesn't have a `return` statement, it returns `None`.

3.  **Result**:
    *   The `events` list inside the object is modified, but the return value of the function call itself is `None` (or `null` in JSON representation).

4.  **Final Output Formulation**:
    *   The structure requires `{"output": XXX}`.
    *   Since the method returns `None`, `XXX` should be `null`.
