[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums`, an integer index `idx`, and an element `added` to be inserted into the list.

The line `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` is a specific Python idiom for inserting elements into a list at a specific index. 
- `nums[idx:idx]` specifies a slice of the list starting and ending at `idx`. Because the start and end indices are the same, this slice is empty, positioned exactly at index `idx` (before the element currently at that index).
- Assigning an iterable (like the tuple `(added,)`) to this slice effectively inserts the contents of that iterable into the list at that position.

Let's trace the execution with the provided inputs:
- `nums`: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
- `idx`: `2`
- `added`: `3`

1.  We target index `2`. The elements currently are:
    Index 0: 2
    Index 1: 2
    Index 2: 3 (This is the insertion point)
    Index 3: 2
    ...

2.  The code `nums[2:2] = (3,)` inserts the value `3` right before the element currently at index 2.

3.  The list modification happens in-place:
    - Original: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
    - Insert `3` at index 2.
    - New list: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`

4.  The function returns the modified `nums` list.

The resulting list is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.
