Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The inputs are provided as a single string `"3447 629"`.
2.  `input().split()` reads this string and splits it by whitespace, resulting in a list: `['3447', '629']`.
3.  `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers.
    *   `h` becomes `3447`.
    *   `a` becomes `629`.
4.  `h / a` performs floating-point division: `3447 / 629`.
    *   Let's calculate: `3447 / 629`.
    *   `629 * 5 = 3145`.
    *   `3447 - 3145 = 302`.
    *   So, the value is approximately `5.48...`.
5.  `math.ceil(h / a)` computes the ceiling of this result. The ceiling of `5.48...` is `6`.
6.  The program prints `6`.
