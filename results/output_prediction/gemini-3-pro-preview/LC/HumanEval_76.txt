[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of the function `is_simple_power` with the arguments provided: `x = 1` and `n = 1`.

1.  **Function Call:** `is_simple_power(x=1, n=1)`
2.  **Initial Check:** The first block of code is:
    ```python
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1
    ```
3.  **Condition Evaluation:** We check the condition `n == 1`. Since the input `n` is indeed 1, this condition evaluates to `True`.
4.  **Return Statement:** The code enters the `if` block and executes `return x == 1`.
5.  **Result Calculation:** We check if `x == 1`. Since the input `x` is 1, this evaluates to `True`.
6.  **Function Return:** The function returns `True`.

The rest of the code (the `while` loop) is skipped because the function has already returned.
