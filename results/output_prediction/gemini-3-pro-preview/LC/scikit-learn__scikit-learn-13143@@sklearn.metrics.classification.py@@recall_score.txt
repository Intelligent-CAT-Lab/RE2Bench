To predict the output of the `recall_score` function with the provided inputs, we simulate the execution step by step.

1.  **Function Invocation**: `recall_score` is called using arguments derived from the JSON input:
    *   `y_true` is `None` (from `null`).
    *   `y_pred` is `None` (from `null`).
    *   `labels` is `None`.
    *   `average` is `None`.

    The call is effectively `recall_score(y_true=None, y_pred=None, labels=None, average=None)`.

2.  **Inside `recall_score`**:
    It delegates to `precision_recall_fscore_support`:
    ```python
    precision_recall_fscore_support(None, None, labels=None, pos_label=1, average=None, warn_for=('recall',), sample_weight=None)
    ```

3.  **Inside `precision_recall_fscore_support`**:
    *   Parameter check: `average=None` is in `average_options`. Check passes.
    *   Target check: `_check_targets(None, None)` is called.

4.  **Inside `_check_targets`**:
    *   `check_consistent_length(None, None)` is called.
        *   Inside `check_consistent_length`, `_num_samples` is called only for arguments that are not `None`. Since both are `None`, the list of lengths is empty `[]`. `uniques` is empty. The consistency check passes effectively doing nothing.
    *   `type_true = type_of_target(y_true)` is called with `y_true=None`.

5.  **Inside `type_of_target`** (with `y=None`):
    *   The validity check is:
        ```python
        valid = (isinstance(y, (Sequence, spmatrix)) or hasattr(y, '__array__')) and (not isinstance(y, str))
        ```
    *   `None` is not an instance of `Sequence`.
    *   `None` is not a `spmatrix`.
    *   `None` does not have `__array__`.
    *   Therefore, `valid` is `False`.
    *   The function raises `ValueError`:
        ```python
        raise ValueError('Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r' % y)
        ```
    *   The formatted message is: `"Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got None"`.

6.  **Conclusion**:
    The execution is halted by a `ValueError` inside `type_of_target`.
