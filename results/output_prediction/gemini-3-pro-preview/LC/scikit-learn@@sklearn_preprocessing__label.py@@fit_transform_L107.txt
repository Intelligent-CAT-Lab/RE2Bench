[THOUGHT]
The function `fit_transform` of `LabelEncoder` is called with a numpy array `y` consisting of 0s and 1s.
1.  `column_or_1d(y)` is called to normalize the input shape. Since `y` is already a 1D array of integers, it remains a 1D array.
2.  `_unique(y, return_inverse=True)` is called. This function finds the unique values in `y`, sorts them, and computes the indices (inverse transform) that reconstruct `y` from the unique values.
3.  The unique values in `y` are `0` and `1`. Sorted, they are `[0, 1]`.
4.  The inverse transform maps each element in `y` to its index in the unique values array `[0, 1]`.
    *   The value `0` is at index `0`.
    *   The value `1` is at index `1`.
5.  Consequently, every `0` in the input becomes `0` in the output, and every `1` becomes `1`. The transformation is an identity mapping in this specific case.
6.  The method returns the transformed array (the inverse indices).
7.  Since the resulting array is identical to the input array, the output string representation will match the input string representation exactly.

The input variable `y` is provided as a string representation of a numpy array: `"array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,\n       0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])"`.
The corresponding output will be this exact string.
