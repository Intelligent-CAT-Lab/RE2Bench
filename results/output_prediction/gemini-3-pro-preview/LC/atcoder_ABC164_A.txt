Let's execute the code step by step using the provided input.

1.  **Input Reading:** The program reads a single line of input `"74 74"`.
2.  **Splitting and Mapping:** The `input().split()` splits the string `"74 74"` into a list `['74', '74']`. The `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers.
    *   `S` becomes `74`.
    *   `W` becomes `74`.
3.  **Conditional Check:** The code executes the ternary operator logic: `print('unsafe') if S <= W else print('safe')`.
    *   The condition is `S <= W`, which translates to `74 <= 74`.
    *   Is `74` less than or equal to `74`? Yes, it is equal. The condition is **True**.
4.  **Execution:** Since the condition is True, the code executes the left side: `print('unsafe')`.
5.  **Output:** The string `unsafe` is printed to standard output.
