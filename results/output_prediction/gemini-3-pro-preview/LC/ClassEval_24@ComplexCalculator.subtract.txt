[THOUGHT]
The user wants to find the result of subtracting two complex numbers using the provided static method `ComplexCalculator.subtract`.

1.  **Parse Inputs**: The input provides two strings representing complex numbers: `c1` is `"(-1+2j)"` and `c2` is `"(-3+4j)"`. In Python, `complex("string")` converts these strings into complex number objects.
    *   `c1` becomes the complex number `-1 + 2j`.
    *   `c2` becomes the complex number `-3 + 4j`.

2.  **Execute `subtract` method**: The method calculates the difference between the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.
    *   **Real Part Calculation**: `c1.real - c2.real`
        *   `real = -1 - (-3)`
        *   `real = -1 + 3`
        *   `real = 2.0`
    *   **Imaginary Part Calculation**: `c1.imag - c2.imag`
        *   `imaginary = 2 - 4`
        *   `imaginary = -2.0`

3.  **Construct Result**: The method returns a new complex object `complex(real, imaginary)`.
    *   Result: `complex(2.0, -2.0)`
    *   String representation in Python: `(2-2j)`

4.  **Format Output**: The final output needs to match the structure provided, replacing `XXX` with the string representation of the result.
