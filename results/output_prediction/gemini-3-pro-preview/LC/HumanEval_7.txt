[THOUGHT]
The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings (`strings`) and a target substring (`substring`). Its purpose is to return a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the target substring.

Let's trace the execution with the provided inputs:
1.  **Input arguments:**
    *   `strings`: `['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome']`
    *   `substring`: `'run'`

2.  **Step-by-step iteration:**
    *   **Item 1: `'grunt'`**: Does `'run'` exist in `'grunt'`? Yes, it is in the middle (g**run**t). So, `'grunt'` is kept.
    *   **Item 2: `'trumpet'`**: Does `'run'` exist in `'trumpet'`? No. It is discarded.
    *   **Item 3: `'prune'`**: Does `'run'` exist in `'prune'`? Yes, it is in the middle (p**run**e). So, `'prune'` is kept.
    *   **Item 4: `'gruesome'`**: Does `'run'` exist in `'gruesome'`? No (it has 'ru' but not 'run'). It is discarded.

3.  **Result:** The list comprehension `[x for x in strings if substring in x]` collects the matching items: `['grunt', 'prune']`.

4.  **Return:** The function returns `['grunt', 'prune']`.
