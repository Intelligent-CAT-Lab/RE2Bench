To determine the output of the function `truncate_number`, let's trace the execution:

[THOUGHT]
1. **Analyze the input:** The function `truncate_number` is called with the argument `number = 1.33`.
2. **Analyze the function:** The function code is:
   ```python
   def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
       return number % 1.0
   ```
   It performs a modulo operation with `1.0`.
3. **Execute the operation:** The calculation is `1.33 % 1.0`.
   - The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division.
   - Using floating-point arithmetic, `1.33` divided by `1.0` is `1` with a remainder of `0.33`.
   - Mathematically, `1.33 = 1 * 1.0 + 0.33`.
4. **Rounding considerations:** Floating-point arithmetic can sometimes lead to precision issues (e.g., getting `0.33000000000000007`), but for standard JSON output representation in this context, the value is effectively `0.33`. Python's standard float representation usually handles simple decimals like this reasonably cleanly for display, though strictly speaking, the internal binary representation might act slightly differently. Let's calculate typical Python output: `1.33 % 1.0` evaluates to approximately `0.33`.
5. **Determine the output:** The return value is `0.33`.
