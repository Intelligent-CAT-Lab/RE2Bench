[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the method `generate_email_pattern` in the `RegexUtils` class.

1.  **Analyze the Code:**
    *   The class `RegexUtils` has a method `generate_email_pattern`.
    *   The method takes `self` as an argument but doesn't use it.
    *   Inside the method, a string variable `pattern` is defined: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
        *   Note the double backslashes `\\`. In Python string literals, `\\` escapes to a single backslash `\`.
        *   So the actual string value in memory will be: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`.
    *   The method returns this `pattern` string.
    *   The method does not take any arguments other than `self`.

2.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   `self`: Empty dict `{}`. This is fine, the method doesn't use instance state.
    *   `args`: Empty `{}`.
    *   `kwargs`: Empty `{}`.

3.  **Simulation:**
    *   Call `RegexUtils().generate_email_pattern()`.
    *   The variable `pattern` is assigned the string literal `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
    *   The return value is that string.

4.  **Formatting the Output:**
    *   The logic is straightforward. However, representation in JSON is tricky with backslashes.
    *   The Python string is: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
    *   When writing this string into a JSON value (which is surrounded by double quotes), backslashes must be escaped.
    *   So, a single backslash in the string becomes `\\` in the JSON representation.
    *   The output placeholder XXX needs to be filled with the JSON representation of the return string.

    Let's look closer at the Python string literal provided in the source code:
    `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`
    
    When Python evaluates this literal:
    `\\b` becomes `\b` (backslash b)
    `\\.` becomes `\.` (backslash dot)
    `\\b` becomes `\b` (backslash b)

    So the resulting Python string object contains: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`

    Now, I need to format this for the JSON output.
    JSON string: "..."
    Inside the JSON string, backslashes must be escaped.
    So `\` becomes `\\`.
    
    The output string to be placed in the JSON structure is: `"\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"`

    "output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
