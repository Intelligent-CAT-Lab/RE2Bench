Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call:** `f(text="g", n=15)`
2.  **Check Condition:** `if len(text) <= 2:`
    *   `len("g")` is 1.
    *   The condition `1 <= 2` is **True**.
3.  **Return Statement:** Since the condition is true, the function immediately executes `return text`.
4.  **Result:** The function returns the original string `"g"`.

[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is called with `text="g"` and `n=15`.
First, it checks if the length of `text` is less than or equal to 2.
`len("g")` is 1, which is indeed less than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the function enters the `if` block and returns `text` immediately.
The subsequent lines involving `leading_chars` calculation are skipped.
The return value is simply "g".
