[THOUGHT]
The function `_convert_type_spec` takes a type string `_type` and a dictionary of translations.
In this case:
1. `_type` is "str".
2. `translations` is `{}` (empty dict).

Execution steps:
1. `if _type in translations:` -> "str" is not in {}. This block is skipped.
2. `elif _type == 'None':` -> "str" is not equal to 'None'. This block is skipped.
3. `else:` -> The code enters this block.
4. `return ':class:`%s`' % _type` -> format string ':class:`%s`' with "str".
   The result is `':class:`str`'`.
