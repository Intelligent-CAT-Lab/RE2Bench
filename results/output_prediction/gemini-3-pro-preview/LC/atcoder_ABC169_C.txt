Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **`a, b = input().split()`**: The input string `"776013196293085 2.60"` is split by whitespace.
    *   `a` becomes `'776013196293085'`
    *   `b` becomes `'2.60'`

2.  **`b = b[0] + b[2:]`**: This manipulates the string `b`.
    *   `b[0]` is the first character: `'2'`.
    *   `b[2:]` is the substring starting from index 2 to the end: `'60'`.
    *   Concatenating them: `'2' + '60'` results in `'260'`. Essentially, this removes the decimal point (assuming the decimal point is at index 1).

3.  **`a = int(a)`**: Converts string `a` to an integer.
    *   `a` becomes `776013196293085`.

4.  **`b = int(b)`**: Converts string `b` to an integer.
    *   `b` becomes `260`.

5.  **`print(a * b // 100)`**: Calculates the result.
    *   First, `a * b` is calculated: `776013196293085 * 260`.
        *   Calculation check: `776013196293085 * 260 = 201763431036202100` (roughly 7.76e14 * 2.6e2 = 20e16).
        *   Let's do a simpler check. `776... * 2.6 * 100` essentially.
    *   Then, integer division `// 100`. This effectively removes the last two digits of the product.
    *   Let's look at the logic. `b` was originally effectively `2.60`. By removing the dot, it became `260`. This is `2.60 * 100`.
    *   The calculation is `a * (b_original * 100) // 100`. This simplifies to `a * b_original` (truncated to integer).
    *   Let's do the exact math:
        `776013196293085 * 260 = 201763431036202100`
    *   `201763431036202100 // 100 = 2017634310362021`
