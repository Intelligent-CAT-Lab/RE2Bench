[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of the `extract_all` method with the provided inputs.

1.  **Initialization**: An instance of `ZipFileProcessor` is created with `self.file_name = ""`.
2.  **Method Call**: The `extract_all` method is called with `output_path = ""`.
3.  **Try Block Execution**:
    *   The code enters the `try` block.
    *   It attempts to open a zip file: `with zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r') as zip_file:`.
    *   Here, `self.file_name` is `""` (an empty string).
    *   Passing an empty string as a filename to `zipfile.ZipFile` (or the underlying `open` call) usually results in an error. Specifically, it will likely raise a `FileNotFoundError` (or `IOError` depending on the OS/Python version) because a file with an empty name simply cannot be found or opened.
4.  **Exception Handling**:
    *   The `with` statement raises an exception.
    *   The flow of control jumps to the `except` block: `except:`.
    *   This is a bare `except`, catching all standard exceptions.
5.  **Return Value**:
    *   Inside the `except` block, the function executes `return False`.

Therefore, the function will return `False`.
