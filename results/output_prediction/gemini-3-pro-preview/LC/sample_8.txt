Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Analysis**: The function `f` is called with arguments `string = "UppEr"` and `encryption = 0`.
2.  **Logic Execution**:
    *   The function checks `if encryption == 0:`.
    *   Since the input `encryption` is `0`, this condition evaluates to `True`.
3.  **Branch Execution**: The code enters the `if` block.
    *   It executes `return string`.
4.  **Result**: The value of `string` is returned directly without modification. The value is "UppEr".
