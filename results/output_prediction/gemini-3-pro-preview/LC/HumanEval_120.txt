Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Analyze the input:** The function `maximum` is called with `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`.
2.  **Check base case:** The code checks `if k == 0`. Here `k` is 2, so this condition is false.
3.  **Sort the array:** `arr.sort()` sorts the list in place in ascending order.
    The list `[-4, 4]` is already sorted. So `arr` remains `[-4, 4]`.
4.  **Slice the array:** `ans = arr[-k:]`.
    Since `k` is 2, this is `arr[-2:]`.
    In Python slicing, a negative index `-N` means "start N elements from the end". So `arr[-2:]` takes the last 2 elements of the list.
    The list `arr` has only 2 elements. Taking the last 2 elements results in the entire list: `[-4, 4]`.
5.  **Return:** The function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.
