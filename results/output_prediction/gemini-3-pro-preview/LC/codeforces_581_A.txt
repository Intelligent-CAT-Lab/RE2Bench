[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the python code step by step with the given input.

1.  **Input Reading**:
    `x = list(input().split())`
    The input provided is the string `"1 1"`.
    The `split()` method splits this string by whitespace.
    `x` becomes `['1', '1']`.

2.  **Conversion to Integers**:
    The loop `for i in range(len(x)):` iterates through the list.
    - `i=0`: `x[0] = int('1')` -> `x` becomes `[1, '1']`
    - `i=1`: `x[1] = int('1')` -> `x` becomes `[1, 1]`
    So, `x` is `[1, 1]`.

3.  **Variable Assignment**:
    `a = x[0]` -> `a` is `1`.
    `b = x[1]` -> `b` is `1`.

4.  **First Print Statement**:
    `print(min(x), end=' ')`
    `min([1, 1])` is `1`.
    The code prints `1` followed by a space. Output so far: `"1 "`.

5.  **Conditional Logic**:
    `if abs(a - b) >= 2:`
    Calculate `abs(a - b)`: `abs(1 - 1)` which is `0`.
    Check condition: `0 >= 2` is `False`.

6.  **Else Block**:
    Since the condition is false, the code goes to the `else:` block.
    `print(0)`
    This prints `0` immediately after the previous output (which ended with a space).

7.  **Final Output**:
    The sequence printed is `1` (from the first print) + ` ` + `0` (from the second print).
    Result: `"1 0"`
