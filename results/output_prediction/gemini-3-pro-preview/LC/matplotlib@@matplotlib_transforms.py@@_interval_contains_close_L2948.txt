The user wants me to simulate the execution of the function `_interval_contains_close` with the provided inputs.

**Input Analysis:**
- `interval`: `[0.001, 1.0]`
- `val`: `0.2`
- `rtol`: `1e-10`

**Step-by-step Execution:**

1.  **Function Call:** `_interval_contains_close([0.001, 1.0], 0.2, rtol=1e-10)`

2.  **Line `a, b = interval`:**
    - `a` becomes `0.001`
    - `b` becomes `1.0`

3.  **Line `if a > b:`**
    - `0.001 > 1.0` is `False`. The swap block is skipped.

4.  **Line `rtol = (b - a) * rtol`:**
    - `b - a` = `1.0 - 0.001` = `0.999`
    - `rtol` = `0.999 * 1e-10` = `9.99e-11`

5.  **Line `return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol`:**
    - Lower bound calculation: `a - rtol` = `0.001 - 9.99e-11` = `0.0009999999001` (approximately)
    - Upper bound calculation: `b + rtol` = `1.0 + 9.99e-11` = `1.0000000000999` (approximately)
    - Comparison: `0.00099999... <= 0.2 <= 1.000000...`
    - `0.2` is indeed greater than `0.000999...` and less than `1.0...`.

6.  **Result:** The expression evaluates to `True`.
