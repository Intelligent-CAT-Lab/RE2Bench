Let's analyze the execution flow for the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class.

1.  **Initialization**: An instance of `SQLGenerator` is created with `table_name="table1"`. So, `self.table_name` is `"table1"`.

2.  **Method Call**: The `select` method is called.
    *   `args` is empty.
    *   `kwargs` contains `condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
    *   The `fields` argument is not provided, so it defaults to `None`.

3.  **Execution of `select`**:
    *   **Check `fields`**: `fields` is `None`.
        *   The code enters the `if fields is None:` block.
        *   `fields` is set to `'*'`.
    *   **Construct SQL start**:
        *   `sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}'`
        *   Substituting values: `f'SELECT * FROM table1'`
        *   `sql` becomes `"SELECT * FROM table1"`.
    *   **Check `condition`**:
        *   `condition` is passed as `"age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
        *   It is not `None`.
        *   The code enters the `if condition is not None:` block.
        *   `sql += f' WHERE {condition}'`
        *   `sql` becomes `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`.
    *   **Return**:
        *   `return sql + ';'`
        *   The final string is `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"`.

4.  **Final Output**: The function returns the generated SQL string.
