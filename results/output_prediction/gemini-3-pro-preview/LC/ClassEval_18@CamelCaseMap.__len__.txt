[THOUGHT]
The user wants to find the output of the `__len__` method for an instance of `CamelCaseMap`.

1.  **Initialize the object**: The input shows that `self._data` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
2.  **Execute `__len__`**: The method simply returns `len(self._data)`.
3.  **Calculate length**: `self._data` is `{}`, which has 0 items.
4.  **Result**: The length is 0.
