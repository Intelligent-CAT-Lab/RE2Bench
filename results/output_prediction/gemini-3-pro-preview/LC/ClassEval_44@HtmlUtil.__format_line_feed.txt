[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the static method `__format_line_feed` within the `HtmlUtil` class.

1.  **Input Analysis**:
    - The input text provided in `args` is: `"Some sentence here."`
    - The method `__format_line_feed` takes this text as input.

2.  **Code Execution Simulation**:
    - The method is defined as:
      ```python
      @staticmethod
      def __format_line_feed(text):
          return re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text)
      ```
    - The regex pattern is `\\n+`, which matches one or more newline characters.
    - The replacement string is `\n` (a single newline character).
    - The function effectively collapses multiple consecutive newlines into a single newline.

3.  **Applying to Input**:
    - Input string: `"Some sentence here."`
    - Does this string contain any newline characters (`\n`)? No.
    - Since there are no occurrences of the pattern `\n+`, the `re.sub` function will return the original string unchanged.

4.  **Final Result Formulation**:
    - The output will be identical to the input string.
