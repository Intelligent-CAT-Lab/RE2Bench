[THOUGHT]
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input.
1.  The input string provided is `"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY"`.
2.  The function first calls `.lower()` on the string. This converts all characters to lowercase.
    *   "Jerry" becomes "jerry"
    *   "jERRY" becomes "jerry"
    *   "JeRRRY" becomes "jerrry"
    *   The spaces remain spaces.
    *   So, `string.lower()` results in `"jerry jerry jerrry"`.
3.  Next, `set(...)` is called on this lowercased string. A set collects only the unique characters present in the string.
    *   The characters in `"jerry jerry jerrry"` are: 'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', ' ' (space).
    *   Let's list them out:
        *   'j' is present.
        *   'e' is present.
        *   'r' is present.
        *   'y' is present.
        *   ' ' (space) is present.
    *   The set will contain `{'j', 'e', 'r', 'y', ' '}`.
4.  Finally, `len(...)` is called on the set to count the number of unique elements.
    *   There are 5 unique characters: j, e, r, y, and space.
5.  The function returns 5.
