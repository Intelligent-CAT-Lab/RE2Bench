[THOUGHT]
The function `split` uses the `re.split` method from Python's standard `re` library.
1.  **Pattern**: `\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b`. This regex matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX. Specifically:
    *   `\b`: Word boundary
    *   `\d{3}`: Three digits
    *   `-`: A hyphen
    *   `\d{3}`: Three digits
    *   `-`: A hyphen
    *   `\d{4}`: Four digits
    *   `\b`: Word boundary
2.  **Text**: `"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`
3.  **Execution**: `re.split` splits the string at every occurrence of the pattern.
    *   **First match**: `123-456-7890` is at index 0. Because the separator is at the very beginning of the string, `re.split` produces an empty string `""` as the first element.
    *   **Text between first and second match**: Following the first number is `" abiguygusu "`.
    *   **Second match**: `876-286-9876`.
    *   **Text between second and third match**: Following the second number is `" kjgufwycs "`.
    *   **Third match**: `987-762-9767`.
    *   **Text after third match**: The third number is at the very end of the string. Because the separator is at the end, `re.split` produces an empty string `""` as the last element.

4.  **Result**: The resulting list contains the parts of the string not matching the pattern: `['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']`.
