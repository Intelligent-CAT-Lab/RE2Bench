Let's execute the `heal` method step by step with the provided input.

1.  **Initialize State**: The `RPGCharacter` instance is initialized with the values from the `self` dictionary:
    *   `self.hp` = 100
    *   (Other attributes like `name`, `attack_power`, etc., are present but not used by this method).

2.  **Execute `heal` Method**:
    *   The code executes `self.hp += 10`.
    *   Current `self.hp` is 100.
    *   New `self.hp` becomes 100 + 10 = 110.

3.  **Check Condition**:
    *   The code executes `if self.hp > 100:`.
    *   Is 110 > 100? Yes.

4.  **Apply Cap**:
    *   The code executes `self.hp = 100`.
    *   `self.hp` is reset to 100.

5.  **Return Value**:
    *   The method returns `self.hp`.
    *   The value returned is 100.
