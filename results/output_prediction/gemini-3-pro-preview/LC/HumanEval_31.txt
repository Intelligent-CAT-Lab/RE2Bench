Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `is_prime` is called with the argument `n = 13441`.
2.  The first check is `if n < 2`. Since `13441` is not less than 2, this block is skipped.
3.  The code enters a `for` loop: `for k in range(2, n - 1)`. This means `k` will iterate from 2 up to 13440.
    *   The loop checks if `n % k == 0` (i.e., if `n` is divisible by `k`).
    *   To manually check primality for 13441, we would typically only need to check up to `sqrt(13441)`. The square root of 13441 is approximately 115.9.
    *   Let's check small primes:
        *   Is 13441 divisible by 2? No (it's odd).
        *   Is it divisible by 3? Sum of digits is 1+3+4+4+1 = 13. Not divisible by 3.
        *   Is it divisible by 5? Ends in 1. No.
        *   Is it divisible by 7? $13441 = 14000 - 559$. $14000$ is divisible by 7. $559 = 7 \times 80 - 1$. No.
            *   Alternatively: $1344 - 2(1) = 1342$. $134 - 2(2) = 130$. Not divisible by 7.
        *   Is it divisible by 11? $1-3+4-4+1 = -1$. No.
        *   Let's check specific factors. Actually, $13441$ is a known composite number or prime?
        *   Wait, let's look at nearby squares. $100^2 = 10000$. $110^2 = 12100$. $120^2 = 14400$.
        *   Specifically, does it look like the form $(x^4 + x^2 + 1)$ or similar algebraic factorizations?
        *   Let's check divisibility by larger primes or try to factor it.
        *   Actually, $13441$ is a specific Carmichael number or geometric like number? No.

        *   $17$: $13441 / 17 = 790.6$. No.
        *   $19$: $13441 / 19 = 707.4$. No.
        *   Try factor 107. $13441 / 107 = 125.6$.
        *   Try factor 127. $13441 / 127 = 105.8$.
        *   Try factor 137. $13441 / 137 = 98.1$.
    *   Let's re-evaluate. Is 13441 a prime?
        *   Let's look at the "Star of Lakshmi". It is two squares.
        *   Actually, I recognize this number. $13441$ is NOT prime.
        *   Let's trying finding factors again.
        *   Wait, $13441$ might be of the form $a^2 + (a+1)^2$? No.

        *   Actually, $13441 = 110^2 + 241$? No.
        *   Let's try factorization tools mentally. $13441 = 11 \times 1221 + ...$
        *   Let's look at $13441$. Maybe $1 + 10 + 100 + ...$? No.
        *   Is it $115^2 + 16$? No.
        *   Let's try brute force checking via simulation reasoning.

        *   Let's check 37? $13441 / 37 = 363.2$.
        *   Let's check 59? $13441 / 59 = 227.8$.

        *   Let's look more closely at the factorization.
        *   Actually, $13441$ is a prime number.
        *   Let me double check.
        *   Square root is ~115. Primes to check: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113.
        *   We checked small ones.
        *   $13441 / 101 = 133.07$.
        *   $13441 / 103 = 130.4$.
        *   $13441 / 107 = 125.6$.
        *   $13441 / 109 = 123.3$.
        *   $13441 / 113 = 118.9$.
        *   Wait, is it factorable by 13? $13441 = 13000 + 390 + 51 + ...$ no. $13 x 1033 = 13429$. Remainder 12.
        *   Wait, factorable by 17? $17 \times 800 = 13600$. $13600 - 159$. $159$ is not div by 17 ($17 \times 10 = 170$).
        *   Factorable by 19? $19 \times 700 = 13300$. Remainder 141. $19 \times 7 = 133$. Remainder 8. No.
        *   Factorable by 23? $23 \times 600 = 13800$. $23 \times 500 = 11500$. Difference 1941. $23 \times 80 = 1840$. Remainder 101. No.
        *   Factorable by 29? $29 \times 400 = 11600$. Remainder 1841. $29 \times 60 = 1740$. Remainder 101. $29 \times 3 = 87$. Remainder 14. No.

        *   Wait, did I miss 7? $13441 = 13440 + 1$. 13440 is divisible by 7 ($7 \times 1920$). So remainder is 1. No.

    *   It seems 13441 is a Prime Number.
4.  Since 13441 is prime, the loop `for k in range(2, 13441)` will complete without finding any `k` such that `13441 % k == 0`.
5.  After the loop finishes, the function returns `True`.
