To predict the output, I will trace the execution of the `as_content_primitive` method in the `Expr` class.

[THOUGHT]
1.  **Identify the Method:** The function to be executed is `Expr.as_content_primitive`.
2.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `Expr` (represented by `{ "nargs": "{1}" }`). Let's refer to this object as `self`.
    *   `result args`: `radical=False`, `clear=False`.
3.  **Trace Execution:**
    *   The method definition is:
        ```python
        def as_content_primitive(self, radical=False, clear=True):
            return (S.One, self)
        ```
    *   The method does not use the `radical` or `clear` arguments in its logic.
    *   It returns a tuple `(S.One, self)`.
    *   `S.One` represents the singleton integer 1 in SymPy.
    *   `self` is the object itself.
4.  **Formulate Output:** The output should be a tuple containing the representation of "One" and the representation of `self`. In the JSON context, this typically translates to a list or a formatted string representation of the tuple structure. The question asks for the `output` variable value.
    *   The structure shows `"output": XXX`.
    *   The return value is a tuple `(S.One, self)`.
    *   The input JSON representation of `self` is `{"nargs": "{1}"}`.
    *   `S.One` is typically represented just as `1` or an object representing 1. In typical SymPy serialization or string representation for these challenges, `S.One` is often just `1`.
    *   So the tuple is `(1, {"nargs": "{1}"})`.
