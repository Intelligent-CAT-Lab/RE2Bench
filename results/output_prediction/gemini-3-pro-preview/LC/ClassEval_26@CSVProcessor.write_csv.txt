[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `write_csv` method.

1.  **Input Analysis**:
    -   `data`: `[["a", "b", "c", "d"], ["ME"]]` (A list of lists, which `csv.writerows` expects).
    -   `file_name`: `"read_test_process.csv"`.

2.  **Function Logic**:
    -   `with open(file_name, 'w', newline='') as file:`: This attempts to open the file in write mode. Assuming standard file system permissions and path validity in this theoretical execution environment, this operation succeeds.
    -   `writer = csv.writer(file)`: Creates a CSV writer object.
    -   `writer.writerows(data)`: Writes the data to the file.
        -   Row 1: `a,b,c,d`
        -   Row 2: `ME`
    -   If these steps complete without raising an exception (which they should for valid input data and file names), the function proceeds to `return 1`.
    -   The `except:` block catches any errors and returns `0`. Since the data is well-formed (list of lists of strings) and the filename is valid, no exception is expected.

3.  **Conclusion**: The successful execution path returns integer `1`.
