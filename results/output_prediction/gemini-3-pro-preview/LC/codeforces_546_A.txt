Let's analyze the execution of the code step by step.

1.  **Input Reading:**
    The input string provided is `"1 1 1"`.
    `input().strip().split()` reads this string, strips whitespace, and splits it by spaces.
    The result is `['1', '1', '1']`.
    `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to integers.
    So, `k = 1`, `n = 1`, `w = 1`.

2.  **Loop Initialization:**
    `sum` is initialized to `0`.

3.  **Loop Execution:**
    The loop runs `for i in range(1, w + 1)`. Since `w` is 1, the range is `range(1, 2)`.
    The loop will execute only once for `i = 1`.

    *   **Iteration 1 (i = 1):**
        `sum += k * i`
        `sum += 1 * 1`
        `sum` becomes `1`.

4.  **Conditional Check:**
    `if sum <= n:`
    Here, `sum` is `1` and `n` is `1`.
    The condition `1 <= 1` is **True**.

5.  **Output:**
    Since the condition is true, the code executes `print(0)`.

[THOUGHT]
The code calculates the total cost of `w` bananas where the `i`-th banana costs `i * k`. The user has `n` dollars. It prints how much money needs to be borrowed (0 if user has enough).
Input: k=1, n=1, w=1.
Total cost = 1 * 1 = 1.
User has 1.
Cost (1) <= User has (1).
So borrow 0.
Variable states:
k=1, n=1, w=1
sum starts at 0.
Loop i=1: sum becomes 0 + 1*1 = 1.
Loop ends.
Check: sum (1) <= n (1). This is True.
Print 0.
