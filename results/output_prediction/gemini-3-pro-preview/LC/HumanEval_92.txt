Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Analysis**: The function `any_int` is called with arguments `x=2`, `y=1`, and `z=1`.

2.  **Type Check**:
    The code first checks `if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int):`.
    - `x` is 2 (int), `y` is 1 (int), `z` is 1 (int).
    - All are integers, so the condition evaluates to `True`. We enter the `if` block.

3.  **Logic Check**:
    Inside the `if` block, there's another condition:
    `if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x:`
    - Let's evaluate each part:
        - `x + y == z` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` -> `False`.
        - `x + z == y` -> `2 + 1 == 1` -> `3 == 1` -> `False`.
        - `y + z == x` -> `1 + 1 == 2` -> `2 == 2` -> `True`.
    - Since one of the conditions (`y + z == x`) is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.

4.  **Return**:
    The code executes `return True`.
