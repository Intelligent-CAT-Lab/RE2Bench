Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input Reading**: The code reads the input string: `"2.4"`.
2.  **Splitting**: `num = input().split('.')` splits the string at the decimal point.
    -   `num` becomes the list `['2', '4']`.
    -   `num[0]` is `'2'`.
    -   `num[1]` is `'4'`.
3.  **Condition 1**: `if int(num[0][-1]) == 9:`
    -   `num[0]` is `'2'`.
    -   `num[0][-1]` takes the last character of `'2'`, which is just `'2'`.
    -   `int('2')` is `2`.
    -   The check `2 == 9` is `False`.
4.  **Condition 2**: `elif int(num[1][0]) >= 5:`
    -   `num[1]` is `'4'`.
    -   `num[1][0]` takes the first character of `'4'`, which is `'4'`.
    -   `int('4')` is `4`.
    -   The check `4 >= 5` is `False`.
5.  **Else Block**: Since both previous conditions failed, the code executes the `else` block.
    -   `print(num[0])` is executed.
    -   `num[0]` is `'2'`.
    -   The output is printed to the console.
