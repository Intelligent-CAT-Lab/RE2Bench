[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list called `array` and an element called `elem` as input. The goal is to find the index of `elem` within `array`.

1.  **Check Condition:** The code first checks `if elem in array`. Here, `array` is `[6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem` is `6`.
2.  **Evaluate Condition:** Is `6` present in the list `[6, 2, 7, 1]`? Yes, it is the first element.
3.  **Execute True Branch:** Since the condition is true, the code executes `return array.index(elem)`.
4.  **Find Index:** The method `.index(6)` is called on the list. Python lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. Since 6 is at the very beginning, its index is 0.
5.  **Return:** The function returns `0`.
