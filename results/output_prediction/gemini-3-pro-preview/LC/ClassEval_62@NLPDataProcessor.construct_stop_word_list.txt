[THOUGHT]
The function `construct_stop_word_list` is a simple method within the `NLPDataProcessor` class. 

1.  **Input:** The input JSON specifies that the method is called with no arguments (`args` and `kwargs` are empty) and the object `self` has no specific state relevant to this method.
2.  **Execution:**
    *   Inside the method, a list named `stop_word_list` is defined: `['a', 'an', 'the']`.
    *   The method then returns this list directly.
3.  **Result:** The output will be the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`.
