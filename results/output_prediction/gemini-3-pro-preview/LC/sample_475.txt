Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with arguments `array = [1]` and `index = 0`.
2. Inside the function, the first line checks `if index < 0`.
3. The value of `index` is 0. Since 0 is not less than 0, the condition is False.
4. The code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.
5. The function proceeds to `return array[index]`.
6. This evaluates to `return array[0]`.
7. The element at index 0 of `[1]` is `1`.
