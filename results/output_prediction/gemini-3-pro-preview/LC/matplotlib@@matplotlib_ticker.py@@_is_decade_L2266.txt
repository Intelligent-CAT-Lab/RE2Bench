[THOUGHT]
The function `_is_decade` checks if a number `x` is a power of `base` (default 10) within a tolerance `rtol`.

1.  **Input Analysis**:
    *   `x`: `1e-07` (0.0000001)
    *   `base`: `10`
    *   `rtol`: `1e-07`

2.  **Execution Trace**:
    *   `np.isfinite(x)`: `1e-07` is finite. The check `if not np.isfinite(x)` evaluates to `False`.
    *   `if x == 0.0`: `1e-07` is not equal to 0.0. The check evaluates to `False`.
    *   `np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)`:
        *   `abs(x)` is `1e-07`.
        *   `base` is `10`.
        *   `np.log(1e-07)` (natural log) is approximately -16.118...
        *   `np.log(10)` (natural log) is approximately 2.3025...
        *   Ideally, this is $\log_{10}(10^{-7})$, which equals -7.0 exactly.
        *   Let's assume standard floating point arithmetic. `np.log10(1e-07)` is extremely close to -7.0.
        *   `lx` is approx -7.0.
    *   `if rtol is None`: `rtol` is provided as `1e-07`, so this block is skipped.
    *   `else` block:
        *   `return np.isclose(lx, np.round(lx), rtol=rtol)`
        *   `lx` is -7.0.
        *   `np.round(lx)` is -7.0.
        *   `np.isclose(-7.0, -7.0, rtol=1e-07)` checks if the two values are close. Since they are essentially identical (floating point representation of 1e-7 is exact enough for log10 to be very close to an integer), this returns `True`.

3.  **Result**: The function returns `True`.
