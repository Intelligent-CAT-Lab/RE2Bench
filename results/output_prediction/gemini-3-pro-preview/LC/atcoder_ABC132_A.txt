I will simulate the execution of the code step by step.

1.  **Input Reading**: The problem provides the input `"FFEE"`.
    `s = sorted(input())` reads the string `"FFEE"`.

2.  **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function sorts the characters of the string in ascending ASCII order.
    The string `"FFEE"` consists of characters 'F', 'F', 'E', 'E'.
    'E' comes before 'F' in alphabetical (and ASCII) order.
    So, the sorted list `s` becomes `['E', 'E', 'F', 'F']`.

3.  **Condition Checking**:
    The code checks the condition: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[2] == s[3] and (s[0] != s[2]):`

    -   `s[0]` is 'E'.
    -   `s[1]` is 'E'.
    -   `s[2]` is 'F'.
    -   `s[3]` is 'F'.

    Let's evaluate the parts:
    -   `s[0] == s[1]`: 'E' == 'E' is `True`.
    -   `s[2] == s[3]`: 'F' == 'F' is `True`.
    -   `s[0] != s[2]`: 'E' != 'F' is `True`.

    The combined condition is `True and True and True`, which results in `True`.

4.  **Execution Branch**: Since the condition is true, the code executes the statement inside the `if` block.
    `print('Yes')`

5.  **Output**: The output is `Yes`.

{
    "output": "Yes"
