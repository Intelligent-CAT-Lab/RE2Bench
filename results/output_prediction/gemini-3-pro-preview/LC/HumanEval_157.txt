Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Definition:** The function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` checks if three side lengths can form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse). It checks all three permutations since any side could be the hypotenuse.

2.  **Input Values:** The provided inputs are:
    *   `a = 10`
    *   `b = 6`
    *   `c = 8`

3.  **The Expression:** The return statement evaluates the following boolean expression:
    `a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b`

4.  **Evaluate Terms:** First, let's calculate the squares of the inputs:
    *   `a * a` = $10 \times 10 = 100$
    *   `b * b` = $6 \times 6 = 36$
    *   `c * c` = $8 \times 8 = 64$

5.  **Evaluate Conditions:**
    *   **Part 1:** `a * a == b * b + c * c`
        *   Is $100 == 36 + 64$?
        *   Is $100 == 100$?
        *   This is `True`.

    *   At this point, since the first part of the `or` chain is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True` immediately (short-circuit evaluation). The program does not need to check the other conditions.

6.  **Return:** The function returns `True`.
