Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Function Call:** `f` is called with the dictionary `d = {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.
2.  **`d = d.copy()`:** A shallow copy of the dictionary is created. The new dictionary `d` is `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`. This ensures the original dictionary passed as input is not modified, though in this context, we only care about the return value.
3.  **`d.popitem()`:** The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last key-value pair inserted into the dictionary. In Python 3.7+ (and effectively in standard usage), dictionaries preserve insertion order. The items were defined in the order: "l", then "t", then "x:".
    *   The last item is `"x:": 3`.
    *   `d.popitem()` removes this entry.
    *   The dictionary `d` becomes `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
4.  **`return d`:** The function returns the modified dictionary `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.

{
    "l": 1,
