The code checks if the input number is a power of 2.

1.  **Input:** The variable `n` is initialized with the input value `9`.
2.  **While loop:** The condition `while n % 2 == 0:` checks if `n` is even.
    *   Since `n` is 9, `9 % 2` equals 1 (odd).
    *   The condition is False immediately, so the loop body is never executed.
3.  **If-Else block:**
    *   The code checks `if n == 1:`.
    *   Currently, `n` is still 9.
    *   The condition `9 == 1` is False.
    *   The code moves to the `else` block.
    *   It executes `print('NO')`.
