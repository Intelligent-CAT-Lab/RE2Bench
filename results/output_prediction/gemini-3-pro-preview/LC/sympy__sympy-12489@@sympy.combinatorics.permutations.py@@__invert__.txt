[THOUGHT]
The user wants to predict the output of the `__invert__` method for a `Permutation` object.

1.  **Analyze the Input:** The input JSON provides `self` with `_array_form` set to `null` (None) and `_size` set to 5.
2.  **Analyze the Logic:** The `__invert__` method calls `self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))`.
3.  **Variable Resolution:** `self._array_form` is `None` in the input. While `_af_invert` normally expects a list, if `_array_form` is missing but `_size` is present, usually, a default identity permutation is implied or initialized. However, assuming standard SymPy `Permutation` behavior where `_array_form` must be populated or inferred, if it's `None`, we look at how `_af_new` or relevant property accessors handle it. Let's assume the standard identity array for size 5: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4.  **Inversion:** The inverse of the identity permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is itself `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
5.  **Output Construction:** The result is a new Permutation object with `_array_form` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `_size` as 5.
