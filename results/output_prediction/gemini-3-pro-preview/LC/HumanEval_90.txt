[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input. The input provided is `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.
2. First, the code executes `set(lst)`. This creates a set from the list, removing any duplicate values. The set will define the unique elements: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
3. Next, `sorted(...)` is called on this set. This sorts the unique elements in ascending order. The resulting list `lst` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. Then, the code checks the length of this new list: `len(lst)`. The length is 5.
5. The condition `len(lst) < 2` (5 < 2) is False.
6. Therefore, the function returns the `else` Branch: `lst[1]`.
7. `lst[1]` accesses the element at index 1 (the second element) of the sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
8. The element at index 0 is 1. The element at index 1 is 2.
9. The function returns `2`.
