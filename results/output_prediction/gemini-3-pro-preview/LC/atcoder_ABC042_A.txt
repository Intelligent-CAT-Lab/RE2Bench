To determine the output, I will trace the execution of the Python code with the provided input.

1.  **Input Reading**: The code reads the input string `"7 5 5"`.
2.  **Parsing**: `input().split()` splits the string into a list: `['7', '5', '5']`.
3.  **Mapping and Tuple Creation**: `map(int, ...)` converts these strings to integers, and `tuple(...)` forms the tuple `ABC`.
    *   `ABC` becomes `(7, 5, 5)`.
4.  **Condition Check 1**: The code executes `if ABC.count(5) == 2:`.
    *   The tuple is `(7, 5, 5)`.
    *   The number `5` appears twice.
    *   The condition is `True`.
5.  **Nested Condition Check**: Inside the `if` block, it executes `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')`.
    *   It calculates `sum(ABC)`.
    *   `7 + 5 + 5 = 17`.
    *   The condition `sum(ABC) == 17` is `True`.
6.  **Output**: Since the condition is true, it prints `'YES'`.

[THOUGHT]
The code first reads the input "7 5 5". It splits this string into individual components and converts them to integers, resulting in the tuple `(7, 5, 5)`.
Next, it checks if the number `5` appears exactly `2` times in the tuple. In `(7, 5, 5)`, the count of 5 is indeed 2.
Since the first condition is met, it proceeds to check if the sum of the elements in the tuple equals `17`. The sum is `7 + 5 + 5 = 17`.
Because the sum is 17, the program prints 'YES'.
