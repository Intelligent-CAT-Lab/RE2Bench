The user wants me to simulate the execution of the provided Python code based on the given input.

**Step-by-step execution:**

1.  **Input:** The input provided is the string `"1"`.
2.  **`x = int(input())`**: The code reads the input `"1"` and converts it to an integer. So, `x` becomes the integer `1`.
3.  **`if x == 1:`**: The code checks if the value of `x` (which is `1`) is equal to `1`. This condition is `True`.
4.  **`print(0)`**: Since the condition is true, the code executes the print statement inside the `if` block, printing `0`.

[THOUGHT]
The input is "1".
The code converts this input to an integer: x = 1.
Then it checks if x == 1.
Since 1 == 1 is True, it enters the if block.
It prints 0.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "0"
}
```
