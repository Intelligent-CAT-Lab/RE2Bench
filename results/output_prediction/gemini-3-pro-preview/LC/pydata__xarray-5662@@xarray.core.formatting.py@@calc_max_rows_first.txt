[THOUGHT]
The function `calc_max_rows_first` takes an integer `max_rows` as input.
It calculates `max_rows // 2` (integer division) and adds the remainder `max_rows % 2`.
This logic effectively splits the rows into two halves, but if the number is odd, the "first" part gets the extra row.

Input `max_rows` is 12.
1. `max_rows // 2`: 12 divided by 2 is 6.
2. `max_rows % 2`: 12 modulo 2 is 0 (since 12 is even).
3. The sum is 6 + 0 = 6.

So the output should be 6.
