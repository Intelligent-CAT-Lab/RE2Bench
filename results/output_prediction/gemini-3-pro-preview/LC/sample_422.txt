Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Input:** The function `f` is called with `array = [1, 2, 1]`.
2.  **Copy:** `new_array = array.copy()` creates a new list `[1, 2, 1]`.
3.  **Reverse:** `new_array = reversed(new_array)` returns an iterator that yields items from the list in reverse order. The elements will be yielded as `1`, then `2`, then `1`.
4.  **List Comprehension:** `[x * x for x in new_array]` iterates over the reversed sequence.
    *   First element is `1`. Calculation: `1 * 1 = 1`.
    *   Second element is `2`. Calculation: `2 * 2 = 4`.
    *   Third element is `1`. Calculation: `1 * 1 = 1`.
5.  **Result:** The resulting list is `[1, 4, 1]`.
