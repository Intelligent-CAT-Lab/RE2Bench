[THOUGHT]
The function `_cmp_name` compares two classes `x` and `y` based on their names and a predefined ordering list.

1.  **Extract Names**:
    -   `x` is given as the class `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit'>`. `x.__name__` is `"ImaginaryUnit"`.
    -   `y` is given as the class `<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'>`. `y.__name__` is `"Pi"`.
    -   `n1 = "ImaginaryUnit"`.
    -   `n2 = "Pi"`.

2.  **Equality Check**:
    -   `n1 == n2` ("ImaginaryUnit" == "Pi") is False.

3.  **Subclass Check**:
    -   `issubclass(y, Basic)` checks if `Pi` inherits from `Basic`. In the SymPy library hierarchy, `Pi` inherits from `Number`, which inherits from `AtomicExpr`, which inherits from `Basic`. Thus, this check is True. The code `if not ...` evaluates to False, so it proceeds.

4.  **Ordering List Lookup**:
    -   The code attempts to look up `n1` and `n2` in `ordering_of_classes`.
    -   The variable `ordering_of_classes` is not defined in the provided snippets. However, in standard SymPy logic (where this function originates), this list typically contains structural classes like `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Symbol`, `Integer`, etc., to define canonical ordering for expression trees. It rarely contains specific singleton number classes like `ImaginaryUnit` or `Pi`.
    -   Assuming `ordering_of_classes` does not contain "ImaginaryUnit" or "Pi" (or assuming the list is empty/unavailable given the constrained context), the `try...except ValueError` blocks will catch the exception.
    -   `i1` becomes `UNKNOWN`.
    -   `i2` becomes `UNKNOWN`.

5.  **Fallback Comparison**:
    -   The condition `if i1 == UNKNOWN and i2 == UNKNOWN:` is True.
    -   The return statement is `(n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)`. This performs a lexicographical string comparison.
    -   Comparing "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi":
        -   The first character 'I' (ASCII 73) is less than 'P' (ASCII 80).
        -   Therefore, "ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi".
    -   Evaluate terms:
        -   `n1 > n2` ("ImaginaryUnit" > "Pi") is `False` (int 0).
        -   `n1 < n2` ("ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi") is `True` (int 1).
    -   Calculation: `0 - 1 = -1`.

6.  **Result**: The function returns `-1`.
