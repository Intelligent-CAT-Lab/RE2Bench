To determine the output, let's trace the execution of the Python code with the provided input.

**Input:** `"80 970"`

**Step-by-step Execution:**

1.  **Reading Input:**
    ```python
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    ```
    - The input string is `"80 970"`.
    - Splitting gives `["80", "970"]`.
    - Mapping to integers gives `a = 80` and `b = 970`.

2.  **Initialization:**
    ```python
    x = a  # x = 80
    h = 0
    s = 0
    ```

3.  **First While Loop:**
    ```python
    while x > 0:
        x -= 1
        h += 1
        s += 1
    ```
    - This loop runs exactly `a` times (80 times).
    - In each iteration:
        - `x` decrements by 1 (goes from 80 down to 0).
        - `h` increments by 1.
        - `s` increments by 1.
    - After the loop finishes:
        - `x = 0`
        - `h = 80`
        - `s = 80`

4.  **Second While Loop:**
    ```python
    while s // b != 0:
        h += 1
        s = s - b + 1
    ```
    - `s` is currently 80.
    - `b` is 970.
    - Let's check the condition: `s // b` => `80 // 970`.
    - Since 80 is less than 970, integer division results in 0.
    - The condition `0 != 0` is False.
    - The loop body is skipped entirely.

5.  **Print Output:**
    ```python
    print(h)
    ```
    - The value of `h` is 80.

**Conclusion:**
The program prints `80`.
