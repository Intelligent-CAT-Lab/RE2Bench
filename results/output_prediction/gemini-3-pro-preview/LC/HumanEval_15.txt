Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input. In this case, `n` is provided as 10.
2.  The core logic lies in the list comprehension `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]`.
3.  `range(n + 1)` creates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is 10, the range will be from 0 to 10: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.
4.  The list comprehension iterates over each number `x` in this range and converts it to a string using `str(x)`. The resulting list is `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']`.
5.  Finally, `' '.join(...)` takes this list of strings and joins them together into a single string, separating each element with a space character.
6.  The result of the join operation is `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
