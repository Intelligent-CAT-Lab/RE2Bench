Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `simplify` takes two arguments `x` and `n`.
2.  Input `x` is `"7/2"` and `n` is `"4/2"`.
3.  `a, b = x.split('/')`: `x` is split by `/`. So, `a` becomes `"7"` and `b` becomes `"2"`.
4.  `c, d = n.split('/')`: `n` is split by `/`. So, `c` becomes `"4"` and `d` becomes `"2"`.
5.  `numerator = int(a) * int(c)`:
    - `int(a)` is `7`.
    - `int(c)` is `4`.
    - `numerator` becomes `7 * 4 = 28`.
6.  `denom = int(b) * int(d)`:
    - `int(b)` is `2`.
    - `int(d)` is `2`.
    - `denom` becomes `2 * 2 = 4`.
7.  The condition `if numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom):` is checked.
    - `numerator / denom` is `28 / 4`, which calculates to `7.0`.
    - `int(numerator / denom)` is `int(7.0)`, which is `7`.
    - Since `7.0 == 7`, the condition is True.
8.  The function returns `True`.
