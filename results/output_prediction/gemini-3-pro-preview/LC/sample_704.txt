Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Inputs**:
    *   `s` = "."
    *   `n` = 0
    *   `c` = "99"

2.  **Calculate `width`**:
    *   `len(c)` is `len("99")` which is 2.
    *   `n` is 0.
    *   `width = 2 * 0 = 0`.

3.  **Loop condition**:
    *   The loop runs for the range `width - len(s)`.
    *   `len(s)` is `len(".")` which is 1.
    *   The range is `0 - 1 = -1`.
    *   `range(-1)` is empty because the start (default 0) is greater than the stop (-1).

4.  **Loop execution**:
    *   Since the range is empty/invalid for a forward iteration (default step is +1), the loop body `s = c + s` is never executed.

5.  **Return**:
    *   The function returns the current value of `s`.
    *   `s` remains "." (the initial input).
