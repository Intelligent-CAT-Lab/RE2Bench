[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialize**: The `AssessmentSystem` is initialized with a dictionary of students.
2.  **Input Data**: The specific student we are interested in is "Charlie".
    *   `self.students["Charlie"]` exists.
    *   The data for Charlie is: `{"name": "Charlie", "grade": 2, "major": "Chemistry", "courses": {"Chemistry": 70, "Physics": 80}}`.
3.  **Execute `get_gpa("Charlie")`**:
    *   Line `if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:` checks if "Charlie" is in the dictionary and if he has courses.
    *   "Charlie" is in `self.students`.
    *   `self.students["Charlie"]['courses']` is `{'Chemistry': 70, 'Physics': 80}`, which is not empty (truthy).
    *   The condition evaluates to `True`.
4.  **Calculate GPA**:
    *   `self.students["Charlie"]['courses'].values()` refers to the values `[70, 80]`.
    *   `sum(...)`: 70 + 80 = 150.
    *   `len(...)`: The number of courses is 2.
    *   `150 / 2` = 75.0.
5.  **Return**: The function returns 75.0.
