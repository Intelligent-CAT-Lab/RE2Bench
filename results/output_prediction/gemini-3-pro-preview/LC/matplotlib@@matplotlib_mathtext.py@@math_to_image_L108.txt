To predict the output of `math_to_image`, we simulate the execution of the function steps:

1.  The function `math_to_image` is called with arguments: `s="$x^2$"`, `filename_or_obj` (a Path object), and default keywords (`prop=None`, `dpi=None`, `format=None`, `color=None`).
2.  Inside the function, `from matplotlib import figure` is executed.
3.  `parser = MathTextParser('path')` creates a parser for vector outputs (paths).
4.  `parser.parse(s, dpi=72, prop=prop)` is called.
    *   `s` is `"$x^2$"`.
    *   `dpi` is 72.
    *   `prop` is `None`.
5.  The parser calculates the bounding box metrics for the rendered LaTeX-style math string.
    *   The string consists of the variable 'x' and the exponent '2'.
    *   The character 'x' sits on the baseline.
    *   The character '2' is a superscript, positioned above the baseline.
    *   Neither character has a descender (parts extending below the baseline, like in 'g', 'y', 'p', or subscripts).
    *   The `depth` metric represents the distance from the baseline to the bottom of the content.
    *   Since no content goes below the baseline, the `depth` is `0` (or `0.0`).
6.  The function proceeds to create a Figure and save it, but the return value depends solely on `depth`.
7.  The function returns `depth`.
8.  Based on standard font metrics for '$x^2$', the depth is 0.
