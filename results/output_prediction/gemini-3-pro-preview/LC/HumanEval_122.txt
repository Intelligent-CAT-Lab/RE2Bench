Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  **Inputs**: The function `add_elements` is called with `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `k = 4`.

2.  **Slicing**: The list `arr` is sliced using `arr[:k]`, which means taking the first 4 elements.
    *   `arr[:4]` results in `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.

3.  **Filtering**: The code iterates through this sliced list `[111, 21, 3, 4000]` and applies a filter: `if len(str(elem)) <= 2`. This checks if the string representation of the number has 2 or fewer characters (i.e., is it a 1-digit or 2-digit number?).
    *   For `111`: `str(111)` is "111", length is 3. (3 <= 2 is False). **Excluded**.
    *   For `21`: `str(21)` is "21", length is 2. (2 <= 2 is True). **Included**.
    *   For `3`: `str(3)` is "3", length is 1. (1 <= 2 is True). **Included**.
    *   For `4000`: `str(4000)` is "4000", length is 4. (4 <= 2 is False). **Excluded**.

4.  **Summing**: The `sum()` function sums the elements that passed the filter.
    *   The included elements are `21` and `3`.
    *   Sum = `21 + 3 = 24`.

5.  **Return**: The function returns `24`.
