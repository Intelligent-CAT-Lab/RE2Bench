[THOUGHT]
I'll walk through build_digest_header step by step with the provided inputs.

1. Extract challenge fields from self.chal:
   - realm = "me@kennethreitz.com"
   - nonce = "2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899"
   - qop = "auth"
   - algorithm = "MD5"
   - opaque = "3b88561378508443a8b14a91ec359904"

2. Determine hash function:
   - algorithm is "MD5", so hash_utf8(x) is MD5 of x encoded as UTF-8.

3. Construct A1 and A2:
   - A1 = 'user:me@kennethreitz.com:pass'
   - A2 = 'GET:/digest-auth/auth/user/pass' (urlparse of the URL gives path '/digest-auth/auth/user/pass')

4. Compute HA1 = MD5(A1) and HA2 = MD5(A2).
   - These are deterministic given A1 and A2.

5. Nonce count handling:
   - self.last_nonce is '' which does not equal the nonce, so nonce_count is set to 1.
   - ncvalue = '%08x' % 1 = '00000001'

6. Generate cnonce:
   - cnonce is computed from:
       s = b'1' + nonce.encode('utf-8') + time.ctime().encode('utf-8') + os.urandom(8)
     and then cnonce = sha1(s).hexdigest()[:16]
   - cnonce therefore depends on the current time (time.ctime()) and on os.urandom(8), both of which are runtime-dependent and not specified in the input. Thus cnonce cannot be determined from the given static input.

7. Compute respdig:
   - noncebit = '{nonce}:{ncvalue}:{cnonce}:{qop}:{HA2}'
   - respdig = MD5(HA1 + ':' + noncebit)
   - Because cnonce is unknown, respdig is also not determinable from the given input.

8. Build the Authorization header string:
   - The code returns a string of the form:
     Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="2cb6ca3bd92f46300c21bc6652450899", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="<respdig>"[, opaque="3b8856...", algorithm="MD5"][, qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="<cnonce>"]
   - The presence of opaque, algorithm, qop, nc and cnonce depends on challenge fields; here opaque and algorithm are present and qop is present, so those get appended.

Because the exact values of cnonce and the computed response depend on time and random bytes (os.urandom), they cannot be determined from the static input. I will therefore return the header with these two runtime-dependent values shown as placeholders.
