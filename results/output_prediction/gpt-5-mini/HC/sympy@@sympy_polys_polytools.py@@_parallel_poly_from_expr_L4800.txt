[THOUGHT]
We run _parallel_poly_from_expr with exprs = ["2", "-1*2*cos(phi)"] and opt = {} (a plain dict).

1. The function sees len(exprs) == 2, so it assigns f = "2", g = "-1*2*cos(phi)". It then checks isinstance(f, Poly) and isinstance(g, Poly). Both are plain strings, so that branch is skipped.

2. It sets origs = list(exprs) and exprs = [].

3. It begins iterating over origs. For the first item (i=0, expr = "2") it calls sympify("2") which returns a SymPy Integer (an instance of Basic). The code enters the if isinstance(expr, Basic) branch.

4. Inside that branch it checks expr.is_Poly (False) and so goes to the else block where it does:
   _exprs.append(i)
   if opt.expand:
       expr = expr.expand()

   Here opt is the plain dict {} from input. The code attempts attribute access opt.expand. In Python that tries to get attribute 'expand' on a dict object, which does not exist, causing an AttributeError to be raised: 'dict' object has no attribute 'expand'.

5. Thus execution stops with AttributeError before the function can complete or return any result.

Therefore the call raises an AttributeError with message "'dict' object has no attribute 'expand'".
