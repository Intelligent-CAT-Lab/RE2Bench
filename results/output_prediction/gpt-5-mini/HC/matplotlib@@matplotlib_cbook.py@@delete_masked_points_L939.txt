[THOUGHT]
- The function receives three positional arguments: two sequences of length 10 and a null (None).
- len(args) == 3, so we proceed.
- is_scalar_or_string(args[0]) is False because the first arg is iterable (a list).
- nrecs = len(args[0]) = 10.
- Convert the first two lists to numpy arrays (they are not masked arrays). The third argument remains None.
- For each sequence argument, compute np.isfinite(xd). All entries are finite, so masks for both arrays are arrays of ten True values.
- Combine masks with logical_and.reduce -> an all-True mask. igood becomes indices [0..9]. Since len(igood) == nrecs, no elements are removed.
- No masked arrays to .filled(), so returned margs are the two numpy arrays (unchanged) and None.
- Representing the numpy arrays as lists for JSON output, the result is [first_list, second_list, null].
