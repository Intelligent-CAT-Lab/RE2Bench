[THOUGHT]
1. The code checks GROUND_TYPES == 'flint'. That is not the case here, so the non-flint path runs.
2. dup_primitive(f, K) with f = [1] returns (cont, g). The content of [1] is 1, and since cont == 1, dup_primitive returns (1, [1]).
3. dup_degree(g) where g = [1] gives len([1]) - 1 = 0, so n = 0.
4. Since n <= 0, dup_zz_factor returns (cont, []) which is (1, []).
