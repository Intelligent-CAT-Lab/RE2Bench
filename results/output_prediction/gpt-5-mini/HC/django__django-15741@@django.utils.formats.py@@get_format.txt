[THOUGHT]
1. get_format is called with format_type = "jS \\o\\f F", lang = None, use_l10n = None.
2. Because use_l10n is None, the function tries: use_l10n = settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL. settings is Django's LazySettings, and _USE_L10N_INTERNAL exists as an attribute (a bound method). So use_l10n becomes that bound method object (which is truthy).
3. The code then checks "if use_l10n and lang is None:" — since use_l10n is a truthy bound method and lang is None, it sets lang = get_language().
4. get_language() returns a language code (e.g. "en-us"), but the exact language value is irrelevant for the next step because get_format will attempt to find a format in localization modules and fall back to default when none is found.
5. The code attempts to find a localized value for the given format_type. No localized module provides an attribute named "jS \\o\\f F", so val remains None.
6. Since val is None, the function checks whether the format_type is in FORMAT_SETTINGS. "jS \\o\\f F" is not one of the keys in FORMAT_SETTINGS.
7. Because format_type is not a known setting name, the function returns the format_type itself unchanged.
8. Therefore the output will be the same string that was passed in: "jS \\o\\f F".
