We need to simulate NMF.transform:

1. check_is_fitted(self) passes because estimator has attributes ending with underscore (e.g., n_features_in_, components_).
2. validate_data will accept the given X as a (6,5) array (all entries non-negative), so X is validated and passed through.
3. transform calls self._fit_transform(X, H=self.components_, update_H=False). With update_H=False and solver='cd' the algorithm solves for W (n_samples x n_components) with H fixed. This reduces to solving, for each sample row x (shape (5,)), the non-negative least squares problem:
   minimize_w >= 0 || w @ H - x ||^2.
   Equivalently, for A = H^T (shape 5x3) we solve A w = x in NNLS for each sample.

4. I computed the NNLS solutions by solving the normal equations (A^T A) w = A^T x and verified that the unconstrained least-squares solutions were non-negative for these samples, so they are the NNLS solutions.

5. I computed A = H^T from components_ and then precomputed M = A^T A and used it to solve for w for each sample. For reproducibility, I show the first sample (row 1) computation in summary:

   - For sample x1 = [0.49671415, 0.1382643, 0.64768854, 1.52302986, 0.23415337]
   - b = A^T x1 ≈ [3.0835, 1.13163, 0.41916]
   - Solving M w = b gives w ≈ [0.8416, 0.02717, 0.29493]

6. Repeating this for all six samples gives the W matrix (each row corresponds to a sample). The computed W (rounded) is:

[
 [0.841616, 0.027170, 0.294927],
 [0.163197, 0.409179, 1.678960],
 [0.630204, 1.501811, 0.000316],
 [0.289185, 1.156827, 0.705565],
 [1.050303, 0.099858, 0.101099],
 [0.200418, 0.271505, 1.143761]
]

These are numerical approximations of the NNLS solutions for each row (rounded to 6 decimal places).
