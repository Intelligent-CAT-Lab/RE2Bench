[THOUGHT]
We need to find which function "f" refers to in the provided code. The only (relevant) function named f is the inner function f(pointer) inside NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape.

That inner f does:
- If pointer is not an Iterable: return ([pointer], ())
- If len(pointer) == 0: return ([], (0,))
- Otherwise, it does elems, shapes = zip(*[f(i) for i in pointer]) — it recurses on each element of pointer.

The input pointer is the string: 'sin(x)**2 + "cos(x)"**2'.
- Strings in Python are Iterable, and len(pointer) > 0, so it will go to the recursive step.
- It will iterate over the characters of the string, calling f on each character (each a string of length 1).
- For a single-character string, the same logic applies: it's Iterable and len == 1, so it will recurse again on the same single character, and so on.
Thus the recursion never reaches the non-Iterable base case, causing unbounded recursion until Python's recursion limit is hit.

So the call results in a RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded (typically "maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object").
