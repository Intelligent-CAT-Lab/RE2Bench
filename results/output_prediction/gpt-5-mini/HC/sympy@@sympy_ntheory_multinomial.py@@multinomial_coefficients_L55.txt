- Call multinomial_coefficients(4, 2).
- m = 4, n = 2. The code checks: m >= 2*n and n > 1 -> 4 >= 4 and 2 > 1, so true. Therefore it returns dict(multinomial_coefficients_iterator(4, 2)).
- multinomial_coefficients_iterator builds mc from multinomial_coefficients(n, n) = multinomial_coefficients(2, 2). Since m==2 in that inner call, it returns binomial_coefficients(2) = {(0,2):1, (2,0):1, (1,1):2}. mc is then mapped by removing zeros from keys, giving mc = {(2,):1, (1,1):2}.
- The iterator yields all 4-tuples t summing to n=2 along with coefficients mc[filtered(t)]. These coefficients are the multinomial coefficients n!/(k1!...km!) for each tuple.
- For n=2, 2! = 2. Any tuple with a single 2 and rest zeros gives coefficient 1 (2/2 = 1). Any tuple with two 1's and two 0's gives coefficient 2 (2/(1*1) = 2).
- Therefore the coefficients for the listed tuples are:
  (2,0,0,0): 1
  (1,1,0,0): 2
  (0,2,0,0): 1
  (1,0,1,0): 2
  (0,1,1,0): 2
  (0,0,2,0): 1
  (1,0,0,1): 2
  (0,1,0,1): 2
  (0,0,1,1): 2
  (0,0,0,2): 1
