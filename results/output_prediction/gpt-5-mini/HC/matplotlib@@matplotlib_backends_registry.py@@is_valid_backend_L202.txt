[THOUGHT]
1. Input backend is "Agg".
2. is_valid_backend checks if backend starts with "module://". It does not, so backend is lowercased -> "agg".
3. It applies backwards_compat mapping, but "agg" is not a key there, so backend remains "agg".
4. It checks if backend is in _BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK or in self._backend_to_gui_framework. The builtin mapping contains the key "agg" (maps to "headless"), so this condition is True.
5. Therefore is_valid_backend returns True immediately (it does not need to load entry points).
