[THOUGHT]
1. The pattern string "sin(x*a_)**n_*cos(x*a_)**m_" sympifies to the product sin(x*a_)**n_ * cos(x*a_)**m_ where a_, n_, m_ are wildcards (Wild symbols).
2. We try to match this Mul-pattern against the expression cos(x).
3. To make the sin(...)**n_ factor disappear, set n_ = 0 (since anything**0 -> 1). Then the pattern reduces to cos(x*a_)**m_.
4. To match cos(x), set m_ = 1 and require x*a_ == x, so a_ = 1.
5. Therefore the match dictionary is {a_: 1, m_: 1, n_: 0}.
