[THOUGHT]
We run exptrigsimp on the expression "sinh(x) + cosh(x)".

1. exptrigsimp first applies bottom_up with exp_trig. exp_trig will detect HyperbolicFunction instances (sinh, cosh) and try their rewrite to exp. So sinh(x) -> (exp(x) - exp(-x))/2 and cosh(x) -> (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2.
2. After rewriting both terms to exponential form, the sum becomes:
   (exp(x) - exp(-x))/2 + (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2
   The -exp(-x) and +exp(-x) cancel, leaving (exp(x) + exp(x))/2 = 2*exp(x)/2 = exp(x).
3. The remaining steps in exptrigsimp operate on multiplicative factors and try to further simplify; the net result is the simplified expression exp(x). The function finally returns that expression.

So the output expression is exp(x).
