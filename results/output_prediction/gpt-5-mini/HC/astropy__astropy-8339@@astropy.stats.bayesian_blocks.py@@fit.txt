[THOUGHT]
We simulate the first steps of FitnessFunc.fit with the given inputs.

1. The method begins with:
   t, x, sigma = self.validate_input(t, x, sigma)

2. To call self.validate_input, the attribute validate_input must exist on self. The provided "self" JSON only contains keys "p0", "gamma", and "ncp_prior"; there is no validate_input attribute.

3. In Python, attempting to access self.validate_input when self is represented as a plain dict-like object will raise an AttributeError: "'dict' object has no attribute 'validate_input'".

Therefore the call fails immediately with an AttributeError, and no further computation in fit is executed.
