[THOUGHT]
We call ColumnTransformer.transform with the provided self state.

1. The first line in transform is check_is_fitted(self, 'transformers_').
   - In the provided self, "transformers_" is null (None), so check_is_fitted will detect that the estimator is not fitted and raise a NotFittedError.
   - The standard error message from check_is_fitted is:
     "This ColumnTransformer instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator."

2. Because the exception is raised at this first check, no further code in transform is executed and nothing is returned.

Therefore the result is the NotFittedError with the message above.
