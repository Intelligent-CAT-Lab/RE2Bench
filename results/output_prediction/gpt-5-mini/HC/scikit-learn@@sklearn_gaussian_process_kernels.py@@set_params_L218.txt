[THOUGHT]
1. set_params receives kwargs with two entries: "length_scale" and "length_scale_bounds".
2. It calls valid_params = self.get_params(deep=True). That will return a mapping of parameter names to their current values; given the input self, valid_params will contain the keys "length_scale" and "length_scale_bounds" (with current values 0.1... and [1e-05, 100000.0]).
3. The method iterates over the provided params. For each key there is no "__" in the name, so it follows the simple case.
4. For each key it checks that the key is present in valid_params (it is), then sets the attribute on self to the provided value.
5. After both assignments, self becomes:
   - length_scale: 0.11197917226857704
   - length_scale_bounds: [1e-05, 100000.0]
6. The method returns self (the updated object).

Therefore the returned object is the input self with the updated length_scale value.
