[THOUGHT]
1. Mul._eval_is_infinite calls _eval_is_zero_infinite_helper() to get (seen_zero, seen_infinite).
2. The helper initializes seen_zero = seen_infinite = False.
3. The Mul for "pi/2" has args: pi and 1/2 (a finite pi and a finite rational 1/2).
4. For each arg:
   - a.is_zero is False (not True or None), so the first if doesn't run.
   - a.is_infinite is False (not True or None), so the elif doesn't run.
   - In the else branch, checks for a.is_zero is None or a.is_infinite is None: both are False, so seen_zero and seen_infinite remain False.
5. After looping both args, helper returns (False, False).
6. Back in _eval_is_infinite: seen_infinite is False, so it returns False.

Therefore the result is false.
