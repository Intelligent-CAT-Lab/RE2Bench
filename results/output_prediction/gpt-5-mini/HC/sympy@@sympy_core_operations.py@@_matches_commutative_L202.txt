[THOUGHT]
We are matching the pattern sin(x*a_)**n_ * cos(x*a_)**m_ against the expression sin(x).

1. The pattern is a product of two factors: sin(x*a_)**n_ and cos(x*a_)**m_.
2. To match sin(x), the cos(...)**m_ factor must evaluate to 1 (i.e. be absent). That is achieved by setting m_ = 0 because cos(...)**0 == 1.
3. With m_ = 0, the pattern reduces to sin(x*a_)**n_ and must equal sin(x).
4. So sin(x*a_)**n_ == sin(x). The simplest solution is n_ = 1 and x*a_ == x, which gives a_ = 1.
5. Other exotic choices (e.g. a_ = -1 with some n_) do not produce exactly sin(x) because sin(-x) = -sin(x) and powers change sign or magnitude; the only straightforward consistent assignment is a_ = 1, n_ = 1, m_ = 0.

Therefore the matching assignments are a_ = 1, n_ = 1, m_ = 0.
