[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate Hlist.hpack(self, w=0.0, m='additional') with the given self.

Initial local vars:
- h = 0.0
- d = 0.0
- x = 0.0
- total_stretch and total_shrink are zero lists (not used because no Glue children)

Children (treated as Box-like because they have width/height/depth/shift_amount):
1) First child: width = 10.58, height = 13.00, depth = 0.00, shift_amount = 0.00
   - x += 10.58 -> x = 10.58
   - h = max(0.0, 13.00 - 0.00) = 13.00
   - d = max(0.0, 0.00 + 0.00) = 0.00

2) Second child: width = 8.08, height = 9.10, depth = 0.00, shift_amount = -7.00
   - x += 8.08 -> x = 18.66
   - h = max(13.00, 9.10 - (-7.00)) = max(13.00, 16.10) = 16.10
   - d = max(0.00, 0.00 + (-7.00)) = max(0.00, -7.00) = 0.00

After the loop:
- self.height is set to h = 16.10
- self.depth is set to d = 0.00
- since m == 'additional', w += x -> w = 0.0 + 18.66 = 18.66
- self.width = w = 18.66
- x = w - x = 18.66 - 18.66 = 0.0

Because x == 0.0, the method sets glue_sign = 0, glue_order = 0, glue_ratio = 0.0 and returns (no value).

Therefore the function returns None (null in JSON). The Hlist instance is mutated (width=18.66, height=16.10, depth=0.0), but the function output is None.
