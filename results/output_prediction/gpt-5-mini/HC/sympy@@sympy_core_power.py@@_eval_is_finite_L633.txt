[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Pow._eval_is_finite for self = cos(phi)**2.

1. exp is 2. Check self.exp.is_negative -> False (2 is not negative), so the first if-block is skipped.
2. Compute c1 = self.base.is_finite, i.e. (cos(phi)).is_finite. For a generic symbol phi, the finiteness of cos(phi) is not determined by assumptions, so c1 is None.
3. The code checks "if c1 is None: return" — so the method returns None (no explicit Boolean value).

Therefore the output is null (JSON) / None (Python).
