We need to simulate MiniBatchNMF._minibatch_step with the given inputs.

1. Determine regularization terms via _compute_regularization:
   - alpha_W = alpha_H = 0.0, l1_ratio = 0.0 -> l1_reg_W = l1_reg_H = l2_reg_W = l2_reg_H = 0.0.

2. fresh_restarts is False and W is not None, so we call _multiplicative_update_w with beta_loss == 2.
   - For beta_loss==2, numerator = X @ H.T (call it XHt).
   - Denominator uses HHt = H @ H.T and denominator = W @ HHt.
   - delta_W = numerator / denominator (elementwise), W <- W * delta_W.
   - I computed XHt (5x2) by row:
     row1 [10.142266, 47.996100]
     row2 [ 9.896663, 49.058585]
     row3 [ 9.651061, 50.121071]
     row4 [ 9.405458, 51.183556]
     row5 [ 9.159856, 52.246042]
   - HHt ≈ [[18.672522, 22.809382],
            [22.809382, 28.135506]]
   - For each W row i, denom_i = W_i @ HHt. Computing denom and delta = XHt / denom yields updated W (approx):
     W_new ≈
      [[0.24984, 0.92535],
       [0.3377 , 0.6375 ],
       [0.4780 , 0.13416],
       [0.1296 , 1.3548 ],
       [0.1343 , 1.3522 ]]

3. After updating W, since _beta_loss < 1 condition is irrelevant (beta_loss == 2), no additional clamping for W.

4. Compute batch_cost:
   - For beta_loss == 2, _beta_divergence(X, W_new, H, 2) = squared_norm(X - W_new @ H) / 2.
   - Compute WH = W_new @ H (each row: [w0*h00 + w1*h10, w0*h01 + w1*h11]); I computed approximate WH rows:
     WH ≈
      [[1.13784, 5.87445],
       [0.97610, 4.73560],
       [0.67760, 2.69039],
       [1.39130, 7.61760],
       [1.39480, 7.62380]]
   - Residuals X - WH and squared norms per row:
     row1: [2.86216, 0.12555] -> sum squares ≈ 8.2088
     row2: [2.02390, 2.26440] -> sum squares ≈ 9.2236
     row3: [1.32240, 5.30961] -> sum squares ≈ 29.9466
     row4: [-0.39130, 1.38240] -> sum squares ≈ 2.0651
     row5: [-1.39480, 2.37620] -> sum squares ≈ 7.5921
   - Total squared norm ≈ 57.0362, so beta_divergence = 57.0362 / 2 = 28.5181.
   - batch_size = X.shape[0] = 5, so batch_cost = 28.5181 / 5 ≈ 5.70362.

5. Since update_H is True, H would be updated afterward, but batch_cost is computed before H update and is the returned value.

Final returned value (approx): 5.70362
