[THOUGHT]
We run MigrationWriter.as_string with self.migration.operations == None.

Inside as_string:
- items initialized.
- imports = set()
- operations = []
- The code then attempts: for operation in self.migration.operations:
  But self.migration.operations is None, which is not iterable.
- Iterating over None raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
- The function does not catch this exception, so the call to as_string will raise that TypeError and will not return a normal string.

Thus the output is the raised exception message: "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable".
