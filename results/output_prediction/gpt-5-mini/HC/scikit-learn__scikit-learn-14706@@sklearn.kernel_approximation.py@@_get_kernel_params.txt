We call _get_kernel_params on self with:
- kernel = "polynomial" (a string, not callable, not 'precomputed')
- kernel_params = None
- gamma = None
- coef0 = 0.1
- degree = 3.1

Step-by-step:
1. params = self.kernel_params -> None.
2. Since params is None, set params = {}.
3. kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed', so iterate over KERNEL_PARAMS['polynomial']. That list contains the parameter names for the polynomial kernel (typically ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']).
4. For each param:
   - 'gamma': getattr(self, 'gamma') is None, so skip.
   - 'coef0': getattr(self, 'coef0') is 0.1 (not None), so set params['coef0'] = 0.1.
   - 'degree': getattr(self, 'degree') is 3.1 (not None), so set params['degree'] = 3.1.
5. Return params, which is {'coef0': 0.1, 'degree': 3.1}.

No exceptions are raised because kernel is a string and not 'precomputed', and although gamma is None, coef0 and degree are provided.
