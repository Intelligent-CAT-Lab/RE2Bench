[THOUGHT]
1. OneHotEncoder.transform is called with X = None.
2. transform first calls check_is_fitted(self). Assuming the estimator is considered fitted (it has n_features_in_), execution proceeds.
3. transform then calls self._transform(X, ...). Inside _transform the first steps are:
   - self._check_feature_names(X, reset=False)
   - self._check_n_features(X, reset=False)
4. In _check_n_features, it calls _num_features(X). With X = None, _num_features raises a TypeError: "Unable to find the number of features from X of type NoneType" because None has neither __len__ nor shape nor __array__.
5. _check_n_features catches this TypeError. Since reset=False and the estimator has attribute n_features_in_ (value 2), _check_n_features raises a ValueError with the message:
   "X does not contain any features, but OneHotEncoder is expecting 2 features"
6. Therefore transform raises this ValueError and does not return a normal array.

So the result is a ValueError with that message.
