[THOUGHT]
1. dmp_sub is called with u = 0, so the branch "if not u" is taken.
2. It returns _dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K)).
3. _dup is the identity, so we call dup_sub(f = [], g = [], K = "ZZ").
4. In dup_sub, "if not f" is True (f is empty), so it returns dup_neg(g, K). Here g is [].
5. The negation of an empty (zero) dense polynomial is still an empty list, so dup_neg([]) yields [].
6. _dmp is the identity, so the final returned value is [].
