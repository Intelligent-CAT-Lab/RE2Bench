[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Pow._eval_is_rational for self = cos(phi)**2.

1. First if:
   - self.exp.is_integer -> True (exp is 2).
   - self.base.is_rational -> not True (cos(phi) is not known to be rational; None/False), so the whole if-condition fails.

2. p = self.func(*self.as_base_exp()) reconstructs the same Pow object p = cos(phi)**2. p.is_Pow is True, so we continue.

3. b, e = p.as_base_exp() gives b = cos(phi), e = 2.

4. Check: if e.is_Rational and b.is_Rational:
   - e.is_Rational -> True (2 is rational)
   - b.is_Rational -> not True (cos(phi) is not known rational)
   => condition fails.

5. e.is_integer -> True, so enter that block:
   - if b.is_rational: false/unknown, skip.
   - elif b.is_irrational: also unknown (None), so that branch does not return.

6. b is not S.Exp1, so final check doesn't apply.

No branch returns a boolean, so the method returns None.
