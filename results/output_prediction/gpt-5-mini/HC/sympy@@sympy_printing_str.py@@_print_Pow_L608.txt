[THOUGHT]
- _print_Pow is called with expr representing sqrt(2): expr.exp is S.Half and rational is False.
- The first if branch checks "if expr.exp is S.Half and (not rational)" — this is true, so it returns "sqrt(%s)" % self._print(expr.base).
- expr.base is the integer 2; StrPrinter._print will print that as "2".
- Therefore the overall returned string is "sqrt(2)".
