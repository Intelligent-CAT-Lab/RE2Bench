[THOUGHT]
1. The method resolved by the input is sympy.sympy.core.expr.as_real_imag.
2. It returns (re(self), im(self)) unless hints.get('ignore') == self. No 'ignore' hint is provided.
3. For the expression 2*pi, re(2*pi) is 2*pi (it's purely real) and im(2*pi) is 0.
4. Therefore the result is the tuple (2*pi, 0).
