[THOUGHT]
1. The input expr string "2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2)" is first passed to sympify, producing the SymPy expression 2*x/(a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2).
2. factor_terms calls the inner function do on that expression.
3. The denominator a**2*x**2 - a**2*y**2 has a common factor a**2, and x**2 - y**2 further factors as (x - y)*(x + y). So the denominator becomes a**2*(x - y)*(x + y).
4. There is no cancellation with the numerator x, so the overall simplified (factored) form is 2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y)).
5. factor_terms returns that SymPy expression, which is represented as the string "2*x/(a**2*(x - y)*(x + y))".
