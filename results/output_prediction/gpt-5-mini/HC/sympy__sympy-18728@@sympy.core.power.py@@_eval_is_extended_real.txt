[THOUGHT]
We attempt to execute Pow._eval_is_extended_real with "self" given as an empty dict ({}).

Looking at the method, the very first attribute access is:
    real_b = self.base.is_extended_real

Accessing self.base on a plain dict will raise an AttributeError, because a dict has no attribute 'base'. Therefore the method does not proceed further and an AttributeError is raised with message: "'dict' object has no attribute 'base'".

So the result of calling the method with the provided input is that an AttributeError is raised; there is no normal return value.
