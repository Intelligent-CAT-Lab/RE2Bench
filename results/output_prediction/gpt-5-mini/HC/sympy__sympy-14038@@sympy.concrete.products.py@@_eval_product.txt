[THOUGHT]
We evaluate Product._eval_product(term, limits) with term = 1 + n**(-2/3) and limits corresponding to a product over n from 1 to oo (so k = n, a = 1, n = oo).

Step-by-step:
- Unpack limits: k = n (the index symbol), a = 1, n = oo.
- Check if k not in term.free_symbols: false, because term contains n.
- Check if a == n: false (1 != oo).
- Check for KroneckerDelta: term has none.
- Compute dif = n - a = oo - 1 = oo; dif.is_Integer is False.
- Check term.is_polynomial(k): term = 1 + n**(-2/3) is not a polynomial in n (exponent -2/3), so False.
- term.is_Add is True, so factor_terms(term, fraction=True) is attempted. factor_terms of 1 + n**(-2/3) will remain an Add (not a Mul), so factored.is_Mul is False.
- None of the other branches (Mul, Pow, nested Product) apply.

Thus the function does not return any concrete value in these branches and falls through, returning None (i.e., no simplification possible).

Therefore the output is null in JSON (None in Python).
