[THOUGHT]
We run ContinuousBase._setup with the given input.

1. Copy self: new starts with the same fields as input (values: null, norm: null, trans: "log", _tick_params: null, _label_params: null, _legend: null).
2. The code checks new._tick_params is None and would call new.tick() to populate tick params. The implementation of tick() is not provided, so we cannot determine concrete locator/at/upto/etc values. I'll represent those unknowns as null.
3. Similarly new._label_params is None and would be set by new.label(); we don't know the exact formatter/like/unit values, so represent them as null, with base as an empty object because the structure expects an object there.
4. The transform (forward, inverse) and mpl scale creation call new._get_transform() and new._get_scale(...). Implementations are not provided; we cannot produce concrete callable objects. The PseudoAxis/mpl scale details are likewise unspecified. I will set the transform-related subfields to empty objects except for _shorthand_name which derives from the scale type "log" (taken from self.trans), so I set that to "log"; _invalid is unknown so set to null.
5. prop.normed is not provided in the input prop object, so treat it as False (no normalization). That makes normalize = None (represented as null).
6. prop.get_mapping(new, data) is not provided; unknown, so represent as null.
7. new._pipeline is composed of [axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]. All four entries are unknown or None, so represent each as null.
8. new._legend remains null because prop.legend is not provided (assumed False).

Given the missing implementations, I use null for unknown callables/values and preserve given known values (trans = "log"). The _spacer is a function assigned in the code; its concrete callable cannot be represented, so represent it as an empty object as requested by the structure.

Based on these decisions, the filled output is below.
