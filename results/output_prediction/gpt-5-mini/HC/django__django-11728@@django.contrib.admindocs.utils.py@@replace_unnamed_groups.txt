[THOUGHT]
1. The function finds all '(' characters via unnamed_group_matcher. The pattern is "^a/?$".
2. There are no '(' characters in "^a/?$", so unnamed_group_indices is an empty list.
3. Because there are no group indices, group_start_end_indices stays empty and the function takes the else branch.
4. The function returns the original pattern unchanged.
