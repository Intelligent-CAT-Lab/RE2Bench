[THOUGHT]
We execute _compute_n_features_outs:

- It builds output = [len(cats) for cats in self.categories_].
- self.categories_ is a list with one element: the string "['a', 'b']".
- Iterating, cats is that string. len("['a', 'b']") = 10 (characters: [, ', a, ', ,, space, ', b, ', ]).
- So output = [10].
- _drop_idx_after_grouping is None, so no adjustment.
- _infrequent_enabled is False, so the method returns output immediately.

Thus the returned value is [10].
