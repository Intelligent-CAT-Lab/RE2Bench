1. transform calls check_is_fitted(self) — assume the estimator is fitted (no exception).
2. _build_cache() sees self._cached_dict is None and builds mapping from self.classes_ (array([0,1,2])) to indices: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}.
3. _transform iterates over the 25 samples in y, creating a row with ones at the indices mapped from each sample's labels:
   - Sample 1: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 2: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 3: [0,1,2] -> [1,1,1]
   - Sample 4: [0,1,2] -> [1,1,1]
   - Sample 5: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 6: [0,1] -> [1,1,0]
   - Sample 7: [] -> [0,0,0]
   - Sample 8: [0] -> [1,0,0]
   - Sample 9: [2] -> [0,0,1]
   - Sample 10: [] -> [0,0,0]
   - Sample 11: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 12: [] -> [0,0,0]
   - Sample 13: [1,2] -> [0,1,1]
   - Sample 14: [0] -> [1,0,0]
   - Sample 15: [0,1] -> [1,1,0]
   - Sample 16: [0,1,2] -> [1,1,1]
   - Sample 17: [] -> [0,0,0]
   - Sample 18: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 19: [] -> [0,0,0]
   - Sample 20: [0,1,2] -> [1,1,1]
   - Sample 21: [1,2] -> [0,1,1]
   - Sample 22: [2] -> [0,0,1]
   - Sample 23: [0,2] -> [1,0,1]
   - Sample 24: [1] -> [0,1,0]
   - Sample 25: [1] -> [0,1,0]
4. Because sparse_output is False, the CSR matrix is converted to a dense ndarray.
5. The returned output is a (25 x 3) array with the rows shown above.
