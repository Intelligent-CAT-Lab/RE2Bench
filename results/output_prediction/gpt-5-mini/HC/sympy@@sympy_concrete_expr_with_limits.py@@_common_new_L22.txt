[THOUGHT]
I'll walk through _common_new with the given inputs.

1. sympify(function): function is the string "1", so sympify("1") -> the SymPy integer 1.
2. The function is not an Equality and not S.NaN, so continue.
3. symbols were provided (x), so call _process_limits(*symbols, discrete=False).
   - The symbol is a plain integration symbol x, so _process_limits returns limits = [Tuple(x)] and orientation = 1.
4. The loop that substitutes provided fixed-end limits (len == 4) does nothing because the single limit is length 1.
5. The while cls == type(function) check compares Integral class with the type of function (Integer) — they differ, so skip that loop.
6. reps = {} because there are no Piecewise atoms in the function 1.
7. piecewise_fold(1) returns 1, xreplace with empty reps does nothing.
8. Finally the function returns the tuple (function, limits, orientation) i.e. (1, (x,), 1).

So the output is the tuple (1, (x,), 1). I will represent that as the string "(1, (x,), 1)" in the JSON output below.
