[THOUGHT]
- The function is called with expr = "log(2)" (a string), deep=True, force=False, factor=False.
- Because factor is False, the code defines _handleMul and then does expr = expr.replace(..., _handleMul). In the intended usage expr would be a SymPy Basic and .replace would try to transform Mul nodes, but the expression contains no Mul to handle, so no change is required.
- Ultimately the function returns sympify(expr).expand(..., log=True, ...). Sympifying "log(2)" yields the SymPy object log(2).
- Expanding log(2) with the given flags does not change it, so the final result is log(2).
