[THOUGHT]
We need to follow _expand_partial_derivative. It first calls self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables) which internally calls TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices on a list containing only expr when no variables are present. For a non-TensExpr expr, get_indices returns (), so TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices produces:
- args unchanged (a single elem list containing expr),
- indices = [],
- free = [],
- dum = [].

_back in_ _expand_partial_derivative, obj._indices, obj._free, obj._dum are set to these values (empty lists). None of the later branches change these attributes before the method returns (the method may return S.Zero or compute result, but the attributes have been set to the empty lists). Therefore the resulting _indices, _free, and _dum are all empty lists.
