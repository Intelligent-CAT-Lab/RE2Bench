[THOUGHT]
We run make_blobs with:
- random_state = 0
- n_samples = 50 (an integer)
- n_features = 2
- centers is given as the string "[[ 0.  0.]\n [ 1.  1.]\n [ 0.  1.]]"
- cluster_std is given as the string "[ 0.05  0.2   0.4 ]"

Step-by-step:

1. generator = check_random_state(random_state)
   - check_random_state is called with seed=0 and returns a numpy RandomState(0). (This prints a call trace line in the helper, but that is a side-effect; the function returns an RNG.)

2. Since n_samples is an integer and centers is not None, the code goes into the branch that expects centers to be array-like (not an integer).
   - It calls centers = check_array(centers). Here centers is a Python string (the textual representation of an array).

3. Inside check_array:
   - It tries to convert the input into a numpy array with dtype determined by the function (dtype ends up as None).
   - np.array(centers) where centers is a string yields a 0-dimensional numpy array (a scalar string), i.e. an array with ndim == 0.
   - Because ensure_2d is True by default, check_array checks array.ndim and finds 0, so it raises a ValueError with the message:
     "Expected 2D array, got scalar array instead:
     array=... .
     Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample."

Thus make_blobs does not complete normally; it raises a ValueError from check_array because centers was passed as a scalar string rather than an array-like 2D structure.

The exact ValueError message (with the string-form of the provided centers) is:
Expected 2D array, got scalar array instead:
array=[[ 0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.]
 [ 0.  1.]].
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
