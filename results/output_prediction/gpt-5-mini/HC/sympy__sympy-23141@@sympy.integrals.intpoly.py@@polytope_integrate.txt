[THOUGHT]
- Call polytope_integrate(poly={}, expr="x*y", clockwise=True).
- The function starts with: if clockwise: ...
- It checks isinstance(poly, Polygon). Here poly is a plain dict ({}), so isinstance(...) is False.
- Therefore the function raises a TypeError with the message:
  "clockwise=True works for only 2-PolytopeV-representation input".
- No other code is executed; the function does not return a value but raises that exception.
