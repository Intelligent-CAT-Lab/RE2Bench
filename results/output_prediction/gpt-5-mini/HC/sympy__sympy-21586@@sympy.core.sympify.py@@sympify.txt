[THOUGHT]
1. sympify is called with a = "2500/pi" and strict = True.
2. The initial checks for __sympy__, converter entries, numpy instances, and _sympy_ all do not apply for a plain string, so the function proceeds to the parsing stage.
3. The code uses the sympy parser (parse_expr) with the given transformations (convert_xor etc.). rational is False, so no rationalize transform is added.
4. The string has no newlines, so a.replace('\n','') leaves it as "2500/pi".
5. parse_expr("2500/pi", ...) returns the SymPy expression representing 2500 divided by pi.
6. sympify returns that expression object; its canonical string form is "2500/pi".

Therefore the output value is the SymPy expression "2500/pi".
