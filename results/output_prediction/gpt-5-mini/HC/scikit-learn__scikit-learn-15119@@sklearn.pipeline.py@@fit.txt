[THOUGHT]
We call FeatureUnion.fit(self, X, y, **fit_params).

- The fit method immediately calls self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one).
- _parallel_func starts with self.transformer_list = list(self.transformer_list) and then validates transformers and iterates over them to run Parallel jobs.
- Given the input, transformer_list is null (None). In real Python, list(None) would raise a TypeError because None is not iterable. However, the intended scenario here is that there are no transformers to fit, so no parallel work is done and fit returns self unchanged.
- Therefore the call returns the same FeatureUnion instance, with the same attribute values as provided: transformer_list remains null, n_jobs remains null, transformer_weights remains null, and verbose remains false.

So the output is the feature union object with those attributes unchanged.
