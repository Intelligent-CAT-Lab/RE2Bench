[THOUGHT]
We run Mul._eval_is_zero_infinite_helper on self = -pi/4.

- Initialize seen_zero = seen_infinite = False.
- Iterate over factors in self.args. The factors of -pi/4 are numeric/non-infinite: -1, pi, and Rational(1,4) (or equivalently -pi and 1/4). For each factor a:
  - a.is_zero is False (none of these factors is zero).
  - a.is_infinite is False (pi is finite, rationals and integers are finite).
  - Thus neither of the branches that set seen_zero or seen_infinite to None are taken.
- After the loop, seen_zero and seen_infinite remain False.

So the method returns the tuple (False, False).
