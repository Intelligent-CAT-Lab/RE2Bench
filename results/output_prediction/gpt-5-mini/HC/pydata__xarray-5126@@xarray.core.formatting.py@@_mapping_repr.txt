[THOUGHT]
1. _mapping_repr is called with mapping={"foo": "bar"}, title="Attributes", summarizer={} (a dict), expand_option_name="display_expand_attrs", and col_width and max_rows default to None.
2. col_width is None so _calculate_col_width(mapping) is called.
   - Iterating mapping yields its keys; the longest key string length is len("foo") = 3.
   - _calculate_col_width returns max(3, 7) + 6 = 13, so col_width = 13.
3. max_rows is None so it's set to OPTIONS['display_max_rows'] (some integer). mapping has length 1, so len_mapping = 1.
4. _get_boolean_with_default(expand_option_name, default=True) is called; assuming OPTIONS value is 'default' (typical), it returns True, so we do not collapse the mapping.
5. Because len_mapping (1) is not > max_rows, the code enters the else branch and attempts to build summary by calling summarizer(k, v, col_width) for each item in mapping.
6. summarizer is a dict ({}), not a callable; attempting to call it raises a TypeError: "'dict' object is not callable".
7. Therefore _mapping_repr raises a TypeError with message "'dict' object is not callable".

The function does not return normally; it raises a TypeError.
