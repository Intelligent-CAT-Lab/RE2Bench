[THOUGHT]
1. _get_metadata_request checks if self has attribute '_metadata_request'. The input provides a '_metadata_request' (a string), so the if branch is taken.
2. It calls get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request). The argument is a plain string, which does not have get_metadata_routing and does not have a _type indicating it's already a MetadataRequest/Router.
3. According to get_routing_for_object, for such an object it returns a new empty MetadataRequest(owner=None).
4. MetadataRequest.__init__ will set owner=None and create MethodMetadataRequest attributes for each method in SIMPLE_METHODS, but the returned value is simply the MetadataRequest instance with owner None.
5. Therefore _get_metadata_request returns a MetadataRequest object whose owner is None.

So the output is a MetadataRequest instance with owner=None (represented here as "MetadataRequest(owner=None)").
