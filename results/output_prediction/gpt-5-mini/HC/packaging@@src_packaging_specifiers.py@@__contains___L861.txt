[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate SpecifierSet.__contains__ which calls contains(item).

1. Interpret inputs:
   - self._specs is given as "frozenset()". This represents an empty frozenset (i.e., no specifiers). Treat it as empty -> falsy in boolean context.
   - self._prereleases is True.
   - item is "<Version('1.0a1')>" which represents a Version instance for 1.0a1 (a prerelease). _coerce_version(item) will return that Version object whose is_prerelease is True.

2. contains starts:
   - version = _coerce_version(item) -> a Version(1.0a1) (not None).
   - installed is not passed so skip that branch.

3. contains calls self.filter([version], prereleases=None).
   - Inside filter, prereleases is None and self.prereleases is not None, so prereleases becomes self.prereleases -> True.
   - Since self._specs is empty (falsy), the code goes to the else branch:
       - if prereleases is True: return iter(iterable)
     So filter returns an iterator that yields the provided version.

4. contains returns bool(list(iterator)) -> list contains the version, so bool(...) is True.

Therefore __contains__ evaluates to True.
