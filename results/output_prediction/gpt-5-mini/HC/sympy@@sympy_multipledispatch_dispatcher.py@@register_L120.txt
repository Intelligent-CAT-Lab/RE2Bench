[THOUGHT]
1. The register method is called with one positional argument (a type) and no kwargs.
2. register defines and returns a nested function _ (the decorator) that takes func, calls self.add(types, func, **kwargs), and returns func.
3. Therefore, calling register(...) returns this nested function object (the decorator). Its exact memory address is not specified, so represent it by its function representation: "<function Dispatcher.register.<locals>._>".
