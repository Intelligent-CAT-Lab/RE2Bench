[THOUGHT]
We call _safe_repr with object = "dictionary" (a Python str), context = {"124132985094608": 1}, maxlevels = None, level = 1, changed_only = True.

Step-by-step:
1. typ = type(object) -> <class 'str'>.
2. The function first checks if typ in pprint._builtin_scalars. Strings are included in pprint._builtin_scalars, so this condition is True.
3. It returns (repr(object), True, False). repr("dictionary") yields the string "'dictionary'" (with single quotes).
4. Therefore the returned tuple is ("'dictionary'", True, False).

Representing that as JSON, the tuple becomes an array: ["'dictionary'", true, false].
