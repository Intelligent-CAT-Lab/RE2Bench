We need to simulate LutBuilder.build_lut.

- build_default_lut sets self.lut[i] = 1 when the center bit (1<<4 == 16) is set in i, else 0. So initially half the entries (those with center bit = 1) are 1.
- The two input patterns are "4:(... .1. .0.)->0" and "4:(... .1. ..0)->0". After removing spaces they become:
  - s0 = "....1..0."  (center at index 4 = '1', explicit '0' at index 7)
  - t0 = "....1...0"  (center at index 4 = '1', explicit '0' at index 8)
- The '4' option rotates each basic pattern by 90° steps, producing patterns that require the center bit = 1 and require a 0 at each of the 4 orthogonal neighbor positions (from s0 rotations) and at each of the 4 diagonal neighbor positions (from t0 rotations).
- Together, these patterns cover all 8 neighbors. For any entry where center bit = 1 and at least one neighbor bit = 0, at least one compiled pattern will match and set self.lut[i] = 0.
- Therefore the only index that remains set to 1 is the one where center bit = 1 and all 8 neighbors are 1 — i.e., all 9 bits are 1 → binary 0b111111111 = decimal 511.
- The final LUT is a bytearray of length LUT_SIZE (512) with 0 for every index except index 511 which is 1.

So the returned bytearray is 511 zeros followed by a single 1 at the last position (index 511).
