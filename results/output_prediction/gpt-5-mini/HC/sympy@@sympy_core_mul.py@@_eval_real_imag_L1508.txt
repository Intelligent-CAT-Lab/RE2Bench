[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate Mul._eval_real_imag with self = 11*pi/6 and real=True.

- 11*pi/6 is a Mul with args (11, pi, 1/6).
- Initialize zero = False, t_not_re_im = None.
- For each factor t:
  - Integers, pi, and Rational(1,6) all have is_extended_real True, are not imaginary, and are not zero.
  - For each such t the code sets z = t.is_zero (False). The branch sets zero = z (remains False).
  - No factor triggers the other branches (no factor is imaginary, not-extended-real, or infinite).
- After the loop t_not_re_im is still None and zero is False, so the code reaches "elif zero is False: return real".
- Since real was passed as True, the function returns True.
