[THOUGHT]
1. add_attrs_init calls _make_init_script(...) to produce (script, globs, annotations).
2. It then defines an inner function _attach_attrs_init that takes cls_dict and globs and sets cls_dict['__attrs_init__'] to the generated init and attaches annotations.
3. It appends the tuple (script, globs, _attach_attrs_init) to self._script_snippets.
4. Finally, add_attrs_init returns self.

Given the provided input, we don't need the actual contents of the generated script/globs/annotations to determine the return value: the method returns the same object (self). Therefore the output is the input self object represented as JSON.
