[THOUGHT]
- X is the 2x2 array of ones, so n_samples = 2, n_features = 2.
- self.init is None (not 'custom'), and update_H is True, so the code takes the final else branch.
- Because self._n_components == 'auto', it is set to X.shape[1] = 2.
- _initialize_nmf is called with X and n_components=2 and init=None.
- Inside _initialize_nmf, init None and n_components <= min(n_samples, n_features) => init becomes 'nndsvda'.
- NNDSVD initialization on a 2x2 all-ones matrix yields first singular triplet giving W[:,0] = [1., 1.] and H[0,:] = [1., 1.]; the second components correspond to singular value 0 and produce zeros.
- For 'nndsvda', zeros in W and H are filled with the average of X, which is 1.0. Therefore both W and H become 2x2 matrices of all ones.
- _check_w_h returns the tuple (W, H), each being [[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]].
