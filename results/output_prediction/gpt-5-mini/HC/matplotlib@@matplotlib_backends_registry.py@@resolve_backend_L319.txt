[THOUGHT]
1. The input backend is the string "agg". It's a str and lowercased stays "agg".
2. The method looks up gui = self._BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK.get("agg") or self._backend_to_gui_framework.get("agg").
3. In the built-in mapping, "agg" maps to "headless", so gui = "headless".
4. Since gui == "headless", the function returns (backend, None).
5. Therefore the returned value is the tuple ("agg", None), represented in JSON as ["agg", null].
