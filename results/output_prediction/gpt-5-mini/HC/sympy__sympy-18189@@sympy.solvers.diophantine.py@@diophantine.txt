[THOUGHT]
The diophantine function expects a SymPy expression (or Eq); here eq is given as a plain string "8*x*y + z**2".

Inside diophantine it does:
- if isinstance(eq, Eq): ... (not the case)
- then it tries: var = list(eq.expand(force=True).free_symbols)

But eq is a str, so calling eq.expand(...) raises an AttributeError. That AttributeError is caught by the except (GeneratorsNeeded, AssertionError, AttributeError) clause, which then raises a TypeError with the message "Equation should be a polynomial with Rational coefficients."

Therefore the call results in a TypeError being raised with that message.
