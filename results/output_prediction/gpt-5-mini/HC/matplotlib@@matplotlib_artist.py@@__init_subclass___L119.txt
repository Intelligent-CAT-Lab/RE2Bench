[THOUGHT]
We simulate Artist.__init_subclass__(cls):

1. The method starts by checking if not hasattr(cls.draw, '_supports_rasterization'):
   - For a freshly created subclass, the inherited draw method will not have the attribute '_supports_rasterization', so this condition is True.
   - It therefore replaces cls.draw with _prevent_rasterization(cls.draw). That wrapper function has attribute _supports_rasterization set to False.

2. Next it checks if not hasattr(cls.set, '_autogenerated_signature'):
   - For a typical subclass that hasn't had its set signature autogenerated, this attribute will be missing, so the condition is True.
   - The method then returns early (no further changes are made).

3. The function ends without an explicit return, so it returns None.

Therefore the result of calling __init_subclass__ is None (JSON null).
