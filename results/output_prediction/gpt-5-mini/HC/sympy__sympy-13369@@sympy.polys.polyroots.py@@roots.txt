[THOUGHT]
The function roots is defined as def roots(f, *gens, **flags): — it requires at least one positional argument f. The provided call supplies no positional arguments. In Python this results in a TypeError indicating the required positional argument 'f' is missing.

{
    "0": "TypeError: roots() missing 1 required positional argument: 'f'"
}
