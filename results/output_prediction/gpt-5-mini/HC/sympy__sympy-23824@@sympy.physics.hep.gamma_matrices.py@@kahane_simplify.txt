[THOUGHT]
1. kahane_simplify first checks types: it's designed to operate on TensMul; given the provided object has tensor-related internals (_ext_rank, _rank, _coeff, etc.), it will reach the TensMul handling (the earlier isinstance checks for Mul, TensAdd, Tensor do not match).
2. The function collects "gammas = expression.args" and inspects dummy contractions via expression.dum. The provided input has no dummy list (dum is null/empty) and likewise no free indices.
3. The code builds a local variable dum by filtering expression.dum for LorentzIndex-typed entries; since there are no dummy contractions, len(dum) == 0.
4. The function contains: if len(dum) == 0: return expression. Therefore the function returns the input expression unchanged.
5. So every reported attribute stays the same as in the input.
