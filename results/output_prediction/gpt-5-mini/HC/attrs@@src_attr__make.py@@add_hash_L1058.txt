[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate _ClassBuilder.add_hash.

- add_hash calls _make_hash_script(self._cls, self._attrs, frozen=self._frozen, cache_hash=self._cache_hash) to obtain (script, globs).
- It then defines attach_hash (a closure) and appends the tuple (script, globs, attach_hash) to self._script_snippets.
- Finally it returns self.

Given the provided "self" value only contains the keys "auto_attribs", "these", and "has_custom_setattr". The crucial fact for the output is that add_hash returns the same object (self). We therefore predict the function returns the same object passed in as "self" (no other visible transformation is requested in the output structure).

So the output is the original self object (unchanged in the representation we have).
