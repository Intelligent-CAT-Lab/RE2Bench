[THOUGHT]
- The GridSpecBase.__getitem__ is called with self having _nrows=1, _ncols=1 and key equal to the list [0, 0].
- Inside __getitem__, get_geometry() returns (1, 1).
- The method tests isinstance(key, tuple). The provided key is a list, not a tuple, so that branch is not taken.
- It then calls the local _normalize(key, nrows * ncols, None) with key=[0,0], size=1, axis=None.
- In _normalize, since key is not a slice, execution reaches the numeric branch which attempts to evaluate "if key < 0:". Comparing a list to an int raises a TypeError in Python.
- The specific error message raised is: "'<' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'".
- Therefore __getitem__ does not return a SubplotSpec; it raises a TypeError with that message.
