[THOUGHT]
- _hstack checks self.sparse_output_. Here self["sparse_output_"] is False, so it enters the non-sparse branch.
- The first line in that branch is a list comprehension: Xs = [f.toarray() if sparse.issparse(f) else f for f in Xs]
- That comprehension attempts to iterate over Xs, but the provided args give Xs = null (which maps to Python None).
- Iterating over None in Python raises a TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not iterable".
- Therefore _hstack will raise a TypeError and will not return a normal array.
