[THOUGHT]
1. prepare_url receives url = "http://localhost:49515/" and params = {}.
2. url is already a str; lstrip() leaves it unchanged.
3. The ':' check is skipped because the URL starts with "http".
4. parse_url("http://localhost:49515/") yields scheme='http', host='localhost', port=49515, path='/' (and empty query/fragment).
5. host is ASCII and valid, so netloc becomes "localhost:49515".
6. params is an empty dict. _encode_params({}) returns an empty string (no encoded parameters), so enc_params is falsey and query remains as parsed (empty).
7. urlunparse([scheme, netloc, path, None, query, fragment]) produces "http://localhost:49515/".
8. requote_uri leaves that unchanged. self.url is set to "http://localhost:49515/".
9. The method has no return statement, so it returns None.

Therefore the function call's return value is null (JSON).
