We execute BaseForest._compute_oob_predictions with the provided inputs.

1. Convert X if sparse: X is a CSC sparse matrix, so X = X.tocsr() — shape remains (150, 20).
2. n_samples = y.shape[0] = 150.
3. n_outputs = self.n_outputs_ = 1.
4. is_classifier(self) returns True and self has n_classes_ = [2], so
   oob_pred_shape = (n_samples, n_classes_[0], n_outputs) = (150, 2, 1).
   oob_pred is initialized as an array of zeros with dtype float64 and shape (150, 2, 1).
   n_oob_pred is initialized as zeros with shape (150, 1), dtype int64.
5. n_samples_bootstrap = _get_n_samples_bootstrap(150, self.max_samples) -> max_samples is None so returns 150.
6. Loop over the 40 estimators in self.estimators_:
   - For each estimator, unsampled_indices = _generate_unsampled_indices(estimator.random_state, 150, 150).
     This returns the indices not selected in that estimator's bootstrap sample (a subset of {0..149}).
     The exact unsampled indices depend on each estimator's random_state and the internal RNG; we cannot deterministically derive them here from the provided strings.
   - y_pred = self._get_oob_predictions(estimator, X[unsampled_indices, :])
     This returns predicted class-probabilities for the unsampled rows: an array shaped (len(unsampled_indices), n_classes, n_outputs) -> (m, 2, 1).
   - oob_pred[unsampled_indices, ...] += y_pred
   - n_oob_pred[unsampled_indices, :] += 1
   After all 40 estimators, oob_pred contains the sum of probability vectors from all trees that left each sample out; n_oob_pred contains the count of OOB predictions per sample.
7. For k in range(n_outputs) (only k=0):
   - If any n_oob_pred == 0, those entries are set to 1 after emitting a warning (to avoid division by zero).
   - oob_pred[..., k] /= n_oob_pred[..., [k]]  -> divide summed probabilities by counts to get the mean probability per class for each sample.

Result:
- oob_pred is a numpy.ndarray of dtype float64 with shape (150, 2, 1).
- Each entry oob_pred[i, :, 0] holds the averaged OOB predicted class-probabilities for sample i over all trees that left sample i out.
- Exact numeric values are not determinable from the given summarized estimator representations and inputs, because they depend on the trees' predictions and exact unsampled index sets per random_state.

Therefore the correct description of the returned value is: a numpy.ndarray of shape (150, 2, 1), dtype float64, containing per-sample averaged OOB class-probabilities (values not concretely specified here).
