[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives expr = "n + n**(-n)" as a string.
2. simplify starts by calling expr = sympify(expr). This converts the string to a SymPy expression Add(n, n**(-n)).
3. The code attempts to call expr._eval_simplify(...). For this expression there is no further algebraic simplification performed that changes its form, so the function falls through the subsequent steps without changing the expression.
4. No transformations apply that would rewrite n + n**(-n) to a different, simpler form.
5. Therefore simplify returns the same expression: n + n**(-n).
