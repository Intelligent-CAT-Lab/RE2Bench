[THOUGHT]
We simulate _BaseVoting.fit with the provided inputs.

1. The method begins by checking:
   if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
       raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')

2. In the input, self["estimators"] is null (i.e. None). Therefore the condition is True and an AttributeError is raised immediately.

3. Because the exception is raised at the start of fit, none of the later code runs and no new attributes such as estimators_ or named_estimators_ are created/modified. The instance state remains as given in the input.

Thus the observable state remains the same values as provided; estimators_ was not set, so we represent it as null. The provided structure requires a value for named_estimators_, and the template shows it as {}, but since no assignment occurred, we leave it as an empty mapping per the structure.
