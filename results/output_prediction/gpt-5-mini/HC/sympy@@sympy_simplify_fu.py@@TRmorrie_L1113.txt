[THOUGHT]
We call TRmorrie with rv = "cos(phi)" (a plain Python string in the input).

TRmorrie returns bottom_up(rv, f). The provided bottom_up implementation does:
- It gets args = getattr(rv, 'args', None).
- For a Python string, there is no 'args' attribute, so args is None.
- Since args is None and nonbasic=False, bottom_up returns rv unchanged.

Therefore TRmorrie returns the original input "cos(phi)" unchanged.
