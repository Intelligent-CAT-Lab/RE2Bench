[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate PrettyPrinter._print_set for s = ["Q.integer", "Q.positive"].

1. _print_set checks if s is empty — it's not.
2. It sorts items = sorted(s, key=default_sort_key). For strings default_sort_key preserves lexicographic order, so "Q.integer" comes before "Q.positive" ('i' < 'p'). Thus items = ["Q.integer", "Q.positive"].
3. It calls pretty = self._print_seq(items). _print_seq will call self._print on each string, produce prettyForm pieces for each, join them with the delimiter ", ", and then wrap with parentheses using parens(left, right). In this call left='{' and right='}', with ifascii_nougly=True.
4. The final prettyForm thus represents the set printed as {Q.integer, Q.positive}.

So the output is the pretty-printed set text "{Q.integer, Q.positive}" (wrapped in a prettyForm object). We represent the resulting printed content as the string "{Q.integer, Q.positive}".

```

    "output": "{Q.integer, Q.positive}"
