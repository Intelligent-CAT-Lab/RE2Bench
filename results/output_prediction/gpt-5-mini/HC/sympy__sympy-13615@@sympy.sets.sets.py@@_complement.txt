[THOUGHT]
We call Set._complement(self, other) with other being a FiniteSet containing the single element 1 (other._elements = frozenset({1})).

1. The code checks isinstance(other, FiniteSet) — true — so it executes that branch.
2. It defines ternary_sift(el) which does: contains = self.contains(el); return contains if contains in [True, False] else None.
3. It calls sift(other, ternary_sift). Iterating over other yields the single element 1. For that element, self.contains(1) does not evaluate to True or False (it produces a symbolic Contains or None), so ternary_sift returns None for element 1.
4. Thus sifted becomes a mapping where key None maps to the list [1] (sifted[None] = [1]); there is no entry for False (sifted[False] is absent/empty).
5. The code returns Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False)).
   - FiniteSet(*sifted[False]) is FiniteSet() -> EmptySet.
   - FiniteSet(*sifted[None]) is FiniteSet(1), which has _elements = frozenset({1}).
   - The overall result simplifies to Complement(FiniteSet(1), self, evaluate=False), but the FiniteSet inside has _elements frozenset({1}).

The structure requested asks for the _elements value, which is frozenset({1}).
