[THOUGHT]
We call _construct_simple(coeffs=None, opt={}). Execution steps:

1. The function starts and sets local flags and float_numbers list.
2. It evaluates "if opt.extension is True:". Here opt is a Python dict ({}), not an object with attributes. Attempting attribute access opt.extension raises an AttributeError before any iteration over coeffs occurs.
3. Therefore the function does not proceed further and raises AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extension'.

No return value is produced; an AttributeError is raised instead.
