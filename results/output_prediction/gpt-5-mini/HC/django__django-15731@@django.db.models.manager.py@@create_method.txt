[THOUGHT]
1. create_method(name, method) defines an inner function manager_method and decorates it with @wraps(method).
2. functools.wraps sets several attributes on the wrapper, including wrapper.__wrapped__ = method.
3. The provided method argument is an empty dict {}.
4. Therefore the returned manager_method will have its __wrapped__ attribute equal to the original method value, i.e. {}.

{
    "__wrapped__": {}
