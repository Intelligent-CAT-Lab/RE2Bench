We run orthogonal_mp_gram with Gram (12x12), Xy shape (12,1), n_nonzero_coefs=1, tol=None.

1. orthogonal_mp_gram converts inputs and prepares coef as a zeros array shape (12,1).
2. It loops over the single column k=0 and calls _gram_omp with Xy[:,0] (1D length 12), n_nonzero_coefs=1.
3. Inside _gram_omp:
   - max_features = n_nonzero_coefs = 1, so only one atom will be selected.
   - It finds lam = argmax(|alpha|) on initial alpha = Xy. The largest absolute entry is at index 1 (value 2.33249979), so lam = 1.
   - Since n_active == 0, L[0,0] = sqrt(Gram[1,1]) = 1.0.
   - Rows and columns 0 and 1 of Gram are swapped, indices array has indices[0] = 1, and Xy entries 0 and 1 are swapped so Xy[0] becomes 2.33249979.
   - potrs solves for gamma: with L = [1.0] and b = Xy[:1] = [2.33249979], gamma = [2.33249979].
   - n_active becomes 1, equals max_features, so the loop ends and _gram_omp returns (gamma, indices[:1], n_active) = ([2.33249979], [1], 1).
4. Back in orthogonal_mp_gram, since return_path is False, it unpacks and sets coef[idx, k] = x, i.e., coef[1,0] = 2.33249979. n_iters = [1], squeezed to 1 (but not returned).
5. The function returns np.squeeze(coef) which gives a 1-D array of length 12 with only the element at index 1 equal to 2.33249979 and all other entries zero.

Therefore the output array is: [0.0, 2.33249979, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
