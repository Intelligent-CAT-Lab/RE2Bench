[THOUGHT]
1. The method begins with: if other is self.physical_unit: return self.to_physical(value).
2. The provided "other" unit has the same identity as self._physical_unit (both represent the same unit and have the same _hash), so the identity check is satisfied (other is self.physical_unit) and the function returns self.to_physical(value).
3. The provided value is the string "2.5". Converting to the physical representation will parse that string to the numeric float 2.5.
4. Therefore the method returns 2.5.
