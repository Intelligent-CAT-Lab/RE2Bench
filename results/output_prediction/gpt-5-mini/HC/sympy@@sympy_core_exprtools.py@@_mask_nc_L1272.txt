[THOUGHT]
1. The function assigns expr = eq. Here eq is the expression 2 - 2*cos(phi).
2. It immediately tests expr.is_commutative. A standard SymPy expression like 2 - 2*cos(phi) is commutative (is_commutative is True).
3. Because expr.is_commutative is True, the function returns early: (eq, {}, []).

So the returned value is the tuple: (the original expression, an empty dict, an empty list). Representing the expression as the same string given in input.
