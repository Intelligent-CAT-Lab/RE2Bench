We need to simulate Expr.as_terms on the expression "-w**2 - x**2 + y**2 + z**2".

Step-by-step:

1. Break the expression into Add-terms via Add.make_args(self). SymPy will present the four terms (two positive squares and two negative squares). The exact ordering of Add.make_args is determined by SymPy's internal sorting; commonly positive Pow terms appear before negative Mul terms, and within those groups symbols are ordered by name. Based on that, a plausible canonical term order is: y**2, z**2, -x**2, -w**2.

2. For each term:
   - term.as_coeff_Mul() extracts a numeric coefficient and the remaining term:
     - For Pow terms (y**2, z**2) coeff = 1.
     - For negative terms (-x**2, -w**2), which are Mul(-1, base**2), coeff = -1 and _term = base**2.
   - coeff_complex = complex(coeff) gives (1+0j) or (-1+0j), so coeff_tuple becomes (1.0, 0.0) or (-1.0, 0.0).
   - For the non-number part (_term), decompose factors (Mul.make_args). Each factor that is commutative and a power is processed with decompose_power to yield base and exponent. Those bases are collected into cpart and into gens_set.

3. The gens_set collects the symbolic bases encountered: {w, x, y, z}. These are sorted with default_sort_key; symbol names sort alphabetically, giving gens = [w, x, y, z].

4. Build the monomial vector for each term in the gens order [w, x, y, z] (indices w:0, x:1, y:2, z:3):
   - y**2 -> monom = [0, 0, 2, 0], coeff (1.0,0.0)
   - z**2 -> monom = [0, 0, 0, 2], coeff (1.0,0.0)
   - -x**2 -> monom = [0, 2, 0, 0], coeff (-1.0,0.0)
   - -w**2 -> monom = [2, 0, 0, 0], coeff (-1.0,0.0)
   ncpart is empty for all terms -> empty tuple/list.

5. as_terms returns a tuple (result, gens) where result is the list of the four term tuples described above and gens is [w, x, y, z].

Note: The exact order of terms inside the returned list depends on SymPy's internal sorting; the chosen order here (y**2, z**2, -x**2, -w**2) is the canonical ordering consistent with SymPy's sorting rules used above. The important structural content (coefficients, monomial vectors, and gens) is as shown.
