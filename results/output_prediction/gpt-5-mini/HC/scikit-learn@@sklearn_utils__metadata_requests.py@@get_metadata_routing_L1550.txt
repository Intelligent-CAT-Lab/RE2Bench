[THOUGHT]
1. The method _get_metadata_request checks if hasattr(self, '_metadata_request').
2. In the input, self has a "_metadata_request" attribute (a string containing a dict), so the condition is True.
3. The code path taken is: requests = get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)
4. The provided problem statement does not include the implementation of get_routing_for_object. With no further transformation described, the most direct simulation is that get_routing_for_object returns the passed object (the stored routing) unchanged.
5. Therefore get_metadata_routing() returns the value of self._metadata_request as given in the input.
