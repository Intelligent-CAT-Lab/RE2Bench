[THOUGHT]
We call restify with cls being an object whose __module__ is "tests.test_util_typing".

Step-by-step through restify:
1. cls is not None and not NoneType.
2. cls is not Ellipsis.
3. The code checks "elif cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:". The provided cls is not one of those specific builtin classes, so this branch is False (no error because the passed-in object is assumed hashable).
4. inspect.isNewType(cls) is False because cls.__module__ != 'typing' and its qualname is not 'NewType.<locals>.new_type'.
5. The types_Union isinstance check is False.
6. cls.__module__ is "tests.test_util_typing", not in ('__builtin__', 'builtins'), so that branch is skipped.
7. sys.version_info >= (3, 7) is True, so the function attempts to return _restify_py37(cls).

However, _restify_py37 is not defined in the provided code snippet, so attempting to call it raises a NameError: name '_restify_py37' is not defined.

Therefore the function does not return normally; it raises a NameError with that message.
