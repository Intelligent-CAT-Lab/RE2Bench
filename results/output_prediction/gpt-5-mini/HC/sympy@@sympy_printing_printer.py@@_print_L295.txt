[THOUGHT]
We call Printer._print(self, expr="phi").

- _print increases self._print_level, then checks if self.printmethod is set and if expr has that attribute. printmethod on the provided self is None, so skip.
- It gets classes = type(expr).__mro__. For expr = "phi" (a Python str), classes = (str, object).
- The method tries to find a method named _print_<ClassName> on the printer for each class in the MRO.
  - For 'str' it would look for _print_str; the provided Printer instance has no such method (only _print and emptyPrinter are defined).
  - For 'object' it would look for _print_object; none exists.
- No specific print method found, so it falls back to self.emptyPrinter(expr).
- Printer.emptyPrinter returns str(expr), which for the string "phi" is "phi".
- _print finally decrements _print_level and returns "phi".

So the output string is "phi".
