[THOUGHT]
We call _getitem_RepMatrix(self, key) with key = [0, 0] (a list).

1. The function first checks if isinstance(key, tuple). key is a list, not a tuple, so it goes to the else branch (the single-index handling).
2. It obtains rows, cols = self.shape. Given self.rows = 3 and self.cols = 3, rows*cols = 9 (non-zero), so it does not return early.
3. Next the code does rep = self._rep.rep. However, in the provided input self._rep is the string "DomainMatrix({0: {0: cos(phi), 1: -sin(phi)}, 1: {0: sin(phi), 1: cos(phi)}, 2: {2: 1}}, (3, 3), EXRAW)". A Python str object has no attribute 'rep', so attempting self._rep.rep raises an AttributeError at this point. This exception occurs before any further processing (e.g., the index_ call).
4. Therefore the function does not return a normal value; it raises AttributeError: "'str' object has no attribute 'rep'".

So the outcome is an AttributeError being raised with that message.
