[THOUGHT]
We call MatrixExpr.__getitem__(self, key) with key = [1, 2] (a Python list).

1. First check: if not isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(key, slice):
   - key is a list, so isinstance(key, slice) is False → this branch is skipped.

2. Next check: if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 2:
   - key is a list, not a tuple → False → skip.

3. Next check: elif isinstance(key, (SYMPY_INTS, Integer)):
   - key is a list → False → skip.

4. Next check: elif isinstance(key, (Symbol, Expr)):
   - key is a list → False → skip.

5. None of the branches matched, so the final statement executes:
   raise IndexError('Invalid index, wanted %s[i,j]' % self)

The error message uses %s with self. Given the provided "self" state (an empty object in the input), stringifying it yields "{}", so the resulting message is:
"Invalid index, wanted {}[i,j]"

Thus the call raises an IndexError with that message.
