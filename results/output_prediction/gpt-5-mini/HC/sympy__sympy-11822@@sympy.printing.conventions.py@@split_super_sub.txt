[THOUGHT]
We run split_super_sub("Fvec").

- text is not empty.
- Initialize pos = 0, name = None, supers = [], subs = [].
- Loop (pos < len(text) i.e. 0 < 4):
  - start = pos + 1 = 1.
  - text[0:2] is "Fv", not "__", so start stays 1.
  - find '^' from index 1 -> not found -> pos_hat = 4.
  - find '_' from index 1 -> not found -> pos_usc = 4.
  - pos_next = min(4,4) = 4.
  - part = text[0:4] = "Fvec".
  - set pos = 4.
  - name is None, so name = "Fvec".
- Loop ends (pos == len(text)).
- Try to match name with regex '^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$' — "Fvec" has no trailing digits so there's no match.
- Therefore return (name, supers, subs) -> ("Fvec", [], []).

So the function returns the tuple ("Fvec", [], []).
