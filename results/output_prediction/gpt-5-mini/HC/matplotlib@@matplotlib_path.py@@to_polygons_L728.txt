[THOUGHT]
1. to_polygons checks len(self.vertices) != 0: here vertices has length 2, so not empty.
2. transform is None.
3. codes is None and (width == 0 or height == 0) is True (both width and height are 0), so it takes the fast path.
4. vertices is set to self.vertices => [[80., 330.], [576., 330.]].
5. closed_only is False, so it does not require >=3 vertices or append the first vertex.
6. transform is None, so it returns [vertices], i.e. a list containing the vertex list.
