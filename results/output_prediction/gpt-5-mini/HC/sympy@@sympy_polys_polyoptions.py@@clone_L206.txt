[THOUGHT]
1. The clone method:
   - Creates obj = dict.__new__(self.__class__) — a new empty dict-like instance of the same class.
   - Copies all (option, value) pairs from self.items() into obj. Here self is empty ({}), so nothing is copied.
   - Copies all (option, value) pairs from updates into obj. updates contains {"gens": ["cos(phi)"]}, so obj['gens'] will be set to ["cos(phi)"].
   - Returns obj.

2. The returned object therefore has no "fraction" key (so that should be null/None in JSON) and has a "gens" key with the value ["cos(phi)"].

3. Note: although Options.gens is declared as a tuple type, clone does not convert the list to a tuple — it places the provided value as-is.

So the output JSON fields are:
- "fraction": null
- "gens": ["cos(phi)"]

```
{
    "fraction": null,
    "gens": [
        "cos(phi)"
    ]
}
```
