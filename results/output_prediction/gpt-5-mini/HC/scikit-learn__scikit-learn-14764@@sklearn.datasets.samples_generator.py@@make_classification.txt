[THOUGHT]
I need to predict the exact return value of make_classification with the given keyword arguments, including all numeric array contents. The function uses numpy random state and several helper utilities (_generate_hypercube, sample_without_replacement, etc.). The produced arrays (X, y) are determined by draws from the RandomState object and by internal implementations of sample_without_replacement and other helper functions; the precise numeric outputs depend on the exact sequence of random numbers consumed by those helpers (e.g., whether sample_without_replacement uses randint or permutation, how many RNG draws it consumes), and on low-level details of numpy's RandomState state progression.

Because the code calls into multiple RNG-using helpers before and during the data generation (sample_without_replacement inside _generate_hypercube, then generator.rand twice, then generator.randn to produce X, then generator.rand again to build A, etc.), the exact floats returned depend on the exact call sequence and RNG state transitions. Without executing the code with the exact same library implementations (numpy / sklearn versions) I cannot deterministically and reliably produce the full numeric arrays element-by-element.

However, I can describe the structure of the output exactly:
- The function returns a tuple (X, y).
- X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (50, 2) of dtype float64.
- y is a numpy.ndarray of shape (50,) of integer labels; since n_classes=1 and flip_y=0, y will be all zeros.

Because the problem asks for the exact numeric output arrays but their precise values depend on the detailed RNG-consumption behavior of helper functions (which is not fully specified here), I cannot produce a guaranteed-accurate elementwise numeric listing.

Therefore I return a representation indicating the exact shapes and the label vector (all zeros), but I cannot supply the exact 50x2 numeric matrix without running the code in the exact environment.
