[THOUGHT]
intersects_path simply calls _path.path_intersects_path(self, other, filled).

Self has vertices [(0.,0.), (2.,0.)]. Other has vertices [(0.,0.), (1.99969539, -0.03490481)] — both are two-vertex paths that share the exact point (0,0). Because they share that vertex, the paths intersect. Therefore the call returns True.
