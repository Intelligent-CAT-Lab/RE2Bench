[THOUGHT]
We call build_class(self).

1. The first statement in build_class is self._eval_snippets(). That will invoke the method _eval_snippets on the _ClassBuilder instance.
2. Inside _eval_snippets, the code tries to build "script = '\n'.join([snippet[0] for snippet in self._script_snippets])". This requires reading the attribute self._script_snippets.
3. The provided self only includes the keys "auto_attribs", "these", and "has_custom_setattr". There is no attribute _script_snippets on the instance.
4. Attempting to access self._script_snippets therefore raises an AttributeError: "_ClassBuilder' object has no attribute '_script_snippets'".
5. The call to build_class does not complete; it raises that AttributeError.

So the function does not return a normal value; it raises AttributeError with that message.
