[THOUGHT]
1. The SDM.extract method begins by checking "if not (self and rows and cols)". Here "self" is an SDM instance represented with no stored nonzero elements (the input provides only shape and domain, no dict entries), so self is falsy as a dict. rows = [0,1,2] and cols = [0] are non-empty.
2. Because self is falsy, the method returns self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain).
3. zeros((3,1), domain) constructs and returns a new SDM with an empty internal dict and shape (3,1) — representing a 3x1 all-zero sparse matrix.
4. In the requested output structure we need the explicit values for each requested row/col position. All entries in the returned zeros SDM are zero in the given domain ("ZZ"), so each (row, col) value is 0.
