[THOUGHT]
1. call_command is called with command_name = "transaction" (a string), so the function goes into the else branch and tries to resolve the command via get_commands()[command_name].
2. get_commands() returns a mapping of available command names to their app names. If "transaction" is not present in that mapping, attempting to access get_commands()[command_name] raises a KeyError.
3. call_command catches that KeyError and raises a CommandError with the message "Unknown command: %r" % command_name. For command_name "transaction", the message becomes "Unknown command: 'transaction'".
4. Therefore call_command does not return normally but raises django.core.management.base.CommandError with that message. Representing that as the output string yields "CommandError: Unknown command: 'transaction'".
