[THOUGHT]
- The function _osborne(e, d) defines an inner function f(rv) that only transforms objects that are instances of HyperbolicFunction; otherwise f returns rv unchanged.
- The provided input value for e is the Python string: -"sinh(x)" + "cosh(x)"*tanh(x). This is a plain string, not a SymPy expression or HyperbolicFunction.
- bottom_up(e, f) will therefore not find any HyperbolicFunction instances inside the string and will return the input unchanged.
- The function returns the same string value that was passed in as e.

```
{
    "output": "-\"sinh(x)\" + \"cosh(x)\"*tanh(x)"
