[THOUGHT]
We call check_in with room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1".

1. The method checks if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys(). self.booked_rooms has key "single", so this condition is False and we do not return False.
2. Next it checks if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]. self.booked_rooms["single"] is an empty dict {}, so "guest 1" is not in it. That if-block is skipped entirely.
3. There are no further statements and no explicit return at the end of the method, so the function returns None implicitly.

Therefore the output is null in JSON.
