[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single character from input, takes its ordinal value, adds 1, converts back to a character, and prints it.

Given the provided input "\"a\"", that represents the single character a as the input character. ord('a') = 97, +1 = 98, chr(98) = 'b'. The program will print:
b

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "b"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
