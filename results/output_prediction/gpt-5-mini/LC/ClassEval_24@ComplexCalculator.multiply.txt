[THOUGHT]
We call ComplexCalculator.multiply with c1 = "(-1-2j)" and c2 = "(-3-4j)" (both are Python strings according to the provided input).

Inside multiply:
- The code attempts to access c1.real. But c1 is a str, and str objects do not have a .real attribute.
- Therefore attribute access fails immediately and Python raises an AttributeError: "'str' object has no attribute 'real'".

No further computation occurs because of this exception.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real'"
}
```
