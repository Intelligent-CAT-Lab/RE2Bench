[THOUGHT]
1. self.inventory has a key "1" (string) with quantity 90.
2. create_order is called with product_id = 1 (int).
3. get_product_quantity checks "if product_id in self.inventory": int 1 is not equal to string "1", so the key is not found and get_product_quantity returns False.
4. Back in create_order, it evaluates "if self.get_product_quantity(product_id) >= quantity": that becomes "if False >= 10". In Python, False is equivalent to 0, so 0 >= 10 is False.
5. The else branch executes and create_order returns False.

Therefore the function returns False.
