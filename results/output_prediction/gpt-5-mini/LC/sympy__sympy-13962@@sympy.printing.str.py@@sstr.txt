[THOUGHT]
We call sstr(expr, order=None).

1. sstr constructs a StrPrinter with the given settings and calls p.doprint(expr).
2. StrPrinter.doprint returns str(self._print(expr)).
3. Printer._print inspects the runtime class of expr and dispatches to StrPrinter._print_Permutation (there is a _print_Permutation implementation).
4. In _print_Permutation, the code has two branches depending on Permutation.print_cyclic. The sensible/default behavior for printing an identity permutation of size >= 5 is to produce the compact form "Permutation([], size=6)" (the code in the non-cyclic branch does exactly that when expr.support() is empty and expr.size >= 5).
5. For the given expr (size 6 and no nontrivial mappings -> support is empty), the printer returns "Permutation([], size=6)".

So the final returned string from sstr is "Permutation([], size=6)".

    "output": "Permutation([], size=6)"
