[THOUGHT]
We call filter_by_substring(strings, substring) which returns [x for x in strings if substring in x].

Check each string for substring "run":
- "grunt": contains "run" (positions 1-3) -> include.
- "trumpet": does not contain "run" -> exclude.
- "prune": contains "run" (positions 1-3) -> include.
- "gruesome": does not contain "run" -> exclude.

Resulting list: ["grunt", "prune"].
