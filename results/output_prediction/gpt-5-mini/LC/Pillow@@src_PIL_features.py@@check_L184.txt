[THOUGHT]
1. The top-level check(feature) first tests membership in modules, codecs, then features.
2. "freetype2" is a known Pillow feature (it's in the features mapping), so check() will call check_feature("freetype2").
3. check_feature looks up features["freetype2"] -> (module, flag, ver). For freetype2 the module is the C extension module e.g. "PIL._imagingft" and the flag is "freetype2".
4. It then tries to import that module. If the freetype support extension module is not present, __import__ raises ModuleNotFoundError and check_feature returns None.
5. In typical environments without the compiled freetype extension available, the import fails and check_feature returns None. Therefore check("freetype2") returns None.
