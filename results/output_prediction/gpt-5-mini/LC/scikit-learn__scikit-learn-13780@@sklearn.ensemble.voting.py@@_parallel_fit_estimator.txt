We call _parallel_fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, sample_weight=None). Since sample_weight is None, it simply calls estimator.fit(X, y). The estimator is a GaussianNB-like object; GaussianNB.fit invokes check_X_y and then _partial_fit with _refit=True.

Inside _partial_fit:
- It computes epsilon_ = var_smoothing * max(np.var(X, axis=0)). With var_smoothing = 1e-9, epsilon_ is a very small number (on the order of 1e-9).
- It initializes or resets class-related attributes and computes per-class statistics from the provided X and y.
- For this input (the standard iris split with 3 classes of 50 samples each and the two selected features), the resulting learned parameters are the typical GaussianNB estimates for the iris data restricted to these two features:
  - classes_ = array([0, 1, 2])
  - class_count_ = array([50., 50., 50.])
  - class_prior_ = array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
  - theta_ contains the per-class feature means:
      [[3.418, 1.464],
       [2.770, 4.260],
       [2.974, 5.552]]
    (values rounded to 3 decimal places as commonly reported)
  - sigma_ contains the per-class feature variances (within-class), and GaussianNB adds epsilon_ to each variance element; typical (pre-epsilon) values are approximately:
      [[0.14871111, 0.03010612],
       [0.09846939, 0.21640082],
       [0.10400408, 0.29849598]]
- priors remains None and var_smoothing remains 1e-9.

Therefore the fitted estimator will contain these attributes (epsilon_ is var_smoothing times the maximum column variance, a tiny ~1e-9 value). Below is the expected JSON output with these typical sklearn GaussianNB results for this iris-based input.
