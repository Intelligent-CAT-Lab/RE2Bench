[THOUGHT]
1. The method tries to _sympify(other). The input other "1" becomes an Integer(1) successfully (no SympifyError).
2. other.is_Integer is True, so the branch is taken.
3. It computes self.p < other.p. Interpreting self "3" as Integer(3), this compares 3 < 1 which is False.
4. It then returns _sympify(False). sympify(False, strict=True) produces the Python boolean False (SymPy/strict sympify of a boolean yields the boolean).
5. Therefore the method returns False.
