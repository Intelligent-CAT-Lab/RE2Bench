[THOUGHT]
1. dup_l1_norm checks "if not f": f is [1, 2], so it's non-empty — go to else branch.
2. It calls dup_abs(f, K). dup_abs returns [K.abs(coeff) for coeff in f]. For coefficients 1 and 2 their absolute values are 1 and 2, so dup_abs(...) -> [1, 2].
3. It then returns K.sum(...) of that list. Summing [1, 2] gives 3.
4. Final returned value is 3.
