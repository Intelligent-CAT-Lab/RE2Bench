[THOUGHT]
- __pow__ is called with n = -2 (an int), so the isinstance(n, Permutation) check is false.
- n = int(n) keeps n = -2.
- __pow__ returns self._af_new(_af_pow(self.array_form, n)).
- self._array_form is None, self._cyclic_form is None, but self._size is 7. In sympy's Permutation, when _array_form is None and _size is set, array_form is the identity array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].
- _af_pow applied to the identity array with any integer exponent (including negative) returns the identity array.
- self._af_new constructs a new permutation from that array; its _array_form will be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] and _size remains 7.

Therefore the result permutation has array form [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] and size 7.
