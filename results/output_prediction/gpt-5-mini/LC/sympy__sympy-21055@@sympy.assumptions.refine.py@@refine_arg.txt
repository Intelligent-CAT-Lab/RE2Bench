[THOUGHT]
1. The function does: rg = expr.args[0].
   - Given the provided expr representation, the first argument is the element '1' (from the nargs/_args_set), so rg is effectively '1'.
2. It then calls ask(Q.positive(rg), assumptions). With assumptions given as the string "Q.positive(x)" and rg = '1', this ask call does not evaluate to True (the assumptions don't assert Q.positive on this rg).
3. Next it calls ask(Q.negative(rg), assumptions) — this also does not evaluate to True.
4. Since neither condition holds, the function reaches the final return and returns None.
