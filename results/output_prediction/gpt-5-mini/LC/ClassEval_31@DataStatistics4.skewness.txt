[THOUGHT]
We call skewness with data = [1, 1, 1].

Step-by-step:
- n = len(data) = 3
- mean = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0
- variance = sum((x - mean)^2 for each x) / n = 0 / 3 = 0.0
- std_deviation = sqrt(variance) = 0.0
- Since std_deviation == 0, the function returns 0 (the conditional returns 0 in that case).

Therefore the output is 0.
