[THOUGHT]
- The method generate_email_pattern constructs a single local variable:
  pattern = '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'
- This is a Python string literal where each backslash is escaped (so the actual string contains the characters '\' and 'b' where written as \\b in the source).
- The method then returns that string unchanged.
- Therefore the output is the exact pattern string: \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b
- In JSON representation, backslashes must be escaped, so each single backslash becomes two backslashes.
