[THOUGHT]
1. The input array is an empty list [].
2. map(lambda num: 'n' * num, array) over an empty list produces an empty iterator, so just_ns becomes [].
3. final_output is initialized as an empty list. The for loop over just_ns does nothing because it's empty.
4. The function returns final_output, which is [].

    "output": []
