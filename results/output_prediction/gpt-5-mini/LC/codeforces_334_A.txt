[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads the input line "8" and converts it to integer n = 8.
2. It sets i = 1 and j = n * n = 64.
3. The while loop runs while i < j. On each iteration it prints "i j", then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
4. Iterations produce pairs:
   (1,64), (2,63), (3,62), ..., up to (32,33). After printing (32,33) i becomes 33 and j becomes 32, so i < j is false and the loop stops.
5. Each pair is printed on its own line with a single space between numbers.

So the output lines are "1 64" through "32 33", each on a new line.
