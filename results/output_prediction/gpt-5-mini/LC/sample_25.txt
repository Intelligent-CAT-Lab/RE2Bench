[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives d = {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}.
2. It makes a shallow copy with d = d.copy(), so the copy has the same insertion order: "l", "t", "x:".
3. d.popitem() removes and returns the last inserted (key, value) pair. That is ("x:", 3), so that pair is removed.
4. The function returns the modified dict, which is {"l": 1, "t": 2}.
