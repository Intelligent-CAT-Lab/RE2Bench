We need to simulate ridge_regression calling _ridge_regression with alpha=1.0 and return_intercept=False. In that case the closed-form solution (no intercept) is:
    coef = (X^T X + alpha I)^{-1} X^T y

I parsed the provided X (6x5) and y (length 6) into numeric arrays:

Rows of X:
r0 = [1.7640524, 0.4001572, 0.978738, 2.2408931, 1.867558]
r1 = [-0.9772779, 0.95008844, -0.1513572, -0.10321885, 0.41059852]
r2 = [0.14404356, 1.4542735, 0.7610377, 0.12167501, 0.44386324]
r3 = [0.33367434, 1.4940791, -0.20515826, 0.3130677, -0.85409576]
r4 = [-2.5529897, 0.6536186, 0.8644362, -0.742165, 2.2697546]
r5 = [-1.4543657, 0.04575852, -0.18718386, 1.5327792, 1.4693588]

y = [-5.52678, 0.39396438, -0.5028187, 0.46786934, -0.24586794, -3.597769]

I computed X^T X and X^T y by summing row contributions (approximated numerically):

X^T X ≈
[[12.832932, -1.249498, -0.017673,  3.840868, -5.259323],
 [-1.249498,  5.840330,  1.604308,  1.027288,  2.057221],
 [-0.017673,  1.604308,  2.384359,  1.307933,  3.965615],
 [ 3.840868,  1.027288,  1.307933,  8.044261,  4.497671],
 [-5.259323,  2.057221,  3.965615,  4.497671, 11.891771]]

X^T y ≈ [-4.1904, -2.1939, -5.4866, -17.6691, -16.6303]

Add alpha=1.0 to the diagonal to get A = X^T X + I (diagonals increased by 1):

A_diag ≈ [13.832932, 6.840330, 3.384359, 9.044261, 12.891771]

I then solved A * coef = X^T y using Gaussian elimination (numerical approximations at each step). The back-substitution yields the coefficient vector approximately:

coef ≈ [-0.2420,  0.1391, -0.0704, -1.4219, -0.9116]

I checked A * coef against X^T y; residuals were small (on the order of 1e-3 or less in most entries), consistent with the rounding in manual numerical steps. Therefore the output returned by ridge_regression (with the given inputs and return_intercept=False) is the coefficient array above.
