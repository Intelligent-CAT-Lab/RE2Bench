[THOUGHT]
We simulate delete_from_database:

- The method receives self.database_name = "test.db", table_name = "test_table", name = "Alice".
- It calls sqlite3.connect("test.db") to open (or create) the SQLite database file "test.db".
- It gets a cursor from the connection.
- It builds the SQL string: 'DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?'.
- It executes cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,)) with name = "Alice", which runs a parameterized DELETE removing rows where name == "Alice".
- It calls conn.commit() to persist the change.
- It calls conn.close() to close the connection.
- The method has no return statement, so it returns None (Python None, represented as null in JSON).

There are no exceptions handled here; assuming the database and table exist (or the execution runs), the function completes and returns None.
