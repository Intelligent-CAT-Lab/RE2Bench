[THOUGHT]
We run greatest_common_divisor(10, 15).

Initial: a = 10, b = 15.
Loop iteration 1: b is 15 (truthy). Set (a, b) = (15, 10 % 15) -> (15, 10).
Iteration 2: b is 10. Set (a, b) = (10, 15 % 10) -> (10, 5).
Iteration 3: b is 5. Set (a, b) = (5, 10 % 5) -> (5, 0).
Now b is 0, loop ends. Return a, which is 5.
