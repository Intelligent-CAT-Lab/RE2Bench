[THOUGHT]
1. verify() calls self._load_library() first.
2. _load_library() uses self.library. The class defines library = 'argon2' (self dict doesn't override it), so it will attempt importlib.import_module('argon2').
3. In this execution environment the 'argon2' module is not available, so importlib.import_module('argon2') raises ImportError("No module named 'argon2'").
4. _load_library() catches ImportError as e and raises a ValueError with the message:
   "Couldn't load 'Argon2PasswordHasher' algorithm library: No module named 'argon2'".
5. That ValueError propagates out of verify() (verify() does not catch ValueError), so the call to verify() results in that ValueError being raised.

Therefore the output is the ValueError with that message.
