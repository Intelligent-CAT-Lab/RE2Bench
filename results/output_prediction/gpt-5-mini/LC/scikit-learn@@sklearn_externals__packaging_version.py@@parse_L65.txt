1. parse("1.11.3") will attempt to construct a Version object with the string "1.11.3".
2. The Version __init__ uses a regex to validate and parse the version. "1.11.3" matches PEP 440 style (no epoch, release "1.11.3", no pre/post/dev/local).
3. The Version instance is created successfully with internal _version fields:
   - epoch = 0
   - release = (1, 11, 3)
   - pre = None
   - post = None
   - dev = None
   - local = None
   and a computed _key for comparisons.
4. parse returns that Version instance. The typical repr for a packaging.version.Version instance is "<Version('1.11.3')>" (str() would be "1.11.3").

Therefore the function returns the Version instance representing "1.11.3".
