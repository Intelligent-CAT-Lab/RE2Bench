[THOUGHT]
We call ComplexCalculator.subtract with c1 = "(-1+2j)" (a Python str) and c2 = "(-3+4j)" (also a str).
Inside subtract, the code does:
    real = c1.real - c2.real
Accessing c1.real attempts to get the 'real' attribute on a str object. Python str objects do not have a 'real' attribute, so this raises an AttributeError before any arithmetic is performed.
The exception message is: "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'real'".
Therefore the function does not return a value but raises that AttributeError.
