[THOUGHT]
We call level_up on a character with level=3, hp=140, attack_power=30, defense=20, exp=0.

Method logic:
- Since level < 100, increment level by 1: 3 -> 4
- Reset exp to 0 (already 0)
- hp increases by 20: 140 -> 160
- attack_power increases by 5: 30 -> 35
- defense increases by 5: 20 -> 25

The method returns a tuple (level, hp, attack_power, defense) which becomes (4, 160, 35, 25).
