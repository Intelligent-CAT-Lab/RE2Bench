[THOUGHT]
The program reads one line into stdin. The provided input value "\"BBA\"" represents the characters: "BBA" (including the double-quote characters).

So:
- stdin = '"BBA"' (5 characters: quote, B, B, A, quote)
- s = stdin -> '"BBA"'
- Check `'A' in s` -> True (there is an 'A')
- Check `'B' in s` -> True (there are 'B's)
- Both conditions true, so result = 'Yes'
- Printed output is: Yes
