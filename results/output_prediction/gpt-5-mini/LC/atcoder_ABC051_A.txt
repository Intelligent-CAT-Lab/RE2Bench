[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single line from input, then replaces every comma with a space and prints the result.

The provided input value (the "input" field) is the string:
"\"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc\""
That means the actual characters fed to input() are the double-quote, then avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc, then double-quote.

Replacing commas with spaces transforms:
"avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc"
into:
"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"
(with the surrounding double-quote characters preserved).

Thus the printed output is:
"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"
[/THOUGHT]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "\"avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc\""
}
```
