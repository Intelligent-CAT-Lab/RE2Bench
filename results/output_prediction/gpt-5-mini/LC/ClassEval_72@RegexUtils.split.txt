[THOUGHT]
The regex \b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b matches the three phone numbers in the text: "123-456-7890", "876-286-9876", and "987-762-9767". re.split returns the substrings between these matches. 

- Before the first match there is nothing -> "".
- Between the first and second match is " abiguygusu " (note the surrounding spaces).
- Between the second and third match is " kjgufwycs " (with spaces).
- After the third match there is nothing -> "".

So the resulting list is ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""].

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["", " abiguygusu ", " kjgufwycs ", ""]
}
