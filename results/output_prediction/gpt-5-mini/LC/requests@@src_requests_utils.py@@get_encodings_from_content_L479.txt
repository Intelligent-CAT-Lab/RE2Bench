[THOUGHT]
1. The function compiles three regexes and returns the concatenation of their findall results.
2. charset_re looks for '<meta' ... 'charset=...' and captures the value up to the next quote/greater-than. In the input content the substring 'charset=UTF-8"' is present, so charset_re.findall(...) yields ['UTF-8'].
3. pragma_re looks for 'content=...;?charset=...' where 'charset=' must immediately follow an optional semicolon after the content= quote. In the input the content attribute contains 'text/html;charset=...', so there is extra 'text/html' between the opening quote and the semicolon; therefore pragma_re does not match.
4. xml_re is for an XML declaration at the start of the string and does not match.
5. Concatenating results gives ['UTF-8'].
