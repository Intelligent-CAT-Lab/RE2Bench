We simulate DiscountStrategy.due with the provided self.

1. The instance has a stored private total at _DiscountStrategy__total: 150.0. This is what due uses as self.__total.
2. due() checks if promotion is None. Here promotion is not None; it's a wrapper function that selects the best available promotion.
3. Call discount = self.promotion(self). The wrapper will compute available promotions on this cart:
   - Total = 150.0.
   - fidelity promotion (customer.fidelity = 1200 >= 1000) gives 5% → 0.05 * 150.0 = 7.5.
   - bulk-item promotion does not apply (all quantities are 1).
   - large-order promotion applies because there are 15 distinct items (>=10), giving 7% → 0.07 * 150.0 = 10.5.
   - The wrapper picks the best discount = max(7.5, 0, 10.5) = 10.5.
4. due returns self.__total - discount = 150.0 - 10.5 = 139.5.

So the method returns the numeric value 139.5.
