[THOUGHT]
1. The function checks "if not is_32bit". Here is_32bit is True, so that condition is False and we continue.
2. Since is_32bit is True, it checks if arch.startswith('ppc'). The arch is "x86_64", which does not start with "ppc".
3. Because the arch does not start with "ppc" and we are in 32-bit mode, the function returns "i386".
