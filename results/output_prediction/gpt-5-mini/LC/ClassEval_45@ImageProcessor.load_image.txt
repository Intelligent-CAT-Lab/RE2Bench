[THOUGHT]
The method ImageProcessor.load_image sets self.image = Image.open(image_path) and does not have an explicit return statement. In Python, a function without a return returns None. Therefore, regardless of whether Image.open succeeds, the return value of load_image will be None (represented as null in JSON). Note: self.image would be set to a PIL.Image.Image object if the file exists and opens successfully, but the function's output is still None.
