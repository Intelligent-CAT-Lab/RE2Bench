[THOUGHT]
We call derivative with xs = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4].

1. enumerate(xs) produces pairs: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,4).
2. The list comprehension [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)] computes:
   - 0 * 3 = 0
   - 1 * 2 = 2
   - 2 * 1 = 2
   - 3 * 0 = 0
   - 4 * 4 = 16
   So the intermediate list is [0, 2, 2, 0, 16].
3. The function returns that list sliced with [1:], removing the first element: [2, 2, 0, 16].

Therefore the output is [2, 2, 0, 16].
