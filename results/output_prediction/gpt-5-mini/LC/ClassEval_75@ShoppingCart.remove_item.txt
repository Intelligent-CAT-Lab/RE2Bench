[THOUGHT]
We have a ShoppingCart instance whose items dict contains "apple" with quantity 4.
remove_item("apple") is called with the default quantity=1.
- The method checks if "apple" is in self.items: True.
- It subtracts quantity (1) from self.items["apple"]["quantity"]: 4 - 1 = 3.
- There is no return statement, so the method returns None.

Therefore the output is None (JSON null).

    "output": null
