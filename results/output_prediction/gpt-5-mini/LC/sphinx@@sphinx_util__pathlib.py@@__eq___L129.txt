[THOUGHT]
1. The __eq__ implementation checks types of other.
2. other is the string "_StrPath('/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html')", so isinstance(other, PurePath) is False and isinstance(other, str) is True.
3. Therefore the method will call warnings.warn(...) and then return self.__str__() == other.
4. self.__str__() for a Path yields a path like "/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html" (no class wrapper). The provided other string includes the class name and quotes ("_StrPath('/tmp/...')"), so the two strings are not equal.
5. The method therefore returns False.
