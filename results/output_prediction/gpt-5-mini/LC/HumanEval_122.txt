[THOUGHT]
Let's run the function step by step.

1. The function takes arr and k=4. It slices arr[:k] which gives the first 4 elements: [111, 21, 3, 4000].
2. It iterates over that list and includes an element only if len(str(elem)) <= 2:
   - 111 -> str('111') has length 3 -> excluded
   - 21  -> str('21') has length 2 -> included
   - 3   -> str('3') has length 1 -> included
   - 4000-> str('4000') has length 4 -> excluded
3. The included elements are 21 and 3. Their sum is 21 + 3 = 24.

So the function returns 24.
