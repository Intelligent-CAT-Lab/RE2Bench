[THOUGHT]
We call pts_to_midstep(x, *args) with:
- x = [0.,1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.] (length 10)
- args is a single argument which is the list [1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.,10.]

Step-by-step:
1. steps = np.zeros((1 + len(args), 2 * len(x))) -> len(args)=1 so shape = (2, 20), all zeros.
2. x becomes a numpy array of length 10.
3. Compute midpoints (x[:-1] + x[1:]) / 2 -> [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5] (length 9).
4. Assign these midpoints to steps[0, 1:-1:2] and to steps[0, 2::2]:
   - indices 1,3,5,...,17 receive midpoints[0..8]
   - indices 2,4,6,...,18 also receive the same midpoints[0..8]
5. steps[0, :1] = x[:1] sets steps[0,0] = 0.0
6. steps[0, -1:] = x[-1:] sets steps[0,19] = 9.0
   After these, row 0 becomes:
   [0.0,0.5,0.5,1.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5.5,5.5,6.5,6.5,7.5,7.5,8.5,8.5,9.0]
7. steps[1:, 0::2] = args sets row 1 even columns (0,2,4,...,18) to [1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.,10.].
8. steps[1:, 1::2] = steps[1:, 0::2] copies those values to odd columns (1,3,5,...,19).
   After this, row 1 becomes:
   [1.,1.,2.,2.,3.,3.,4.,4.,5.,5.,6.,6.,7.,7.,8.,8.,9.,9.,10.,10.]

Return the 2x20 array with those rows.
