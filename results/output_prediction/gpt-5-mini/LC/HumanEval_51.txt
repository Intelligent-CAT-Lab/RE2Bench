[THOUGHT]
We run remove_vowels on "abcdef\nghijklm".

Iterate characters:
- 'a' -> vowel -> removed
- 'b' -> kept
- 'c' -> kept
- 'd' -> kept
- 'e' -> vowel -> removed
- 'f' -> kept
- '\n' -> not a vowel -> kept (newline preserved)
- 'g' -> kept
- 'h' -> kept
- 'i' -> vowel -> removed
- 'j' -> kept
- 'k' -> kept
- 'l' -> kept
- 'm' -> kept

Joining kept characters yields: "bcdf\nghjklm"
