[THOUGHT]
We call add_item with item_name="Coke", price=1.25, quantity=10 on a VendingMachine whose inventory already contains "Coke" with quantity 20.

1. add_item calls self.restock_item("Coke", 10).
2. restock_item sees "Coke" in self.inventory, so it increases its 'quantity' by 10: 20 -> 30, and returns True.
3. Back in add_item, the if not self.restock_item(...) check is False (since restock_item returned True), so the body (which would create a new inventory entry) is not executed.
4. add_item has no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null). The inventory is mutated in place to have "Coke" quantity 30.

Therefore the function output is None (null in JSON).
