[THOUGHT]
- The method is called with self.table_name = "table1", fields not provided (so fields is None), and condition = "age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".
- Since fields is None, the code sets fields = '*'.
- It builds sql = f'SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}' -> "SELECT * FROM table1".
- condition is not None, so it appends " WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20".
- It returns the string with a trailing semicolon.
- Final returned SQL: "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
