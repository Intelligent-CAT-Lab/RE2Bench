[THOUGHT]
1. The input string provided is "\"20 30\"", which represents the console input: 20 30.
2. input().split() yields the two tokens "20" and "30".
3. map(int, ...) converts them to integers: A = 20, B = 30.
4. ans = A - 2 * B = 20 - 60 = -40.
5. Since ans < 0, ans is set to 0.
6. The program prints 0.
