[THOUGHT]
We call write_xml(self, file_name="") with self.root = None.

1. The method tries to create an ElementTree from self.root: ET.ElementTree(self.root). Passing None as the root does not raise immediately; an ElementTree object is constructed with a None root.
2. Next it calls tree.write(file_name). Here file_name is the empty string "". ElementTree.write treats a string filename as a path and will attempt to open that path for writing. Attempting to open a file with an empty-string path raises an OSError/FileNotFoundError on typical systems.
3. That exception is caught by the broad except: clause, so the method returns False.

Therefore the output is the boolean False.
