[THOUGHT]
Let's run the function step by step with arr = [-4, 4] and k = 2.

1. Check if k == 0: it's not (k is 2), so continue.
2. Call arr.sort(): the list becomes [-4, 4] (already sorted).
3. Compute ans = arr[-k:], which is arr[-2:]. For a list of length 2, arr[-2:] returns the whole list: [-4, 4].
4. Return ans, which is [-4, 4].
