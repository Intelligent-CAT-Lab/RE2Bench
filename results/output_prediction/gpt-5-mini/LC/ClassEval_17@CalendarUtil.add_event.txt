[THOUGHT]
The method add_event simply appends the provided event to self.events and returns None (no explicit return).

Step-by-step:
1. self.events initially contains one event (the New Year event).
2. add_event is called with the same event dict.
3. The method executes self.events.append(event), so self.events now contains two entries (the original and the appended one).
4. The method returns None implicitly.

Therefore the output (return value) is None, which in JSON is null.
