[THOUGHT]
We execute Permutation.__invert__(self) which does: return self._af_new(_af_invert(self._array_form))

- The method first evaluates self._array_form. From input it is null (i.e. None).
- It then calls _af_invert(self._array_form) -> _af_invert(None). No implementation of _af_invert is provided here. Given only the provided state, the only safe conclusion is that the inversion is asked for an uninitialized array form (None), so nothing useful can be produced; the result of attempting to invert None is therefore None (no array form to invert).
- Next _af_new is called with that result: _af_new(None). With no array form provided, the new Permutation will have no concrete _array_form set (None). The _size in the input was 5 and nothing in these calls changes the given size value in the absence of a concrete array form, so _size remains 5.

Thus the resulting permutation object has _array_form = null and _size = 5.
