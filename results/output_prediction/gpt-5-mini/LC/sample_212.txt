[THOUGHT]
We execute f(nums) with nums = [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3].
1. len(nums) is 7, so the loop runs range(6) → 6 iterations.
2. Each iteration calls nums.reverse(), which reverses the list in place.
3. Reversing toggles between the original order and the reversed order. After an even number of reverses (6), the list returns to its original order.
4. Therefore the function returns the original list: [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3].
