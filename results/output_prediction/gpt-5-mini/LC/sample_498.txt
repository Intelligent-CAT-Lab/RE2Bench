[THOUGHT]
We execute f(nums, idx, added):

- nums is [2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3], idx = 2, added = 3.
- The statement nums[idx:idx] = (added,) performs a slice assignment inserting the tuple (3,) at position 2 without removing any elements.
- Elements before index 2 ([2, 2]) remain, then 3 is inserted, then the remaining elements from the original list starting at index 2 ([3, 2, 3, 3]) follow.
- Resulting list: [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3].
- The function returns this mutated list.
