[THOUGHT]
The method uses re.sub(re.compile('\\n+'), '\n', text) to replace any run of one or more newline characters with a single '\n'. The input text "Some sentence here." contains no newline characters, so the substitution does nothing and the original string is returned unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "Some sentence here."
}
