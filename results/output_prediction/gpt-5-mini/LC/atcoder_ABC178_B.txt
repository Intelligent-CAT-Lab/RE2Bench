[THOUGHT]
The program reads four integers a, b, c, d and prints the maximum of the four products: a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.

Input (interpreting the given string as the raw stdin without extra surrounding quotes):
193944314 586260100 -192321079 95834122

So:
a = 193,944,314
b = 586,260,100
c = -192,321,079
d = 95,834,122

Compute each product:

a * c = 193,944,314 * (-192,321,079) = -37,299,579,734,394,806
a * d = 193,944,314 * 95,834,122 = 18,586,483,049,082,308
b * c = 586,260,100 * (-192,321,079) = -112,750,175,006,647,900
b * d = 586,260,100 * 95,834,122 = 56,183,721,947,132,200

The maximum of these four values is 56,183,721,947,132,200 (b * d).
