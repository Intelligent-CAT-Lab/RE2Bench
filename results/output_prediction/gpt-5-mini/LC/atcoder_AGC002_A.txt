[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers a and b.

The provided input corresponds to: 1 1000000000
So a = 1, b = 1000000000.

Evaluate conditions:
- First: a <= 0 and 0 <= b -> 1 <= 0 is False, so the whole condition is False.
- Second: a < 0 and ... -> 1 < 0 is False, so this branch is not taken.
- Else: falls to printing "Positive".

So the output is the string Positive.

{
    "output": "Positive"
