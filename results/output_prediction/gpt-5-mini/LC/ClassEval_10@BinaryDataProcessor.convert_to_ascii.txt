[THOUGHT]
We take the provided self.binary_string "01101000011001010110001001101111".
Split into 8-bit chunks:
- "01101000" -> binary to decimal = 104 -> ASCII 'h'
- "01100101" -> 101 -> 'e'
- "01100010" -> 98  -> 'b'
- "01101111" -> 111 -> 'o'

Joining the characters yields "hebo".

[OUTPUT]

{
    "output": "hebo"        
}
