[THOUGHT]
The function returns number % 1.0, i.e., the fractional part of the input.

Given number = 1.33, the fractional part is 1.33 - 1.0 = 0.33, but due to floating-point representation in Python the result is represented as 0.33000000000000007.

So the function will return 0.33000000000000007.
