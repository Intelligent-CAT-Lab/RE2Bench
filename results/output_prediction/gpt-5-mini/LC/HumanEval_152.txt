[THOUGHT]
We call compare(game, guess).
The function zips game and guess and computes absolute differences elementwise.

Pairs and computations:
- (1, -1) -> abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(2) = 2
- (2, 2)  -> abs(2 - 2) = 0
- (3, 3)  -> abs(3 - 3) = 0
- (5, 4)  -> abs(5 - 4) = 1

So the result list is [2, 0, 0, 1].
