[THOUGHT]
The method attempts to open "read_test_process.csv" for writing and use csv.writer to write the provided rows.
- The data is a list of two rows: ["a","b","c","d"] and ["ME"].
- writer.writerows(data) will write those two rows to the file.
- No errors are raised in this scenario, so the try block completes and the function returns 1.
Therefore the output is 1.
