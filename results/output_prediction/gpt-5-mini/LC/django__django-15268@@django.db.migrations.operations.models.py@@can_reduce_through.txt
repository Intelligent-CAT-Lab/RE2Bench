[THOUGHT]
We call AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label).

1. First part: super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label).
   - The parent class behavior isn't provided. There's no evidence here that the superclass would return True for these inputs (app_label is "otherapp", different from the model name in the instances). So we assume this returns False.

2. Second part: (isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation) and type(operation) is not type(self)).
   - The provided `operation` structure has the same shape as an AlterTogetherOptionOperation instance but represents a different option (index_together) while `self` represents unique_together. That implies `operation` is an instance of AlterTogetherOptionOperation (isinstance(...) is True).
   - Their runtime types are different subclasses (one handles unique_together, the other index_together), so type(operation) is not type(self) is True.

3. The whole expression is super_result or (True and True) => False or True => True.

Therefore the method returns True.
