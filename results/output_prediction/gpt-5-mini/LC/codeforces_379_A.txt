[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads the input string "80 970" and splits it into two integers: a = 80, b = 970.
2. Initialize x = a = 80, h = 0, s = 0.
3. First while loop runs while x > 0. It runs 80 times, each time decrementing x by 1 and incrementing h and s by 1. After this loop: x = 0, h = 80, s = 80.
4. Second while loop condition is while s // b != 0. Compute s // b = 80 // 970 = 0, so the condition is false and this loop does not run.
5. The program prints h, which is 80.
