[THOUGHT]
1. precision_recall_curve calls _binary_clf_curve(y_true=None, y_score=None, pos_label=1, sample_weight=None).
2. _binary_clf_curve starts by computing y_type = type_of_target(y_true).
3. type_of_target(None) checks whether None is array-like: it is not a Sequence, has no __array__, and is not a string, so the validity check fails.
4. Because valid is False, type_of_target raises ValueError("Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r" % y), where y is None.
5. This ValueError propagates out of _binary_clf_curve and thus out of precision_recall_curve; no normal return value is produced.
