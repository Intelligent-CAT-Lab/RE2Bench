[THOUGHT]
We need to run f(text, ch) which returns text.count(ch).

The input text is: "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!"
We're counting the space character " ".

Count spaces between words:
- "This" and "be" -> 1
- "be" and "Pirate's" -> 2
- "Pirate's" and "Speak" -> 3
- "Speak" and "for" -> 4
- "for" and "'help'!" -> 5

No leading/trailing or extra spaces appear, so total count is 5.

    "output": 5
