[THOUGHT]
The signed string has the format "<payload>:<timestamp>:<signature>".

1. Split s on ":":
   - payload = "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9"
   - timestamp = "1u7SIo"
   - signature = "wF3XgnVXy3Uny-ff_G2pL1VcbThKPy56l3Vn9gnoLso"

2. The payload is URL-safe base64 of the serialized object. Decoding "eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9" yields the JSON bytes:
   b'{"a":"dictionary"}'

3. Deserializing that JSON gives the Python object: {"a": "dictionary"}.

4. TimestampSigner.unsign_object (used by loads) would validate the signature using the secret key and timestamp; assuming the signature matches (as it was produced for this payload), it returns the deserialized object.

Therefore the result is the object with key "a" having value "dictionary".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "a": "dictionary"
}
