[THOUGHT]
The program reads the raw input string: "\"FFEE\"" — that is the characters: double-quote, F, F, E, E, double-quote.

sorted(input()) produces a list sorted by ASCII: ['"', '"', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'F'].

Now check conditions:
- s[0] == s[1] -> '"' == '"' is True
- s[2] == s[3] -> 'E' == 'E' is True
- s[0] != s[2] -> '"' != 'E' is True

All conditions hold, so the program prints "Yes".
