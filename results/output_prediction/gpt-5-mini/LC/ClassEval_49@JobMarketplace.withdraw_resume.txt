[THOUGHT]
We call JobMarketplace.withdraw_resume with self.resumes = [] and resume equal to a dict for Tom.

The method does: self.resumes.remove(resume)

Since self.resumes is an empty list, calling list.remove(x) where x is not present raises a ValueError. The exact Python error message is: "list.remove(x): x not in list".

The method does not return a value because the exception is raised before any return.
