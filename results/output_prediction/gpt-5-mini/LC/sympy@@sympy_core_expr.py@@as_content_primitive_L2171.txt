[THOUGHT]
1. The method as_content_primitive simply returns the tuple (S.One, self).
2. The provided self object is {"nargs": "{1}"}.
3. The boolean arguments radical and clear are not used in the body.
4. Representing the returned tuple in JSON: use a two-element array where the first element is "S.One" (symbolic representation of S.One) and the second is the self object.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ["S.One", {"nargs":"{1}"}]        
}
```
