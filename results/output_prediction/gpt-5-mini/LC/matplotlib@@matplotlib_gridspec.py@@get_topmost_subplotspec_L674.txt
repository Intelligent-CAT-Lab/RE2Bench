[THOUGHT]
1. Call get_topmost_subplotspec on the given SubplotSpec instance.
2. Inside get_topmost_subplotspec, it calls get_gridspec(), which returns self._gridspec. That's the string "GridSpec(1, 1)".
3. It then checks hasattr(gridspec, 'get_topmost_subplotspec'). gridspec is a Python string, which does not have that attribute, so the condition is False.
4. Therefore the method returns self (the SubplotSpec instance) unchanged.

So the output is the same object state as the input self.
