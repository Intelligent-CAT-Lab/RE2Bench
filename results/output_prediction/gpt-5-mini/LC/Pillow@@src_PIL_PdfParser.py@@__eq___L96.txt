[THOUGHT]
1. The method evaluates: other.__class__ is self.__class__ and other.object_id == self.object_id and (other.generation == self.generation).
2. other is the list [1, 2], so other.__class__ is the built-in list class.
3. self is an instance of IndirectReference, so self.__class__ is IndirectReference.
4. The identity check other.__class__ is self.__class__ is therefore False (list is not IndirectReference).
5. Python's "and" operator short-circuits, so once the first part is False the rest is not evaluated (avoiding any attribute access on other or self).
6. The method returns False.
