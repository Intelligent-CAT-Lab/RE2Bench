[THOUGHT]
The method checks "if product_id in self.inventory". The inventory's key is the string "1", but the provided product_id is the integer 1. Dict membership requires exact key equality, so 1 is not found in self.inventory. The method body is not executed and there is no return statement, so it returns None (JSON null).
