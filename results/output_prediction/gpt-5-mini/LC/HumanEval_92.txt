[THOUGHT]
1. The function checks that x, y, and z are all instances of int. Here x=2, y=1, z=1 — all are ints.
2. It then checks three conditions:
   - x + y == z → 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
   - x + z == y → 2 + 1 == 1 → 3 == 1 → False
   - y + z == x → 1 + 1 == 2 → 2 == 2 → True
3. Because the third condition is True, the function returns True.
