[THOUGHT]
Let's run the function step by step.

1. Input txt is the string "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8" (contains one newline between "> " and " 8").
2. The function does lines = txt.split('\n'), producing lines = ["#[)[]>[^e>", " 8"].
3. For each line it calls line.center(marker) with marker = -5.
4. str.center(width) when width is less than or equal to len(line) (including negative widths) returns the original string unchanged. So each line remains the same:
   - "#[)[]>[^e>" stays "#[)[]>[^e>"
   - " 8" stays " 8"
5. The function then joins the lines with '\n' and returns the original multiline string "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8".

So the output is the same as the input string with the newline preserved.
