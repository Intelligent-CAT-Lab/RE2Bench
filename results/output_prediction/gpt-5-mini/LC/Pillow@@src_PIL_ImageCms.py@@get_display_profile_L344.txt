[THOUGHT]
1. The function first checks if sys.platform != 'win32'. If that's true it immediately returns None.
2. The provided input has handle = null, but that is irrelevant because the platform check short-circuits.
3. No information indicates we are running on Windows, so we take the common path: sys.platform != 'win32' → return None.
