[THOUGHT]
1. setup is called with app equal to "<SphinxTestApp buildername='html'>".
2. setup calls app.add_env_collector(MetadataCollector). The provided add_env_collector implementation will instantiate MetadataCollector and call its enable method with the app; add_env_collector returns None.
3. setup then returns the metadata dictionary exactly as written in the function: version 'builtin', parallel_read_safe True, parallel_write_safe True.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "version": "builtin",
    "parallel_read_safe": true,
    "parallel_write_safe": true
}
