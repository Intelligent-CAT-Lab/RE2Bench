[THOUGHT]
1. The __eq__ method first checks isinstance(other, CheckConstraint). The provided "other" has the same attribute structure as "self" (name, check, violation_error_code, violation_error_message), so we proceed assuming it is an instance of CheckConstraint.
2. Compare self.name == other.name: "price" == "price" -> True.
3. Compare self.check == other.check: both dicts {"children": None, "connector": "AND", "negated": False} -> True.
4. Compare violation_error_code: "custom_code" == "custom_code" -> True.
5. Compare violation_error_message: both have identical proxy dicts with the same args and kw -> True.
6. All parts combined with and -> True, so __eq__ returns True.
