[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step for n = 3.

1. range(3) produces [0, 1, 2]. reversed(range(3)) will iterate i = 2, then 1, then 0.
2. i = 2: compute 3 % 2 = 1, not zero, so continue.
3. i = 1: compute 3 % 1 = 0, condition is true, so the function returns 1 immediately.

(The loop would reach i = 0 next, but we return before that; note that checking i = 0 would raise a ZeroDivisionError, but it is not reached here.)

Therefore the function returns 1.
