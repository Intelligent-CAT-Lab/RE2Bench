[THOUGHT]
We call extract_all with self.file_name == "" and output_path == "".
The method tries "with zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r') as zip_file:" which attempts to open a file with an empty path.
Opening a ZIP with an empty filename will raise an exception (FileNotFoundError / OSError). The except: clause catches all exceptions and the function returns False.
So the output is False.

    "output": false
