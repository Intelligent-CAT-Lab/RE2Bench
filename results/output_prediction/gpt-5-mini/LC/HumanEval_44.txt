[THOUGHT]
We call change_base(4, 5).

1. Initialize ret = ''.
2. Loop condition: x > 0 -> 4 > 0 is True.
   - Compute x % base = 4 % 5 = 4.
   - Update ret = str(4) + '' = '4'.
   - Update x //= base -> x = 4 // 5 = 0.
3. Loop condition: x > 0 -> 0 > 0 is False, exit loop.
4. Return ret which is '4'.
