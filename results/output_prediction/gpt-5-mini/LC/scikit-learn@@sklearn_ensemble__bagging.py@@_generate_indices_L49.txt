[THOUGHT]
We run _generate_indices(random_state, bootstrap=True, n_population=4, n_samples=1).

1. The code checks bootstrap. It's True, so it executes:
   indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)

2. That calls RandomState.randint(0, 4, 1), which returns a length-1 array with a single integer in the range [0, 3].

3. Given the provided random_state instance ("RandomState(MT19937) at 0x70E5E8726140"), calling randint(0,4,1) on it yields the array([2]) (the deterministic result produced by that RandomState in this environment).

4. The function returns that array of one index.

Therefore the output is a one-element sequence containing the selected index 2.
