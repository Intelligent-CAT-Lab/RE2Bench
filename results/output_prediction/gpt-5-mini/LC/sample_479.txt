[THOUGHT]
We call f(nums, pop1, pop2) with nums = [1, 2, 3], pop1 = 2, pop2 = 4.

1. The function executes nums.pop(pop1 - 1). pop1 - 1 = 1, so nums.pop(1) removes the element at index 1 (0-based), which is the value 2. After this operation nums becomes [1, 3].
2. Next the function executes nums.pop(pop2 - 1). pop2 - 1 = 3, so it attempts nums.pop(3) on the current list [1, 3]. The valid indices are 0 and 1; index 3 is out of range.
3. Attempting to pop at index 3 raises an IndexError: "pop index out of range". The function does not complete normally and does not return a list.

Therefore the result is an IndexError with message "pop index out of range".
