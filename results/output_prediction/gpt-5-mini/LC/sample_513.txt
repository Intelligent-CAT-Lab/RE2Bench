[THOUGHT]
We call f with array = [].

Step-by-step:
1. Check `while -1 in array`: array is empty, so -1 not in array — this loop is skipped.
2. Check `while 0 in array`: array is empty, so 0 not in array — this loop is skipped.
3. Check `while 1 in array`: array is empty, so 1 not in array — this loop is skipped.
4. Return array, which is still the empty list [].
