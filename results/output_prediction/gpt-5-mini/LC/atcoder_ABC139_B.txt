[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads a line and splits it into two integers t and h.
2. The provided input "\"8 9\"" is the JSON-escaped representation of the text: 8 9. So the program sees "8 9".
3. map(int, input().split()) gives t = 8, h = 9.
4. Compute (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 = (9 - 2) // (8 - 1) + 1 = 7 // 7 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
5. The program prints 2.
