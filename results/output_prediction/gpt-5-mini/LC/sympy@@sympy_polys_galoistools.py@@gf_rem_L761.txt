[THOUGHT]
gf_rem returns the remainder part of gf_div(f, g, p, K).

Interpret coefficient lists as highest-degree-first (SymPy convention). f = [2, 0] has degree df = 1. g = [1, 0, 1] has degree dg = 2. Since df < dg, gf_div returns (quotient=[], remainder=f) without performing division. Therefore gf_rem returns f unchanged: [2, 0].
