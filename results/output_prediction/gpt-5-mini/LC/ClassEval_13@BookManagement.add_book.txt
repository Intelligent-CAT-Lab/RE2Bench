[THOUGHT]
We call add_book on a BookManagement instance whose inventory is {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}.
The method parameters are title="book2" and quantity defaults to 1.
Inside add_book: since "book2" is already a key in inventory, it increments inventory["book2"] by 1 (from 1 to 2).
The method has no return statement, so it returns None.
Therefore the output (the function return value) is null in JSON.

    "output": null
