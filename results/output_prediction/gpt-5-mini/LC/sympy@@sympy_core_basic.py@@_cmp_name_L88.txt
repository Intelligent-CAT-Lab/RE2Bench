[THOUGHT]
1. The function reads class names:
   - n1 = x.__name__ -> "ImaginaryUnit"
   - n2 = y.__name__ -> "Pi"

2. It checks if the names are equal: they are not.

3. It checks if y is a subclass of Basic: Pi is a SymPy core class and is a subclass of Basic, so the check passes (we do not return -1 here).

4. It then attempts to find the indices of "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi" in ordering_of_classes. We have no information that either name is present in ordering_of_classes, so both indices are treated as UNKNOWN.

5. If both are UNKNOWN, the function compares the names lexicographically:
   - Compare "ImaginaryUnit" and "Pi": "ImaginaryUnit" < "Pi" (since 'I' < 'P'), so the expression (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2) evaluates to 0 - 1 = -1.

6. Therefore the function returns -1.
