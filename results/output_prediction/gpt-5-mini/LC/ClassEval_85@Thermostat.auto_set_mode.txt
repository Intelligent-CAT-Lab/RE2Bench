[THOUGHT]
We have a Thermostat instance with:
- current_temperature = 25
- target_temperature = 25
- mode = "cool"

Call auto_set_mode():
- The method checks if current_temperature < target_temperature.
- 25 < 25 is False, so it goes to the else branch and sets self.mode = 'cool'.
- self.mode was already "cool", so it remains "cool".
- The method has no return statement, so it returns None (which corresponds to null in JSON).

Therefore the output (the return value of auto_set_mode) is None/null.
