[THOUGHT]
We call FunctionTypeSerializer.serialize with self.value set to the string "\"<function time>\"" (i.e., a Python str whose value is the characters "<function time>" wrapped in quotes).

Step-by-step through the method:

1. The first if checks getattr(self.value, '__self__', None) and isinstance(..., type). For a plain str, getattr(self.value, '__self__', None) returns None, so this branch is skipped.

2. The next line directly accesses self.value.__name__ to compare with '<lambda>'. A str object does not have a __name__ attribute, so attempting to evaluate self.value.__name__ raises an AttributeError.

Therefore serialize does not return a normal value; it raises an AttributeError with the message: 'str' object has no attribute '__name__'.

This is the outcome to report.
