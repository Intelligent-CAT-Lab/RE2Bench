[THOUGHT]
precision_score calls precision_recall_fscore_support with y_true=None, y_pred=None.

precision_recall_fscore_support starts by calling _check_targets(y_true, y_pred).

_check_targets first calls check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred), which calls _num_samples on each argument.

_num_samples(None) checks whether None has __len__ or shape or __array__; it has none of these, so it raises a TypeError with message "Expected sequence or array-like, got <class 'NoneType'>".

This exception is not caught inside precision_recall_fscore_support, so precision_score raises the same TypeError with that message.
