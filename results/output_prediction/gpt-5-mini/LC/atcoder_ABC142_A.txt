[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads a line and converts it to an integer: N = int("99") -> N = 99.
2. Check parity: 99 % 2 == 1, so N is odd; the else branch runs.
3. Compute (N + 1) / N / 2 = 100 / 99 / 2.
   - 100 / 99 = 1.0101010101010102
   - 1.0101010101010102 / 2 = 0.5050505050505051
4. The program prints the floating-point result: 0.5050505050505051.
