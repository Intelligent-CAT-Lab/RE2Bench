Let's break down the execution of the `__contains__` method step by step based on the provided inputs.

1. **Initialization of `__contains__`**:
   - The `__contains__` method is called with `item="<Version('1.0a1')>"`. The instance `self` has `_specs` as an empty `frozenset` (meaning no version specifiers are defined) and `_prereleases=True` (meaning it is configured to include prereleases).

2. **Call to `contains`**:
   - Inside `__contains__`, it immediately calls the `contains` method, passing along the `item` and any default parameters (since `kwargs` is empty). This means `contains` is invoked with `item="<Version('1.0a1')>", prereleases=None, installed=None`.

3. **Inside `contains`**:
   - The first step in `contains` is to call `_coerce_version(item)`. Assuming `item` is a valid version string or object, this will parse it into a `Version` object. For the input `"<Version('1.0a1')>"`, this results in a `Version` object representing version `1.0a1`.
   - Since `version` is not `None`, the method proceeds.
   - The `installed` parameter is `None`, so the condition `if installed and version.is_prerelease` is skipped.
   - The method then calls `self.filter([version], prereleases=prereleases)` and checks if the resulting iterator is non-empty by converting it to a list and applying `bool` to it.

4. **Inside `filter`**:
   - The `filter` method is called with `iterable=[version]` (a list containing the parsed `Version` object for `1.0a1`) and `prereleases=None`.
   - Since `self._specs` is an empty `frozenset`, the method enters the `else` block.
   - The `prereleases` parameter is `None`, so it checks the `self.prereleases` property. Since `self._prereleases` is `True`, it returns an iterator over the `iterable` (which contains the `Version` object `1.0a1`).

5. **Returning from `filter`**:
   - The `filter` method returns an iterator containing the `Version` object `1.0a1`.
   - Converting this iterator to a list results in a non-empty list, so `bool(list(...))` returns `True`.

6. **Final Return**:
   - The `contains` method returns `True`, which is the result of `__contains__`.
