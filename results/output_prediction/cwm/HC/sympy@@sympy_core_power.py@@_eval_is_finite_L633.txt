The function `_eval_is_finite` is being called on an instance of the `Pow` class, specifically `cos(phi)**2`. Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. **Check if the exponent is negative:**
   - The exponent is `2`, which is not negative. Therefore, the condition `if self.exp.is_negative:` is false, and this block is skipped.

2. **Evaluate `c1 = self.base.is_finite`:**
   - The base of the power is `cos(phi)`. The `is_finite` property of `cos(phi)` is `None` because `phi` is a symbol, and the finiteness of `cos(phi)` cannot be determined without additional context. So, `c1 = None`.

3. **Check if `c1` is `None`:**
   - Since `c1` is `None`, the function returns immediately without further evaluation.

Therefore, the function `_eval_is_finite` returns `None` because the finiteness of the base `cos(phi)` cannot be determined.
