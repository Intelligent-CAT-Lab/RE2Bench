The input expression is "n + n**(-n)". The simplify function will process this expression step by step.

1. The function first converts the input expression into a SymPy expression object using sympify. This gives us `n + n**(-n)`.

2. Since the expression is an Add object (n + n**(-n)), the function will attempt to simplify each argument individually. It will call simplify on each term: `n` and `n**(-n)`.

3. For the term `n`, since it's a Symbol object and not a Basic object with arguments, the function will return it as is.

4. For the term `n**(-n)`, the function will call simplify on it. Since `n**(-n)` is a Pow object, the function will attempt to simplify it using various methods like powsimp, factor_terms, etc. However, since `n` is a variable and not a number, these simplifications won't change the expression.

5. After simplifying both terms, the function will combine them back into an Add object: `n + n**(-n)`.

6. The function will then check if the simplified expression is shorter (has fewer operations) than the original expression. Since the original expression and the simplified expression are the same, it will keep the simplified expression.

7. Finally, the function will return the simplified expression, which is `n + n**(-n)`.
