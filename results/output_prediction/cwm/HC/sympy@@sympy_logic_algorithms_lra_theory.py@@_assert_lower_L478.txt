The `_assert_lower` function is being called with the following arguments:
- `xi`: an object representing the variable 'x'
- `ci`: a tuple (0, 0)
- `from_equality`: True
- `from_neg`: False

Inside the function:
1. It checks if `self.result` is not None. Since `self.result` is None, it proceeds.
2. Sets `self.result` to None.
3. Compares `ci` (0, 0) with `xi.lower`. Assuming `xi.lower` is not less than or equal to `ci`, the function continues.
4. Checks if `ci` is greater than `xi.upper`. If true, it would create a conflict, but since `ci` is (0, 0), it likely proceeds.
5. Updates `xi.lower` to `ci` (0, 0), and sets `xi.lower_from_eq` to True and `xi.lower_from_neg` to False.
6. If `xi` is in `self.nonslack` (which it is, since `self.nonslack` contains 'x') and `xi.assign` is less than `ci`, it calls `_update(xi, ci)`.
   - In `_update`, it updates all slack variables (though there are none in this case) and sets `xi.assign` to `ci` (0, 0).
7. Since `self.run_checks` is False, it skips the assertion check.
8. Returns None.
