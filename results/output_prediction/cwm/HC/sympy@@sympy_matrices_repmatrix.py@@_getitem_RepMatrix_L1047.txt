Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The function `_getitem_RepMatrix` is called with `self` being a RepMatrix instance and `key` being `[0, 0]`.
2. Since `key` is not a tuple, the code checks if it's a slice or a sequence. Here, `key` is a list, which is a sequence.
3. The code then checks if the matrix is empty (rows * cols == 0). In this case, the matrix is 3x3, so it's not empty.
4. The code retrieves the domain of the matrix's representation (`EXRAW`) and checks if `key` is a slice. Since `key` is a list, it's not a slice.
5. The code then calculates the values at the indices specified by `key`. Since `key` is `[0, 0]`, it's trying to access the element at row 0, column 0.
6. The domain is `EXRAW`, so the code doesn't need to convert the values to SymPy objects.
7. The code returns the value at the specified index, which is `cos(phi)`.

So, the output of the function should be `cos(phi)`.
