Step 1: The function `_print_Pow` is called with `expr` being a Power object representing sqrt(2) and `rational=False`.

Step 2: It checks if `expr.exp` is equal to `S.Half` (which represents 1/2) and if `rational` is False. Since both conditions are true, it proceeds to return the string representation of the square root.

Step 3: The square root of `expr.base` (which is 2) is computed using the `_print` method of the `StrPrinter` class.

Step 4: Since the `_print` method is called with `expr.base` (which is 2), it will return the string "2".

Step 5: Finally, the function returns the string "sqrt(2)".
