1. The function _fit is called with X, y, and step_score as parameters. X is a 2D array of shape (1, 100) and y is a 1D array of length 100. The estimator is an SVC with a linear kernel, n_features_to_select is 4, step is 0.1, and importance_getter is 'auto'.

2. The function validate_data is called to validate the input data. It checks if X and y are valid and sets the n_features_in_ attribute of the estimator.

3. The number of features in X is 100. Since n_features_to_select is 4, the function will select 4 features.

4. The step parameter is 0.1, which is less than 1. So, the step size is calculated as int(max(1, 0.1 * 100)) = 10.

5. The support_ array is initialized as an array of True values of length 100, indicating that all features are initially selected. The ranking_ array is initialized as an array of 1s of length 100, indicating the ranking of each feature.

6. The while loop runs until the number of selected features is less than or equal to n_features_to_select (4). In each iteration, the estimator is cloned and fitted on the current selected features.

7. The feature importances are calculated using _get_feature_importances. Since the estimator is an SVC with a linear kernel, the feature importances are the absolute values of the coefficients of the linear SVM.

8. The features with the lowest importances are removed from the support_ array, and their rankings are updated in the ranking_ array.

9. This process is repeated until the number of selected features is 4.

10. Finally, the estimator is cloned and fitted on the selected features, and the selected features, their rankings, and the number of selected features are stored in the estimator's attributes.
