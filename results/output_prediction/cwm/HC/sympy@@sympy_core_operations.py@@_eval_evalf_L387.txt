Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Input**: The input provided is for the `_eval_evalf` method, with `self` being an expression representing `-sqrt(30)/30` and `prec` (precision) set to 2.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The method `_eval_evalf` is defined in the `sympy.sympy.core.operations` module. It handles the evaluation of expressions with a given precision.
   - This function first checks if `self` is an instance of `Mul` or `Add`. If so, it attempts to separate the expression into independent parts (numbers and non-numbers) and evaluates the number parts with the given precision.

3. **Expression Separation**:
   - The expression `-sqrt(30)/30` can be viewed as a `Mul` object (since it's a product of two terms: `-1` and `sqrt(30)/30`).
   - The `as_independent` method is called with `Symbol` and `AppliedUndef` as dependencies. This method separates the expression into parts that are independent of the dependencies (in this case, there are no symbols or undefined functions, so the entire expression is considered independent).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Since the expression is a `Mul`, the function `as_independent` returns `(x, tail)`, where `x` is the independent part and `tail` is the dependent part. In this case, `x` would be the coefficient `-1`, and `tail` would be the remaining part `sqrt(30)/30`.
   - The coefficient `x` is evaluated with the given precision using `x._evalf(prec)`. However, since `-1` is already a number, it remains unchanged.
   - The `tail` part (`sqrt(30)/30`) is processed by calling `_eval_evalf` on each of its arguments. This would involve evaluating `sqrt(30)` and then dividing by 30, both with the specified precision.

5. **Precision Consideration**:
   - The precision `prec=2` implies that the result should be accurate to 2 significant figures.
   - The square root of 30 is approximately 5.477, so `sqrt(30)/30` is roughly 0.18226. With a precision of 2, this would round to 0.18.
   - Multiplying by `-1` gives `-0.18`.

6. **Final Result**:
   - Combining these steps, the final evaluated result of `-sqrt(30)/30` with a precision of 2 would be `-0.18`.

Therefore, the output of the `_eval_evalf` function, given the input, should be `-0.18`.
