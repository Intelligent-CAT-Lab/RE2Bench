First, the function `delete_masked_points` is called with a single argument `args`, which is a string representing a list of lists and a `null` value. The first step is to check if `args` is a sequence. Since `args` is a string, it is considered a scalar or string, and the function `is_scalar_or_string` returns `True`. Therefore, a `ValueError` is raised because the first argument must be a sequence, not a scalar or string.
