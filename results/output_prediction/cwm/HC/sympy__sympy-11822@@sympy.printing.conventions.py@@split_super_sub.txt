Let's break down how the `split_super_sub` function will process the input "Fvec".

1. The function starts by initializing variables: `pos` is set to 0, `name` is `None`, `supers` and `subs` are empty lists.

2. The while loop starts, and since `pos` (0) is less than the length of "Fvec" (4), it proceeds.

3. `start` is calculated as `pos + 1`, so `start` is 1.

4. The code checks for consecutive underscores starting at `pos`, but "Fvec" doesn't start with '__', so `start` remains 1.

5. It then searches for the next '^' or '_' in "Fvec" starting from position 1. Neither is found, so both `pos_hat` and `pos_usc` are set to 4 (the length of "Fvec").

6. The minimum of `pos_hat` and `pos_usc` is 4, so `pos_next` is 4.

7. `part` is assigned the substring from `pos` to `pos_next`, which is "Fvec".

8. `pos` is updated to `pos_next`, which is 4.

9. Since `name` is currently `None`, it is set to "Fvec".

10. The while loop checks again if `pos` (4) is less than the length of "Fvec" (4), which it is not, so the loop ends.

11. The function then checks if `name` ("Fvec") matches the regular expression pattern `_name_with_digits_p`. This pattern looks for a string that starts with letters followed by digits. "Fvec" doesn't match this pattern because it doesn't contain any digits.

12. Since there's no match, the function simply returns the tuple `(name, supers, subs)`, which is ("Fvec", [], []).

So, the final output will be a tuple where the first element is "Fvec", and the second and third elements are empty lists.
