1. The function `__eq__` is called with `self` (an object) and `b` (a string "RBF(length_scale=1)"). 
2. The first line of the function checks if the types of `self` and `b` are the same. Since `self` is an object (specifically an instance of a class that inherits from `Kernel`) and `b` is a string, `type(self) != type(b)` evaluates to `True`.
3. Because the types are different, the function immediately returns `False` without further comparisons.
