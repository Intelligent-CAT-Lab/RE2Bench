Step 1: The function `_eval_pos_neg` is called with `self` as "-phi" and `sign` as 1.
Step 2: Initialize `saw_NON` and `saw_NOT` to False.
Step 3: Iterate through `self.args`, which is "-phi".
Step 4: Since "-phi" is not `is_extended_positive`, check if it's `is_extended_negative`.
Step 5: "-phi" is `is_extended_negative`, so `sign` becomes -1.
Step 6: The loop continues, but there are no more arguments to process.
Step 7: Check if `sign` is 1 and both `saw_NON` and `saw_NOT` are False. Since `sign` is -1, this condition fails.
Step 8: Check if `sign` is less than 0. Since it is, return False.
