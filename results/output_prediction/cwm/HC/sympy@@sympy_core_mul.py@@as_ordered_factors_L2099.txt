Step 1: The `as_ordered_factors` method is called with `self` as "w*z" and `order` as null.
Step 2: The method calls `self.args_cnc()`, which separates the arguments into commutative and non-commutative parts.
Step 3: Since both "w" and "z" are commutative (they are symbols), they are placed in the `cpart` list.
Step 4: The `cpart` list is then sorted using the `sort_key` method. However, since the `order` is null, the default sorting key is used, which for symbols is based on their name.
Step 5: The sorted `cpart` list is then combined with the `ncpart` list (which is empty in this case) to form the final result.
