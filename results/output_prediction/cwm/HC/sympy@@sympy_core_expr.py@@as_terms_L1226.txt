Let's break down the execution of the `as_terms` method step by step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `gens_set` is initialized as an empty set.
   - `terms` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Iteration over terms**:
   - The input expression is "-w**2 - x**2 + y**2 + z**2".
   - `Add.make_args(self)` splits this expression into individual terms: `[-w**2, -x**2, y**2, z**2]`.

3. **Processing each term**:
   - For each term, `as_coeff_Mul()` is called to separate the coefficient and the remaining part of the term.
     - For `-w**2`, `as_coeff_Mul()` returns `(-1, w**2)`.
     - For `-x**2`, `as_coeff_Mul()` returns `(-1, x**2)`.
     - For `y**2`, `as_coeff_Mul()` returns `(1, y**2)`.
     - For `z**2`, `as_coeff_Mul()` returns `(1, z**2)`.

4. **Coefficient handling**:
   - The coefficient is converted to a complex number (`coeff_complex`).
   - For `-w**2` and `-x**2`, `coeff_complex` is `(-1+0j)`.
   - For `y**2` and `z**2`, `coeff_complex` is `(1+0j)`.

5. **Factor decomposition**:
   - Each factor in the term is checked.
   - If a factor is a number, it's multiplied into `coeff_complex`.
   - If a factor is commutative (like `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`), it's decomposed into base and exponent using `decompose_power()`.
   - The base is added to `gens_set`, and the exponent is stored in `cpart`.

6. **Non-commutative factors**:
   - Any non-commutative factors are added to `ncpart`.

7. **Term assembly**:
   - After processing all factors, the term is stored in `terms` along with its coefficient tuple, `cpart`, and `ncpart`.

8. **Sorting generators**:
   - `gens_set` contains the bases of all commutative factors: `{'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}`.
   - These are sorted using `default_sort_key()` to get a consistent order: `['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']`.

9. **Index mapping**:
   - An index dictionary is created to map each generator to its position in the sorted list: `{'w': 0, 'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}`.

10. **Final term construction**:
    - For each term, a monomial is constructed based on the exponents of the generators.
    - The term, along with its coefficient tuple, monomial, and non-commutative parts, is added to the result.

11. **Return value**:
    - The method returns a tuple containing the list of terms and the sorted generators.

The final output will be a tuple where each term is represented along with its coefficient, monomial, and non-commutative parts, and the sorted list of generators.
