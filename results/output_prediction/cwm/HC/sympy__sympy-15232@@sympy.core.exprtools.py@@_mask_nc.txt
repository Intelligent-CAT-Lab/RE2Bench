1. The function `_mask_nc` is called with an expression `eq` as a string `"sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1"`.

2. Since `eq` is a string, it will be evaluated to an expression using the `sympify` function (if applicable), but in this case, it's treated as a string and not processed further in the provided code snippet.

3. The function checks if `eq` is commutative by calling `eq.is_commutative`. In this case, the expression `"sin(Sum(x, (x, 1, 2))) + 1"` is a string and not a SymPy expression, so `is_commutative` will likely return `False` or raise an error. However, the provided code doesn't handle the case where `eq` is a string, so this might be an oversight.

4. Since `eq` is not commutative (or the check fails), the function proceeds to replace non-commutative objects with dummies.

5. The function uses `preorder_traversal` to traverse the expression tree. However, since `eq` is a string, this will likely fail or return an empty traversal.

6. The function checks for non-commutative symbols or objects in the traversal. Since there are no symbols or objects in the string, this step will not find anything.

7. The function returns the original expression (as a string), an empty substitution dictionary, and an empty list of non-commutative symbols.

So, the output will be the original string expression, an empty dictionary, and an empty list.
