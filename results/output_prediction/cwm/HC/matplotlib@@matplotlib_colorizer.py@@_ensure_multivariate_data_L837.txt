1. The function `_ensure_multivariate_data` is called with `data` being a dictionary and `n_components=1`.
2. The first check is if `data` is an instance of `np.ndarray`. Since it's a dictionary, this condition fails.
3. Next, it checks if `n_components > 1` and `len(data) == n_components`. Here, `n_components=1`, so this condition also fails.
4. Then, it checks if `n_components == 1`. This condition is true.
5. Since `n_components == 1`, the function directly returns the `data` as it is, without any modifications.
