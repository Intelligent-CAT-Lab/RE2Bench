The function `type_of_target` is called with the input `y = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, `input_name = ""`, and `raise_unknown = False`. 

First, the function checks if `y` is an array-like object. It is a list, so this check passes.

Next, it checks if `y` is a sparse or pandas data structure. Since `y` is a simple list, these checks fail.

The function then checks if `y` is in a multilabel format by calling `is_multilabel(y)`. This function checks if `y` is a 2D array with more than one column, which is not the case here. So, it returns `False`.

The function proceeds to validate `y` using `check_array` with specific parameters. Since `y` is a list of integers, `check_array` converts it into a numpy array.

The function then checks the dimensionality of `y`. Since `y` is a 1D array, it checks if the shape is valid. The shape is valid (1D), so it proceeds.

Next, it checks if the minimum shape is non-zero. Since the array has 4 elements, this check passes.

The function then checks if the data type is object and not a string. Since the data type is integer, this check is skipped.

It checks if the array is 2D and has more than one column. Since it's 1D, this check is skipped.

The function checks if the data type is a real floating point. Since it's integer, this check is skipped.

It checks if the first row (or value) is sparse. Since it's not, this check is skipped.

The function then checks the number of unique values in `y`. Since there are only two unique values (0 and 1), it returns 'binary'.
