The function `__sklearn_tags__` is being called on a `Pipeline` object with two steps. 

1. The function starts by calling `super().__sklearn_tags__()`, which returns a `Tags` object with default values.
2. It checks if `self.steps` is not empty. Since there are two steps, it proceeds.
3. It tries to update the `pairwise` tag of `tags.input_tags` based on the first step's `input_tags.pairwise`. However, since `self.steps[0][1]` is a string representing a `KernelPCA` object, calling `get_tags(self.steps[0][1])` will raise an error because `KernelPCA` is not an estimator object but a string. The error is caught, and this part is skipped.
4. It then tries to update the `sparse` tag of `tags.input_tags` by checking if all steps (excluding "passthrough") have `input_tags.sparse` as True. Again, since the steps are strings, calling `get_tags(step)` will raise an error, and this part is also skipped.
5. It then tries to update the tags based on the last step. Since `self.steps[-1][1]` is a string representing a `Perceptron` object, calling `get_tags(self.steps[-1][1])` will also raise an error, and this part is skipped.
6. Finally, the function returns the `tags` object with its default values.
