1. The function `sympify` is called with the input string "2500/pi" and the `strict` parameter set to `True`.
2. Since the input is a string, the function checks if it's a SymPy expression by checking for the `__sympy__` attribute, but it's not present.
3. The function then checks if the input is an instance of a class that has a registered converter in the `converter` dictionary, but "2500/pi" is a string, and there's no converter for strings.
4. The function checks if the input is an instance of a class that can be converted to a SymPy expression, but "2500/pi" is a string, and it's not an instance of any such class.
5. The function checks if the input is a NumPy instance, but "2500/pi" is a string, and it's not a NumPy instance.
6. The function then tries to parse the input string as a SymPy expression using the `parse_expr` function.
7. The `parse_expr` function is called with the input string "2500/pi", and it returns a SymPy expression representing the value of "2500/pi".
8. The function returns the parsed SymPy expression as the output.
