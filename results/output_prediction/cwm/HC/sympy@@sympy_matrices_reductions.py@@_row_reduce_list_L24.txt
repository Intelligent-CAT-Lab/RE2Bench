1. The function `_row_reduce_list` starts by defining three nested helper functions: `get_col`, `row_swap`, and `cross_cancel`. These functions are used to manipulate the input matrix `mat` according to the row reduction algorithm.

2. The variable `isimp` is assigned the result of calling `_get_intermediate_simp(_dotprodsimp)`. This function likely returns a simplification function based on global settings, which will be used to simplify expressions during the row reduction process.

3. The variables `piv_row`, `piv_col`, `pivot_cols`, and `swaps` are initialized to keep track of the current pivot row, pivot column, the list of pivot columns, and the list of row swaps performed, respectively.

4. The main loop of the function begins, which continues as long as `piv_col` is less than `cols` and `piv_row` is less than `rows`. In each iteration, it attempts to find a reasonable pivot in the current column using the `_find_reasonable_pivot` function.

5. The `_find_reasonable_pivot` function is called with the current column (starting from `piv_row`) and the `iszerofunc` and `simpfunc` provided as arguments. It returns a tuple containing the pivot offset, pivot value, a boolean indicating if the pivot was assumed to be non-zero, and a list of newly determined values.

6. If a pivot is found (i.e., `pivot_offset` is not `None`), the pivot column is added to `pivot_cols`. If the pivot offset is not zero, the current row is swapped with the row containing the pivot, and this swap is recorded in `swaps`.

7. The function then normalizes the pivot row if `normalize_last` is `True` and the pivot value is not commutative. This involves setting the pivot element to `one` and scaling the rest of the row accordingly.

8. The function then iterates over all rows, skipping the current pivot row. For each row, it checks if the element in the current pivot column is zero using `iszerofunc`. If it's not zero, it performs a row operation to eliminate the element below (or above, depending on `zero_above`) the pivot using the `cross_cancel` function.

9. After processing all rows for the current pivot, `piv_row` is incremented to move to the next row.

10. Once the main loop completes, if `normalize_last` and `normalize` are both `True`, the function normalizes the pivot columns by setting each pivot element to `one` and scaling the rest of the row accordingly.

11. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified matrix `mat`, the list of pivot columns `pivot_cols`, and the list of row swaps `swaps`.

Given the input matrix and parameters, the function will perform Gaussian elimination to reduce the matrix to row echelon form, keeping track of the pivot columns and row swaps. The output will be the modified matrix along with the pivot columns and row swaps.
