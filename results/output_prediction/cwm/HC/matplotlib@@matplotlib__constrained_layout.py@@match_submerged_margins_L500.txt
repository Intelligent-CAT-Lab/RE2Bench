1. The function `match_submerged_margins` is called with a `layoutgrids` dictionary and a `fig` object. The `layoutgrids` dictionary contains information about the layout grids, and the `fig` object represents a figure with 2 axes.

2. The function starts by initializing an empty list `axsdone` to keep track of processed axes. Since `fig.subfigs` is empty (no subfigures), the loop over `sfig in fig.subfigs` does nothing.

3. Next, the function creates a list `axs` of axes that are part of the layout and not in `axsdone`. This list will contain the two axes in the figure.

4. The function then iterates over each axis `ax1` in `axs`. For each axis, it retrieves the subplot specification `ss1` and checks if the corresponding grid specification is in `layoutgrids`. If not, the axis is removed from `axs` and the loop continues.

5. For each axis `ax1`, the function checks if the axis spans multiple columns or rows. If it does, it calculates the maximum submerged margin values for the left, right, top, and bottom margins.

6. The function then iterates over the other axes `ax2` in `axs` to find the maximum submerged margin values. If `ax2` also spans multiple columns or rows, it updates the maximum values if necessary.

7. After calculating the maximum submerged margin values, the function edits the margin values for the corresponding cells in the layout grid using the `edit_margin_min` method.

8. Finally, the function returns the list `axs` of processed axes.
