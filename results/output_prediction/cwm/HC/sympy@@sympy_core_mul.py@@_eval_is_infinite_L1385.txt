Let's think through the execution of `_eval_is_infinite` for the input "pi/2".

1. The function `_eval_is_infinite` is called on `self`, which represents the expression "pi/2". This function checks if the product represented by `self` is infinite.

2. The first step in `_eval_is_infinite` is to call the helper function `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`, which evaluates whether any of the arguments in the multiplication are zero or infinite, and returns a tuple `(seen_zero, seen_infinite)`.

3. Inside `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper`, the function iterates over `self.args`, which are the arguments of the multiplication. Since `self` is "pi/2", the arguments are likely `pi` and `2` (assuming "pi/2" is a symbolic representation of π divided by 2).

4. For each argument `a` in `self.args`, the function checks:
   - If `a.is_zero` is True, indicating the argument is zero.
   - If `a.is_infinite` is True, indicating the argument is infinite.
   - If neither is True, it checks if `a.is_zero` or `a.is_infinite` could be None (unknown).

5. Let's consider the properties of `pi` and `2`:
   - `pi` is a symbolic constant representing π. Its `is_zero` and `is_infinite` properties are likely None (unknown).
   - `2` is a finite number. Its `is_zero` is False (since 2 ≠ 0) and `is_infinite` is also False (since 2 is not infinite).

6. Processing `pi`:
   - `a.is_zero` is None (unknown).
   - `a.is_infinite` is None (unknown).
   - Since `seen_zero` is False and `a.is_zero` is None, `seen_zero` is set to None.
   - Similarly, since `seen_infinite` is False and `a.is_infinite` is None, `seen_infinite` is set to None.

7. Processing `2`:
   - `a.is_zero` is False.
   - `a.is_infinite` is False.
   - No changes to `seen_zero` or `seen_infinite` because they are already None.

8. After processing all arguments, `_eval_is_zero_infinite_helper` returns `(seen_zero, seen_infinite) = (None, None)`.

9. Back in `_eval_is_infinite`, the returned values are assigned to `seen_zero` and `seen_infinite`.

10. The function then checks:
    - If `seen_infinite` is True and `seen_zero` is False, return True (infinite).
    - If `seen_infinite` is False, return False (not infinite).
    - Otherwise, return None (unknown).

11. Since `seen_infinite` is None, the function returns None.
