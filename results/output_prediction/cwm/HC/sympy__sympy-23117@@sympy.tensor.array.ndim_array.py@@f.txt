The function `f` is defined inside `_scan_iterable_shape`, which is a method of the `NDimArray` class. Let's break down the function call with the provided input.

1. The `pointer` argument is `"sin(x)**2 + \"cos(x)\"**2"`, a string.
2. Since the string is not an instance of `Iterable` (it's not a list, tuple, or other iterable), the condition `if not isinstance(pointer, Iterable):` evaluates to `True`.
3. The function returns `([pointer], ())`, where `pointer` is the original string. This converts the string into a singleton list (["sin(x)**2 + \"cos(x)\"**2"]) and an empty tuple for the shape.

The returned value is thus a tuple containing a list with the string and an empty tuple.
