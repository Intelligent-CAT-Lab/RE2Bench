Inside the `transform` method of `SelectorMixin`, we first check for `output_config_dense`. Since no output configuration is specified, the default output is expected to be a dense array. Next, the code validates the input `X` using the `_validate_data` method, ensuring that it is a NumPy array or a sparse CSR matrix. The `_validate_data` function handles checks such as ensuring the data is 2D, contains no complex numbers, and meets minimum sample and feature requirements. Since the input data is empty (`X`: null), it is treated as a sparse array or an empty array without specific feature names.

The code then calls the `_transform` method, which applies a mask obtained from `get_support()` to the input data. The mask is determined by the `scores_` and `pvalues_` attributes of the instance, which, in this case, indicate that only the third feature is selected (as `scores_` and `pvalues_` are `[0 0 1]`). 

Because the input `X` is null, the resulting transformed data will be an empty array with the same number of samples as `X` (which is unknown, but defaults to 0 or whatever is inferred by the `check_array` function when given a null input) and only one feature (since only the third feature is selected). Therefore, the output will be an empty array with shape (number_of_samples, 1). Given the null input, it's reasonable to assume that the output will also be empty, leading to an output array with 0 samples and 1 feature.

Finally, the `_safe_indexing` function is used to apply the mask to the input data, resulting in the final transformed output.
