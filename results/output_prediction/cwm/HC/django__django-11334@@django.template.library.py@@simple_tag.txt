<think>
1. The `simple_tag` function is called with `func={}` (a dictionary) and no other arguments.
2. Since `func` is not `None` but not callable (a dictionary is not a function), the condition `elif callable(func):` is not met.
3. The function then raises a `ValueError` with the message "Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag".
