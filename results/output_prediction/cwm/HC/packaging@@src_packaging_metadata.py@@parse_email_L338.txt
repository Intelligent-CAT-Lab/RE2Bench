Step 1: The function `parse_email` is called with the argument `data="download-url: VaLuE"`.

Step 2: Since `data` is a string, the function uses `email.parser.Parser(policy=email.policy.compat32).parsestr(data)` to parse the email data.

Step 3: The parsed email object is iterated over to extract headers. The first header is `download-url` with the value `VaLuE`.

Step 4: The value `VaLuE` is processed as a string and added to the `value` list.

Step 5: The `raw_name` for `download-url` is `None` because it is not found in the `_EMAIL_TO_RAW_MAPPING` dictionary.

Step 6: Since `raw_name` is `None`, the `download-url` header is added to the `unparsed` dictionary with the value `['VaLuE']`.

Step 7: The function then attempts to get the payload using `_get_payload(parsed, data)`. Since `data` is a string, it calls `msg.get_payload()` which returns an empty string.

Step 8: The payload is an empty string, so it is added to the `raw` dictionary with the key `description`.

Step 9: Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `raw` and `unparsed` dictionaries.
