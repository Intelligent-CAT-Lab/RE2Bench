I am simulating the execution of the `__eq__` function, with inputs `self` and `other`. 

At the beginning of the `__eq__` function, it checks if `self` is the same object as `other`. Since they are not, it moves to the next check.

The next check compares if the type of `self` is different from the type of `other`. `self` is an integer (implied from context) while `other` is a string expression. This means they are not of the same type. 

Because of this, the function attempts to convert `other` to a sympy object using the `_sympify` function. However, this is not relevant to the `__eq__` check itself since the actual `self` type (in this case, likely an integer) is being compared to the sympified version of `other`.

Given that `other` is a string representing a mathematical expression and `self` is an integer, they cannot be equal. Therefore, the equality check will return False.
