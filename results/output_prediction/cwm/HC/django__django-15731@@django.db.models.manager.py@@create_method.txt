The function `create_method` is a nested function inside `_get_queryset_methods`. It takes `name` and `method` as arguments. In this case, `name` is "values_list" and `method` is an empty dictionary.

The `create_method` function uses `wraps(method)` to preserve the metadata of the original method. Then, it defines a new function `manager_method` that, when called, will execute the original method on the queryset obtained from `self.get_queryset()`.

The `manager_method` is returned as the result of `create_method`. Since the original `method` is an empty dictionary, the `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned `manager_method` will reference this empty dictionary.
