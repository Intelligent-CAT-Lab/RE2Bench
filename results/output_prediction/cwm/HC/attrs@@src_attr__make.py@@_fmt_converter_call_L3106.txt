1. The function `_fmt_converter_call` is called with the parameters `attr_name="a"` and `value_var="a"`.
2. It checks if `takes_self` or `takes_field` are True. In this case, since the `self` object is a `Converter` instance with `takes_self=False` and `takes_field=False`, the condition `if not (self.takes_self or self.takes_field)` is True.
3. Therefore, it executes the line `return f'{self._get_global_name(attr_name)}({value_var})'`.
4. The function `_get_global_name(attr_name)` is called with `attr_name="a"`, which returns `__attr_converter_a`.
5. The final return value is `__attr_converter_a(a)`.
