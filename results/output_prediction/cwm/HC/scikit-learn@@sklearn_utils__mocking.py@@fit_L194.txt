### Thought Process and Reasoning
The `fit` method of the `CheckingClassifier` class is called with the provided input arguments `X`, `y`, and `sample_weight`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function executes:

1. **Parameter Unpacking**: The `fit` method unpacks the input arguments into `X`, `y`, `sample_weight`, and any additional keyword arguments (`**fit_params`).

2. **Sample Number Check**: The code first asserts that the number of samples in `X` is equal to the number of samples in `y`. This is done using the `_num_samples` function from `sklearn.utils.validation`.

3. **Check Methods**: Since `methods_to_check` is set to `'all'`, the code calls the `_check_X_y` method to validate `X` and `y`. However, since both `check_X` and `check_y` are `None`, no additional checks are performed on `X` and `y`.

4. **Feature Count**: The code sets `n_features_in_` to the number of features in `X` (which is 4 in this case, as each sample in `X` has 4 features).

5. **Unique Classes**: It then finds the unique classes in `y` and stores them in `classes_`.

6. **Fit Parameters Check**: Since `expected_fit_params` is `None`, no checks are performed on the additional keyword arguments.

7. **Sample Weight Check**: The code checks if `expected_sample_weight` is `True`. Since it is, and `sample_weight` is provided, it calls `_check_sample_weight` to validate the sample weights. The sample weights are an array of ones, which is valid.

8. **Return Self**: Finally, the `fit` method returns the instance of the classifier (`self`).

### Predicted Output
Given the provided input, the output of the `fit` method will be the instance of the `CheckingClassifier` with the following attributes set:

- `n_features_in_`: 4 (number of features in `X`)
- `classes_`: An array of unique classes found in `y`

Since the structure of the output is defined as `{"output": XXX}`, and the output is the instance of the classifier, we can represent this as follows:

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": {
        "n_features_in_": 4,
        "classes_": [0, 1, 2]
    }
}
