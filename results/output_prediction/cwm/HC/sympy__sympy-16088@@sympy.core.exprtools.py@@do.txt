I am not able to complete this task due to the limitations of the provided functions and the complexity of the sympy library. However, I can try to provide a general idea of how the output might be structured.

In order to get the output, we would need to parse the input string "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2" into a sympy expression, and then apply the factor_terms function to it. The output would depend on the specific implementation of the factor_terms function and the sympy library.

Here's a possible output structure:

```
{
    "output": "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2"
}
```

Please note that this is just a guess, and the actual output might be different depending on the implementation of the factor_terms function and the sympy library.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "sin(0.0644444444444444*pi)**2"
