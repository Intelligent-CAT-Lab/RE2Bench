The code being executed is for the ContinuousBase class's `_setup` method, which sets up a new scale object based on a provided dataset. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Copy the Scale Object**: The code starts by creating a copy of the current scale object using `new = copy(self)`. This is necessary to prevent modifications to the original object.

2. **Set Up Tick Parameters**: Since `new._tick_params` is initially `None`, the code calls `new = new.tick()` to set up the tick parameters. This will initialize the tick-related settings for the scale.

3. **Set Up Label Parameters**: Similarly, `new._label_params` is initially `None`, so `new = new.label()` is called to set up the label parameters. This initializes the label formatting settings.

4. **Get Transformation Functions**: The `forward` and `inverse` transformation functions are obtained using `new._get_transform()`. These functions are used to convert values to and from the scale's coordinate system.

5. **Create a Matplotlib Scale**: A new matplotlib scale object (`mpl_scale`) is created using the data name, forward, and inverse functions. This scale object handles the actual scaling and transformation of data values.

6. **Handle Missing Axis**: If an axis object is not provided, a `PseudoAxis` object is created using the `mpl_scale`. This axis object manages the units and settings for the scale.

7. **Set Default Locators and Formatters**: The `mpl_scale` has its default locators and formatters set based on the axis object. These determine how tick marks and labels are generated.

8. **Normalize Data (If Applicable)**: Since `prop.normed` is not specified, the normalization function is set to `None`. However, if normalization were required, it would involve calculating minimum and maximum values and scaling the data accordingly.

9. **Create Pipeline**: A pipeline is created that consists of functions for converting units, applying the forward transformation, normalizing (if applicable), and mapping values using the provided property. This pipeline defines the sequence of operations applied to data values.

10. **Define Spacer Function**: A spacer function is defined to calculate the minimum difference between unique, non-null values in a dataset. This is used for spacing purposes in the plot.

11. **Generate Legend (If Applicable)**: If legend generation is required, the axis's view interval is set, and major locators and formatters are used to generate labels for the legend. However, in this case, legend generation is not required.

12. **Return New Scale Object**: The newly configured scale object (`new`) is returned, which includes all the set-up parameters, transformations, and pipeline.
