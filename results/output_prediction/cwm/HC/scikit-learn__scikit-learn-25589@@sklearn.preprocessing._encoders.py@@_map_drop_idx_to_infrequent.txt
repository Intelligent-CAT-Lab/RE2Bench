Let's break this down step by step.

The method in question is `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` of the `OneHotEncoder` class. Its purpose is to map a drop index to the corresponding infrequent category index, if applicable.

Given the parameters:
- `feature_idx` is 1.
- `drop_idx` is "0" (though it's a string, but in the method, it's treated as an index).
- `self._infrequent_enabled` is False.

Looking at the code:

1. The method first checks if `self._infrequent_enabled` is False. Since it is, the method immediately returns `drop_idx` without any further processing.

Therefore, the output should be the value of `drop_idx`, which is "0".
