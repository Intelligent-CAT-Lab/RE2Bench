Let's go through the execution of the `prepare_url` method step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The `self` object has various attributes, but the most relevant ones are `method="POST"`, `url=None`, and `headers=None`. The `args` passed to `prepare_url` are `url="http://localhost:49515/"` and `params={}`.

2. **Line 32**: The `url` is already a string, so it is not decoded. Then, `url.lstrip()` is called, but since there are no leading spaces, the `url` remains `"http://localhost:49515/"`.

3. **Line 36**: The code checks if the `url` starts with a scheme (like "http"). Since it does, it proceeds to parse the URL.

4. **Line 39**: The `parse_url` function is called with the `url`, which returns the components: scheme, auth, host, port, path, query, and fragment. For `"http://localhost:49515/"`, this would parse into:
   - scheme: "http"
   - auth: None
   - host: "localhost"
   - port: 49515
   - path: "/"
   - query: None
   - fragment: None

5. **Line 44**: Since `scheme` is "http", it is valid, and the code proceeds.

6. **Line 46**: The `host` is "localhost", which is valid.

7. **Line 48**: The code checks if `host` is ASCII. Since "localhost" is ASCII, it proceeds.

8. **Line 54**: Since `host` does not start with "*" or ".", it proceeds.

9. **Line 56**: `netloc` is initialized as an empty string because `auth` is None.

10. **Line 58**: `netloc` becomes "localhost" after adding the `host`.

11. **Line 60**: The `port` is 49515, so `netloc` becomes "localhost:49515".

12. **Line 62**: The `path` is "/", so it remains the same.

13. **Line 64**: Since `params` is an empty dictionary, it is not a string or bytes, so it proceeds to encode the parameters.

14. **Line 66**: The `_encode_params` function is called with `params={}`. Since `params` is an empty dictionary, the function returns an empty string.

15. **Line 71**: Since `enc_params` is an empty string, the `query` remains None.

16. **Line 72**: The `urlunparse` function is called with the components: scheme="http", netloc="localhost:49515", path="/", query=None, fragment=None. This reconstructs the URL as "http://localhost:49515/".

17. **Line 73**: The `self.url` is set to "http://localhost:49515/".

The final output of the `prepare_url` method is the `self.url` attribute, which is now set to "http://localhost:49515/".
