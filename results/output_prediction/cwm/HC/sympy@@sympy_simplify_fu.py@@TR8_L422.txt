1. The function `TR8` is called with `rv="cos(phi)**2"` and `first=False`.
2. Inside `TR8`, since `first` is `False`, it proceeds to process the arguments of `rv` by classifying them into `cos`, `sin`, or `None` categories.
3. The input expression `cos(phi)**2` is a Power object with base `cos(phi)` and exponent `2`. Therefore, it is handled by the `elif` condition in the `for a in Mul.make_args(rv)` loop.
4. Since `a` is a Power object with exponent `2` and base `cos(phi)`, it extends the `cos` list with `phi` twice.
5. After processing, `args[cos]` becomes `[phi, phi]`, and `args[sin]` and `args[None]` are empty.
6. The code then checks if there are both `cos` and `sin` terms or if there are more than one `cos` or `sin` terms. In this case, there are two `cos` terms.
7. The code enters the loop `while len(c) > 1`, pops the last two `cos` terms (`phi` and `phi`), and appends `(cos(phi + phi) + cos(phi - phi)) / 2` to `args[None]`.
8. This results in `args[None]` containing `(cos(2*phi) + cos(0)) / 2`.
9. Since there are no more `cos` or `sin` terms left, the function returns `TR8(expand_mul(Mul(*args)))`, which simplifies the expression.
10. The final output is the simplified expression `(cos(2*phi) + 1) / 2`.
