The provided input is passed to the `__getitem__` method of a class that likely inherits from `MatrixExpr`. Let's analyze the execution step by step:

1. The method checks if `key` is a tuple. Since `key` is a list `[1, 2]`, this condition fails.
2. The method then checks if `key` is an instance of `SYMPY_INTS` or `Integer`. Since `key` is a list, this condition also fails.
3. The method checks if `key` is an instance of `Symbol` or `Expr`. Since `key` is a list, this condition fails as well.
4. Since none of the above conditions are met, the method raises an `IndexError` with the message "Invalid index, wanted <self>[i,j]".

Given that the input `key` is a list and not a tuple, integer, or symbolic expression, the method will raise an `IndexError`.
