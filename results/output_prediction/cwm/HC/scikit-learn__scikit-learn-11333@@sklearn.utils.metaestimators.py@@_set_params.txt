Step 1: We have to set the parameters for the ColumnTransformer instance. The method `_set_params` is called with `attr` as "_transformers" and the keyword argument "trans1__with_mean" set to false.

Step 2: First, we check if `attr` (which is "_transformers") is in the params dictionary. It is not, so we proceed to get the items (transformers) associated with the `attr` attribute.

Step 3: The items are obtained by calling the `_transformers` method, which returns a list of tuples containing the transformer names and their corresponding transformer objects.

Step 4: We then iterate over the keys in the params dictionary. The key "trans1__with_mean" is partitioned into "trans1", "__", and "with_mean". Since the key contains "__", it indicates that the parameter "with_mean" should be set for the transformer named "trans1".

Step 5: We update the nested_params dictionary with the key "trans1" and the value {"with_mean": false}.

Step 6: After processing all the keys in the params dictionary, we iterate over the nested_params dictionary and call the `set_params` method on the corresponding transformer object ("trans1") with the sub-parameters.

Step 7: Finally, we call the `set_params` method of the parent class (BaseEstimator) with the remaining parameters.

Step 8: The transformers attribute remains unchanged as it was not explicitly set in the params dictionary. The remainder attribute remains "drop", the n_jobs attribute remains 1, and the transformer_weights attribute remains null.
