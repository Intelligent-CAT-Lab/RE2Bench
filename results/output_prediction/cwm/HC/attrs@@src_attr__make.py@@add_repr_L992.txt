Let's go step by step through the execution of the `add_repr` method.

1. **Initialization**: The `add_repr` method is called on an instance of `_ClassBuilder` with `ns=None`. The method begins by calling `_make_repr_script(self._attrs, ns)`.

2. **`_make_repr_script` Execution**:
   - `attr_names_with_reprs`: This creates a tuple of attribute names, their repr functions (either `repr` or a custom one), and whether they're initialized. 
   - `globs`: A dictionary is created for global variables, including custom repr functions if any, `_compat`, `AttributeError`, and `NOTHING`.
   - `attribute_fragments`: For each attribute, a string fragment is created that represents how the attribute will be displayed in the `__repr__` string. For example, if an attribute `x` uses the default `repr`, it becomes `"x={self.x!r}"`.
   - `repr_fragment`: Joins all attribute fragments with commas.
   - `cls_name_fragment`: Since `ns` is `None`, it uses `{self.__class__.__qualname__.rsplit(">.", 1)[-1]}` to get the class name dynamically.
   - `lines`: Constructs the `__repr__` method as a string, handling recursion detection and formatting the attributes.

3. **Returning from `_make_repr_script`**: The function returns a tuple containing the constructed `__repr__` method as a string and the `globs` dictionary.

4. **Back in `add_repr`**:
   - The returned `script` and `globs` are stored in local variables.
   - A nested function `_attach_repr` is defined. This function will be used later to attach the generated `__repr__` method to the class dictionary.
   - `self._script_snippets.append((script, globs, _attach_repr))`: The script, globals, and the attach function are added to a list of script snippets. This list is likely used later in the class-building process to apply these scripts to the class.
   - `self._repr_added = True`: A flag is set indicating that a `__repr__` method has been added.

5. **Return Value**: The method returns `self`, allowing for method chaining.

The output of `add_repr` is the instance of `_ClassBuilder` itself, as it returns `self`. However, the main effect is that the `__repr__` method has been generated and scheduled for attachment to the class.
