Step 1: The `hpack` function is called with `w=0.0` and `m='additional'`. The function initializes variables `h`, `d`, `x`, `total_stretch`, and `total_shrink` to keep track of the height, depth, width, stretch, and shrink values.

Step 2: The function iterates over each child in `self.children`. 

Step 3: For the first child "Hlist<w=10.58 h=13.00 d=0.00 s=0.00>[\n  `0`,\n]", since it's an `Hlist`, `x` is increased by its width (10.58). The height `h` is updated to 13.00 (max of current `h` and the child's height). The depth `d` remains 0.00.

Step 4: For the second child "Hlist<w=8.08 h=9.10 d=0.00 s=-7.00>[\n  k0.17,\n  Hlist<w=7.40 h=9.10 d=0.00 s=0.00>[\n    `0`,\n    k1.54,\n  ],\n]", since it's also an `Hlist`, `x` is increased by its width (8.08). The height `h` is updated to 13.00 (max of current `h` and the child's height). The depth `d` remains 0.00.

Step 5: After iterating through all children, the function sets `self.height` to `h` (13.00) and `self.depth` to `d` (0.00).

Step 6: Since `m` is 'additional', `w` is increased by `x` (10.58 + 8.08 = 18.66). Then `self.width` is set to `w` (18.66).

Step 7: The remaining width `x` is calculated as `w - x` (18.66 - 18.66 = 0.0). Since `x` is 0.0, the function sets `self.glue_sign` to 0, `self.glue_order` to 0, and `self.glue_ratio` to 0.0, and returns.
