<think>
The function `_mapping_repr` is called with the arguments `mapping={"foo": "bar"}`, `title="Attributes"`, `summarizer={}`, `expand_option_name="display_expand_attrs"`, and the default values for `col_width` and `max_rows`. 

1. The function checks if `col_width` is `None`, so it calls `_calculate_col_width(mapping)`. The `mapping` has a key "foo" which has a length of 3. Therefore, `col_width` becomes `max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`.

2. It then checks if `max_rows` is `None`, so it sets `max_rows` to the value of `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. Assuming this value is not provided, it might be a default value, but for this case, let's assume it's a large number so that all items are displayed.

3. The summary list is initialized with the title "Attributes:".

4. Since the `mapping` is not empty, it calculates `len_mapping` as 1. 

5. The function checks if `expand_option_name` is set to `False` or a boolean value. Since it's a string "display_expand_attrs", it calls `_get_boolean_with_default` with this option and a default value of `True`. Assuming this option is set to `True`, it proceeds to display all items.

6. Since `len_mapping` (1) is not greater than `max_rows`, it adds the summarized items to the summary list. It calls the `summarizer` function for each item in the `mapping`. However, the provided `summarizer` is an empty dictionary, which is not a callable function. This would typically raise an error, but since we're simulating the execution, let's assume that the `summarizer` function is correctly defined elsewhere and it returns a string representation of the key-value pair.

7. Finally, the function joins the summary list into a single string with newline characters and returns it.
