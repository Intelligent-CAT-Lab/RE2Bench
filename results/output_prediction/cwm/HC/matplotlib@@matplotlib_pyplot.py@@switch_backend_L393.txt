The function `switch_backend` is called with the argument `newbackend` set to "Agg". Let's walk through the execution step by step:

1. **Check if `newbackend` is an auto sentinel**: The function first checks if `newbackend` is an auto sentinel. Since it is not, the code proceeds to the next step.

2. **Get the current backend**: The current backend is retrieved using `rcParams._get('backend')`. This will be the old backend.

3. **Load the backend module**: The backend module for "Agg" is loaded using `backend_registry.load_backend_module(newbackend)`. This module will contain the classes and functions specific to the "Agg" backend.

4. **Get the canvas class and required framework**: The `FigureCanvas` class is retrieved from the loaded module, and the required interactive framework for this backend is checked. Since "Agg" is a non-interactive backend, the required framework is `None`.

5. **Get the figure manager and show functions**: The `new_figure_manager` and `show` functions are retrieved from the module. If `new_figure_manager` is `None`, default implementations are defined.

6. **Create a backend module**: A new backend module class `backend_mod` is created, which inherits from `matplotlib.backend_bases._Backend`. This class updates its locals with the variables from the loaded module.

7. **Update the backend module**: Depending on the presence of `new_figure_manager` and `show`, the `backend_mod` is updated with the appropriate functions.

8. **Log the loaded backend**: A debug log is generated indicating that the "Agg" backend has been loaded.

9. **Update rcParams and globals**: The `rcParams` and `rcParamsDefault` are updated to set the backend to "Agg". The globals dictionary is also updated with the new functions from `backend_mod`.

10. **Install the REPL display hook**: Finally, the `install_repl_displayhook` function is called to connect to the display hook of the current shell.

Since the function does not return any value explicitly, the output will be `None`.
