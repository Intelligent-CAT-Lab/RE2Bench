Let's analyze the provided code and input to predict the output of the `transform` method.

First, the `transform` method calls `_transform_selected`, which in turn calls the `_transform` method of the `OneHotEncoder` class. The `_transform` method is responsible for transforming the input data `X` into a one-hot encoded format.

The input `X` is `[[1 1 1]]`, which means we have one sample with three features, all having the value 1.

Now, let's look at the attributes of the `OneHotEncoder` instance:
- `n_values_` is `[4 3 2]`, indicating that the first feature can take 4 possible values, the second feature can take 3 possible values, and the third feature can take 2 possible values.
- `feature_indices_` is `[0 4 7 9]`, which represents the starting indices for each feature in the one-hot encoded matrix.
- `active_features_` is `[0 3 5 6 8]`, indicating which features are active (non-zero) in the one-hot encoded matrix.

In the `_transform` method, the code checks if the input `X` has the same shape as during fitting. Since `X` has 3 features and `feature_indices_` has 4 elements (including the starting index 0), this check passes.

Then, it calculates `column_indices` by adding the feature values in `X` to the corresponding starting indices in `feature_indices_`. For the input `[[1 1 1]]`, this results in `column_indices` being `[1, 5, 8]`.

The `row_indices` are calculated as `[0, 0, 0]` since there is only one sample.

The `data` array is filled with ones, resulting in `[1, 1, 1]`.

Finally, a sparse COO matrix is created with the `data`, `row_indices`, and `column_indices`, and then converted to a CSR matrix. Since `sparse` is `True`, the output is a sparse matrix.

The shape of the output matrix is `(1, 9)` because there are 9 active features (as indicated by `active_features_`).

The `indices` and `indptr` arrays are determined by the structure of the sparse matrix, and the `data` array contains the non-zero values, which are all ones in this case.
