Step 1: The function `format_pct` is called with `x=120` and `display_range=100`.
Step 2: `x` is converted to a percentage using `convert_to_pct`, which returns `120.0` since `x=120` and `xmax=100.0`.
Step 3: Since `self.decimals` is set to `0`, the code proceeds to use that value directly for formatting.
Step 4: The value `x` is formatted to a string with 0 decimal places, resulting in the string `'120'`.
Step 5: The formatted string is concatenated with `self.symbol`, which is `'%'`, resulting in the final output `'120%'`.
