Let's walk through the execution of `_eval_is_extended_positive_negative` step by step with the given input.

1. **Function Entry and Variables**:
   - The function is called with `self = -2` and `positive = True`.

2. **Check if `self` is a Number**:
   - The first line checks `if self.is_number`. Since `-2` is a number, this condition is true.

3. **Evaluate `self._eval_evalf(2)`**:
   - The function calls `self._eval_evalf(2)` to evaluate `-2` to 2 decimal places. The result is a Float object representing `-2.0`.

4. **Check Precision**:
   - It checks if the precision of `n2` (the evaluated value) is 1. Since the precision here is 2 (as we evaluated to 2 decimal places), this condition is false.

5. **Handle `n2` Being `S.NaN`**:
   - The next check is if `n2` is `S.NaN` (Not a Number). Since `-2.0` is a valid number, this condition is false.

6. **Evaluate `self.evalf(2)`**:
   - The function evaluates `self.evalf(2)` to get a more precise value. This also results in `-2.0`.

7. **Check if the Result is a Float**:
   - Since the result is a Float, it sets `match = (f, S.Zero)`, where `f` is `-2.0` and `S.Zero` is `0`.

8. **Extract Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   - It extracts `r` and `i` from `match`, which are `-2.0` and `0`, respectively.

9. **Check if Both Parts Are Numbers**:
   - Both `r` and `i` are numbers, so this condition is true.

10. **Check Precision of Real and Imaginary Parts**:
    - The precision of `r` is 2 (not 1), and the precision of `i` is 1. Since `i` has precision 1 and is zero, the function proceeds to check if `self` is algebraic and does not contain any functions.

11. **Algebraic Check**:
    - The function checks if `self` is algebraic using `_eval_is_algebraic()`. Since `-2` is a rational number, it is algebraic.

12. **Minimal Polynomial Check**:
    - It attempts to compute the minimal polynomial of `self` using `minimal_polynomial(self)`. For `-2`, the minimal polynomial is `x + 2`, which is not a Symbol. Therefore, the condition `minimal_polynomial(self).is_Symbol` is false.

13. **Return Value**:
    - Since the minimal polynomial is not a Symbol, the function returns `False`.
