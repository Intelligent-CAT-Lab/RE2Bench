The function `_convert_other` is called with the following arguments:
- `column` represents a column with format 'K' (which likely stands for 64-bit integer), no unit, no null value, no BSCALE or BZERO, and no dimensions.
- `field` is a NumPy array `[2, 4]`, which seems to be the raw data for the column.
- `recformat` is 'i8', indicating that the data should be interpreted as 64-bit integers.

Inside `_convert_other`, several checks and conversions are performed. 

1. Since `recformat` is not an instance of `_FormatX`, the function proceeds to determine scale factors and other properties of the column.
2. The column's format is checked, and since it's 'K', it's considered a numeric type.
3. The function checks if the column has scale or zero-point values (BSCALE and BZERO). In this case, both are None, so no scaling is applied.
4. Since the column is numeric and has no scale or zero-point, the function checks if the data needs to be reshaped based on dimensions. The column has no dimensions, so no reshaping is done.
5. The function then checks if the column is of type boolean or string. Since it's numeric, these checks are skipped.
6. Finally, the function returns the `field` as is, since no conversions or scaling are needed.

Therefore, the output of the function `_convert_other` will be the input `field` array `[2, 4]`.
