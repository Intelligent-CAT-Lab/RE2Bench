In this task, the function `_common_new` is called with the arguments `cls=Integral`, `function=1`, `discrete=False`, and `symbols=['x']`. 

First, `function = sympify(function)` is called, which converts the integer `1` into a SymPy integer. Since `function` is not an instance of `Equality` or `S.NaN`, the function continues.

Next, it checks if `symbols` is non-empty. Since `symbols` is `['x']`, it is non-empty. The function then calls `_process_limits(*symbols, discrete=discrete)`. The `_process_limits` function processes the list of symbols and converts them into canonical limits. 

In this case, `symbols` is `['x']`, and `discrete` is `False`. The `_process_limits` function will return `limits = [(x,)]` and `orientation = 1`.

After that, the function checks if `cls` is the same as `type(function)`. Since `cls` is `Integral` and `type(function)` is `Integer`, this condition is not met.

The function then initializes an empty dictionary `reps` and a set `symbols_of_integration` containing the first element of each limit, which is `x`.

It then checks if `function` has any `Piecewise` atoms. Since `function` is `1`, which is an integer and does not contain any `Piecewise` atoms, this loop does not execute.

The function then calls `function = function.xreplace(reps)`, which replaces any keys in `reps` with their corresponding values in `function`. Since `reps` is empty, `function` remains `1`.

Next, it calls `function = piecewise_fold(function)`, which folds any `Piecewise` expressions in `function`. Since `function` is `1`, which is not a `Piecewise` expression, `function` remains `1`.

The function then calls `function = function.xreplace({v: k for k, v in reps.items()})`, which again replaces any keys in `reps` with their corresponding values in `function`. Since `reps` is empty, `function` remains `1`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `function`, `limits`, and `orientation`. 

Therefore, the output of the function will be `(1, [(x,)], 1)`.
