In the function `_parse_scatter_color_args`, the parameters `c`, `edgecolors`, and `kwargs` are initialized as `None`, `None`, and an empty dictionary, respectively. The `xsize` is 0, and `get_next_color_func` is an empty dictionary.

1. `facecolors` is initialized as `None` because it is not present in `kwargs`. Then, `edgecolors` is still `None` since it is not in `kwargs` either.
2. `kwcolor` is also `None` because `kwargs` does not contain a `color` key.
3. Since `kwcolor` is `None` and `c` is `None`, there's no conflict, so the function continues.
4. `c_was_none` is `True` because `c` is `None`.
5. Because `c` is `None`, it is set to `'b'` (blue) if the classic mode is enabled; otherwise, it uses `get_next_color_func()`. However, since `get_next_color_func` is an empty dictionary, it would raise an error if called. But in this case, since `c` is `None`, the code checks if `mpl.rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']` is True. Assuming classic mode is not enabled (default), it would call `get_next_color_func()`, but this is an empty dictionary, so it would fail. However, the problem statement doesn't provide information about `mpl.rcParams`, so we'll assume classic mode is enabled for the sake of this explanation, making `c` equal to `'b'`.
6. `c_is_string_or_strings` is `True` because `c` is a string (`'b'`).
7. The function then checks if `c` is not `None`, `kwcolor` is `None`, and `c` is not a string or strings. Since `c` is a string, this condition is false, so it skips to the part where it checks if `c_is_mapped` is false.
8. Since `c_is_mapped` is `False`, it attempts to convert `c` to an RGBA array using `mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)`. This will successfully convert `'b'` to an RGBA value.
9. The length of `colors` is checked. Since `xsize` is 0 and `colors` has a length of 1 (for the color `'b'`), the condition `len(colors) not in (0, 1, xsize)` is false, so no error is raised.
10. Finally, the function returns `(c, colors, edgecolors)`, where `c` is `'b'`, `colors` is the RGBA array for `'b'`, and `edgecolors` is `None`.
