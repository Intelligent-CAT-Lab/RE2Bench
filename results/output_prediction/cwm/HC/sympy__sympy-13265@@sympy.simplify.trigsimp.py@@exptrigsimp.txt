We need to determine the output of the `exptrigsimp` function when called with the expression `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`.

Let's break down the steps involved in this function:

1. **Initial Simplification**: The function starts by applying a `bottom_up` transformation to the input expression using the `exp_trig` function. This transformation checks if the expression contains any trigonometric functions and rewrites them in terms of exponential functions if possible.

2. **Exponential Form**: The expression `sinh(x) + cosh(x)` is known to simplify to `exp(x)`. The `exp_trig` function should recognize this and rewrite the expression accordingly.

3. **Further Simplification**: After rewriting, the function applies another `bottom_up` transformation using the function `f`. This step seems to handle further simplifications, potentially involving powers of exponential functions.

4. **Hyperbolic to Trigonometric Conversion**: If the resulting expression still contains hyperbolic functions, it is converted back to trigonometric functions using `hyper_as_trig`. However, in this case, since we've already simplified to an exponential form, this step might not be necessary.

5. **Trigonometric Simplification**: If there are any remaining trigonometric functions, they are simplified using `TR2i`.

6. **Imaginary Unit Handling**: The function checks if the simplified expression introduces an imaginary unit (`I`) that wasn't present in the original expression. If so, it might revert some changes.

Given the input `sinh(x) + cosh(x)`, the expected simplification is `exp(x)`.

Now, let's consider the structure of the output. The function `exptrigsimp` returns a SymPy expression. When this expression is converted to a dictionary (as per the structure provided), it should have a key `"nargs"` with a value that represents the arguments of the expression in a specific format.

For the expression `exp(x)`, the arguments are `[x]`. Therefore, the output should reflect this structure.
