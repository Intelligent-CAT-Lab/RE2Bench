The function `subplots` is being called on a `GridSpecBase` object. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization and Checks**: The function starts by checking if the `GridSpecBase` object has an associated figure. In this case, `self.figure` is a `<Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes>`, so the figure exists, and the code proceeds.

2. **Setting Share Parameters**: The `sharex` and `sharey` parameters are set to 'none' because the input values are `False`. These parameters control how axes share their x and y scales.

3. **Creating Axes Array**: An empty array `axarr` of shape `(1, 1)` is created to hold the axes objects. This corresponds to the single row and column defined in the `GridSpecBase` object.

4. **Looping Through Rows and Columns**: The function iterates through each row and column (in this case, only one of each). For each position, it determines the `sharex` and `sharey` settings for the new axes based on the `sharex` and `sharey` parameters.

5. **Adding Subplots**: For the single cell (row 0, column 0), the function calls `figure.add_subplot` with the subplot specification derived from `self[0, 0]`. This adds a new axes object to the figure and places it in the specified position.

6. **Labeling Outer Axes**: Since `sharex` and `sharey` are 'none', there's no need to adjust the labeling of outer axes.

7. **Squeezing the Result**: The `squeeze` parameter is `True`, so the function returns the single axes object directly instead of returning an array containing the axes object.

The final output is the axes object created by `figure.add_subplot` at position `(0, 0)`.
