Step 1: 
Let's analyze the given function `axis_aligned_extrema` and its input.

The function `axis_aligned_extrema` is a method of the `BezierSegment` class. It is designed to compute the axis-aligned extrema of a Bézier curve. 

Step 2: 
The input provided is a JSON object representing the state of a `BezierSegment` object. Specifically, it includes:
- `_cpoints`: The control points of the Bézier curve, which is a 1D array `[[0., -2.48451997]]`.
- `_N`: The number of control points, which is 1.
- `_d`: The dimension of the control points, which is 2 (indicating 2D coordinates).
- `_orders`: An array representing the order of the control points, which is `[0]`.
- `_px`: The control points multiplied by certain coefficients, which in this case is the same as `_cpoints`.

Step 3: 
Now, let's look at the `axis_aligned_extrema` method. It starts by determining the degree `n` of the Bézier curve, which is calculated as `self._N - 1`. Since `_N` is 1, the degree `n` will be 0.

Step 4: 
The method then checks if the degree `n` is less than or equal to 1. If this condition is true, it returns a tuple of two empty arrays. This is because a Bézier curve of degree 0 or 1 does not have any extrema other than its endpoints.

Step 5: 
Given that the degree `n` is 0 (which is less than or equal to 1), the function will return `(np.array([]), np.array([]))`.

Therefore, the output of `axis_aligned_extrema` will be a tuple containing two empty arrays.
