The `to` method is called on an instance of `FunctionUnitBase`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The method checks if `other` is equal to `self.physical_unit`. Since both `other` and `self.physical_unit` have the same `_hash` (2181990727224913881) and other attributes seem identical, this condition is `True`.

2. When the condition `other is self.physical_unit` is met, the method calls `self.to_physical(value)`. The `value` passed is "2.5". However, we need to determine the behavior of `to_physical` based on the provided data.

3. Given the structure of the input, `self._function_unit` has a `_scale` of -2.0. This suggests that `to_physical` might apply this scale to the input value. If `to_physical` multiplies the value by `_scale`, then `2.5 * -2.0 = -5.0`.

4. Therefore, the output of `self.to_physical(value)` would be `-5.0`.

5. Since the condition `other is self.physical_unit` is `True`, the method returns `-5.0` directly without further processing.
