Step 1: The function `is_valid_backend` is called with the argument `backend='Agg'`.

Step 2: Since the `backend` does not start with 'module://', it is converted to lowercase, resulting in `backend='agg'`.

Step 3: The code checks if `backend` is in the `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` dictionary or in the `_backend_to_gui_framework` dictionary. It is found in `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` with the value 'headless'.

Step 4: Therefore, the function returns `True` immediately, as the backend is valid.
