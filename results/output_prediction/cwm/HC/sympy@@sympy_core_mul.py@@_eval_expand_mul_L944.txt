In the `_eval_expand_mul` method, the expression is initially `-sin(phi)**2`. 

First, it calls `fraction(expr, hints.get('exact', False))` to separate the expression into numerator and denominator. Since the expression is not a fraction, it returns `(-sin(phi)**2, 1)`.

Then it checks if the denominator is a multiplication. In this case, it is not, so it proceeds with the numerator.

It initializes `plain`, `sums`, and `rewrite` variables. `rewrite` is a flag to check if any factor is an addition. Since `-sin(phi)**2` is not an addition, `rewrite` remains `False`.

Since `rewrite` is `False`, it returns the original expression, which is `-sin(phi)**2`.
