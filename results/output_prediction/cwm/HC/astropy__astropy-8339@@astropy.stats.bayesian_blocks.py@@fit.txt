The provided code snippet defines a `FitnessFunc` class with a `fit` method that processes time series data `t`, observations `x`, and error estimates `sigma` to identify change points in the data using a fitness function. The inputs are passed to the `fit` method, which performs several steps:

1. **Input Validation**: The inputs `t`, `x`, and `sigma` are validated and normalized.
2. **Fitness Argument Preparation**: Depending on the fitness function's required arguments (`a_k`, `b_k`, `c_k`, `T_k`, `N_k`), corresponding values are computed from the input data.
3. **Edge Calculation**: Edges are calculated based on the time series `t`.
4. **Block Length Calculation**: The length of each block is determined using the edges.
5. **Initialization**: Arrays `best` and `last` are initialized to track the best fitness values and the last change point indices, respectively.
6. **Fitness Calculation Loop**: For each possible number of change points `R`, the fitness function is evaluated, and the best fitness value and corresponding change point index are updated.
7. **Change Point Extraction**: The change points are extracted from the `last` array, starting from the last index and tracing back using the stored indices.
8. **Return Change Points**: The edges at the identified change points are returned as the output.

Given the input values, the `fit` method will process the time series data, compute the necessary values for the fitness function, and identify the change points. The output will be the edges at these change points.

The input values are:
- `t`: An array of time values.
- `x`: An array of observations.
- `sigma`: The error estimate (0.1 in this case).

The `ncp_prior` is provided as 4.129998814104668, and `p0` is 0.05.

The output will be an array of change points identified in the time series data based on the fitness function's evaluation.
