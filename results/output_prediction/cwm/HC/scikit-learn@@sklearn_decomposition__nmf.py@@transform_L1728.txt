The transform function is called with X as input. First, it checks if the estimator is fitted using check_is_fitted. Since the estimator has attributes ending with an underscore (like n_features_in_, n_components_, etc.), it is considered fitted.

Next, the input data X is validated using validate_data. This function checks the input data for consistency and ensures it meets the requirements of the estimator. It also sets or checks feature names and counts.

After validation, the function calls _fit_transform with update_H=False. This method learns a NMF model for the data X and returns the transformed data. Since update_H is False, only W (the transformed data) is estimated, and H (the factorization matrix) is not updated.

The _fit_transform method checks parameters, initializes or checks W and H, scales regularization terms, and then fits the model using the coordinate descent solver ('cd'). It returns the transformed data W, the factorization matrix H, and the number of iterations.

Finally, the transform function returns the transformed data W.
