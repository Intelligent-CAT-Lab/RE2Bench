Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a `Term` class with a `mul` method, and we need to find the output of calling `mul` on two `Term` instances. Both instances have a coefficient of 1, an empty numerator `Factors({})`, and an empty denominator `Factors({})`.

First, let's understand what the `mul` method does. It multiplies two `Term` instances by multiplying their coefficients, numerators, and denominators, and then normalizing the result.

1. `coeff = self.coeff * other.coeff`: Since both coefficients are 1, the result is 1 * 1 = 1.
2. `numer = self.numer.mul(other.numer)`: Both numerators are empty `Factors({})`, so multiplying them results in an empty `Factors({})`.
3. `denom = self.denom.mul(other.denom)`: Both denominators are empty `Factors({})`, so multiplying them results in an empty `Factors({})`.
4. `numer, denom = numer.normal(denom)`: Since both numer and denom are empty, normalization doesn't change them.

Therefore, the resulting `Term` instance will have a coefficient of 1, an empty numerator, and an empty denominator.

Now, let's predict the output structure. The output should be a `Term` instance represented as a string, which in this case would be "Term(1, Factors({}), Factors({}))".
