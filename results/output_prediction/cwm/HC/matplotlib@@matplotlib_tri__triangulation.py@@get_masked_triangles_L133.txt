We are given an instance of the `Triangulation` class with certain attributes. The method `get_masked_triangles` is called. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The method `get_masked_triangles` is entered.
2. It checks if `self.mask` is not `None`.
3. Since `self.mask` is `None`, it returns `self.triangles`.

The output of `get_masked_triangles` will be the value of `self.triangles`, which is a 2D array of triangles.
