The `fit` method is called on the StandardScaler object, which first calls the `_reset` method to remove any existing attributes like `scale_`, `n_samples_seen_`, `mean_`, and `var_`. Then it proceeds to `partial_fit`.

Inside `partial_fit`, the data `X` is validated and processed. Since `X` is a dense array (not sparse), and `sample_weight` is `None`, the code checks if it's the first call (which it is, since `n_samples_seen_` doesn't exist yet). It initializes `n_samples_seen_` as an array of zeros with the same number of features as `X`.

Since `with_mean` and `with_std` are both `True`, the code calculates the mean, variance, and number of samples seen using `_incremental_mean_and_var`. The mean is initialized to 0.0, and the variance is also initialized to 0.0. The function `_incremental_mean_and_var` will update these values based on the input data.

The input data `X` is `[[1, nan], [0, 0]]`. The first feature has values 1 and 0, and the second feature has a NaN and 0. The mean for the first feature will be (1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5, and the variance will be ((1 - 0.5)^2 + (0 - 0.5)^2) / 2 = (0.25 + 0.25) / 2 = 0.25. For the second feature, since there is a NaN, it will be ignored in the mean and variance calculations. The mean will be 0 (since only 0 is considered), and the variance will be 0.

After calculating the mean and variance, the code checks if all features have the same number of samples seen. Since both features have 2 samples (excluding the NaN), `n_samples_seen_` remains as an array [2, 2].

The code then calculates the scale as the square root of the variance. For the first feature, the scale is sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. For the second feature, the scale is sqrt(0) = 0. However, since the variance is zero (constant feature), the scale is set to 1.0 to avoid division by zero in the transformation step.

Finally, the `fit` method returns the StandardScaler object itself.
