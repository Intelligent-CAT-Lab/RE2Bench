1. The function `as_string` is called on the `MigrationWriter` instance with the provided input.
2. Inside `as_string`, we initialize variables:
   - `items` dictionary with default values for 'replaces_str' and 'initial_str'.
   - An empty set `imports` to keep track of import statements.
   - An empty list `operations` to store operation strings.
3. Since `self.migration.operations` is `null`, the loop over operations does not execute, leaving `operations` empty.
4. `items['operations']` is set to an empty string because `operations` is empty.
5. Similarly, since `self.migration.dependencies` is also `null`, the loop over dependencies does not execute, leaving `dependencies` empty.
6. `items['dependencies']` is set to an empty string.
7. The code checks for specific import patterns and modifies the `imports` set accordingly, but since `imports` is empty, this part has no effect.
8. The code ensures that `from django.db import migrations` is added to `imports`.
9. The `sorted_imports` are generated, which in this case is just `['from django.db import migrations']`.
10. `items['imports']` is set to the sorted imports joined by newlines.
11. Since `self.migration.replaces` and `self.migration.initial` are both `null`, the corresponding strings in `items` remain empty.
12. `self.include_header` is `false`, so `items['migration_header']` is set to an empty string.
13. Finally, the `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` is formatted with the `items` dictionary to generate the output string.

The output string will be a migration file template with empty operations, dependencies, and imports (except for the mandatory `from django.db import migrations`), and no header since `include_header` is `false`.
