I need to predict the output of the `get_family` method given the provided input. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input structure, the `self` object has a `_family` attribute, which is a list containing the string "Helvetica". The `get_family` method is supposed to return this value.

The `get_family` method is defined as:
```python
def get_family(self):
    return self._family
```
This method simply returns the `_family` attribute of the instance.

Given that the `_family` attribute in the input is `["Helvetica"]`, the `get_family` method should return this list.

Therefore, the output should be a JSON object with the key "output" and the value `["Helvetica"]`.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": [
        "Helvetica"
    ]
}
[/OUTPUT]
