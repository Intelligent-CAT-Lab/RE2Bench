Let's break down the step-by-step execution of the function `format_data` with the given input.

1. The function `format_data` is called with the value `0.11`.
2. The first step calculates `e = math.floor(math.log10(abs(0.11)))`. The absolute value of `0.11` is `0.11`. The base-10 logarithm of `0.11` is approximately `-0.959`. Taking the floor of this value results in `e = -1`.
3. Next, the significand is calculated as `s = round(0.11 / 10^(-1), 10)`. Since `10^(-1)` is `0.1`, dividing `0.11` by `0.1` gives `1.1`. Rounding this to 10 decimal places keeps it as `1.1`.
4. The significand is then formatted using the `_format_maybe_minus_and_locale` method with the format `'%1.10g'` (since `s % 1 != 0`). Given that `_useLocale` and `_useMathText` are both `False`, the method simply returns `fmt % arg`, which in this case is `'1.1'`.
5. Since `e` is `-1` (not equal to 0), the code proceeds to format the exponent. The exponent is formatted using `_format_maybe_minus_and_locale` with `'%d'`, resulting in the string `'-1'`.
6. Because `_useMathText` and `_usetex` are both `False`, the code uses the else branch and returns the string `'1.1e-1'`.

Therefore, the output of the function is `'1.1e-1'`.
