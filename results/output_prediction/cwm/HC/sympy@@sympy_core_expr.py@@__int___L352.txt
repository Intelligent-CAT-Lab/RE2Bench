Let's break down the step-by-step execution of the `__int__` method given the input `"1 + I"`.

1. **Initial checks**: 
   - The input is a complex number expressed as `"1 + I"` (1 plus the imaginary unit i).
   - The `__int__` method first checks if the object is a number using `self.is_number`. For `"1 + I"`, this returns `True` because it's a complex number.
   - It then checks if the number is comparable using `self.is_comparable`. This is also `True` because complex numbers can be evaluated to a real number (or already is a real number) with precision.

2. **Rounding the number**:
   - The method rounds the complex number to 2 decimal places using `self.round(2)`. This results in the number `1 + 0*I` (since the imaginary part is 0 after rounding).
   - It checks if the rounded result is a number (`r.is_Number`), which it is, and if it's one of the special values like NaN or Infinity, which it isn't.

3. **Converting to integer**:
   - The method attempts to convert the rounded complex number to an integer using `int(r)`. However, since the number is still complex (`1 + 0*I`), this conversion raises a `TypeError` because Python's `int()` function cannot directly convert a complex number to an integer.
   - The error is caught, and the method returns the integer part of the real component, which is `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `__int__` method for the input `"1 + I"` is `1`.
