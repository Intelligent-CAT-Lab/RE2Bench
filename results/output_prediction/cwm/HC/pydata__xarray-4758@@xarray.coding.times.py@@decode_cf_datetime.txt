1. The function `decode_cf_datetime` is called with `num_dates=null`, `units="days since 0001-01-01"`, and `calendar="366_day"`.
2. Inside the function, `num_dates` is converted to a numpy array using `np.asarray(num_dates)`. Since `num_dates` is null, it will be an array with a null or undefined value.
3. The variable `flat_num_dates` is created by ravelling `num_dates`, which doesn't change the array since it's already one-dimensional.
4. The `calendar` parameter is set to "366_day", which is not in the `_STANDARD_CALENDARS` set. Therefore, the code will raise an exception when trying to decode the datetime with pandas.
5. The function `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` is called, but it raises a `OutOfBoundsDatetime` exception because the calendar is non-standard.
6. The exception is caught, and the function `_decode_datetime_with_cftime` is called instead.
7. Inside `_decode_datetime_with_cftime`, the `cftime.num2date` function is used to convert the num_dates to cftime datetime objects. Since `num_dates` is null, the resulting array will contain null or undefined values.
8. The function returns the reshaped array of cftime datetime objects.
