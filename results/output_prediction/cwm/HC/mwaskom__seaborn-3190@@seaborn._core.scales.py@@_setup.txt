Let's walk through the execution of the `_setup` method step by step.

1. **Initialization and Copy**: The method starts by creating a copy of the current object (`new = copy(self)`). This ensures that any modifications made during the method's execution do not affect the original object.

2. **Tick and Label Parameters**: 
   - Since `new._tick_params` is `None`, the `tick()` method is called. Although the implementation of `tick()` is not provided, we can infer that it initializes the tick parameters for the scale.
   - Similarly, since `new._label_params` is `None`, the `label()` method is called. Again, without the implementation, we assume it sets up the label formatting for the scale.

3. **Transformation Functions**:
   - The method retrieves the forward and inverse transformation functions using `new._get_transform()`. Given that `self.trans` is "log", it's likely that these functions apply logarithmic transformations.
   - A matplotlib scale object (`mpl_scale`) is created with the name "x" (from `data.name`) and the transformation functions.

4. **Axis and Scale Setup**:
   - A `PseudoAxis` object is created with the `mpl_scale` and updated with the units from the `data` object.
   - The default locators and formatters for the axis are set using `mpl_scale.set_default_locators_and_formatters(axis)`.

5. **Normalization**:
   - Since `prop.normed` is not explicitly mentioned but likely `False` (as there's no mention of normalization in the provided inputs), the normalization function is set to `None`.

6. **Pipeline Construction**:
   - The pipeline is constructed as a list of functions: `[axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`. This pipeline will be used to transform data points through various stages.

7. **Spacer Function**:
   - A `spacer` function is defined to calculate the minimum difference between unique, non-NA values in a dataset. This is used to determine the spacing between ticks.

8. **Legend Preparation**:
   - If `prop.legend` is `True`, the method prepares the legend by setting the view interval, formatting tick locations, and creating labels. However, since `prop.legend` is not provided, we assume it's `False` or not relevant here.

9. **Return Value**:
   - The method returns the modified `new` object, which now contains the setup scale, axis, and other parameters.

Given the input and the steps above, the output should reflect the initialized scale with default tick and label parameters, a logarithmic transformation, and a pipeline for data transformation.
