Step 1: Analyze the provided function and input parameters. The function `_print_set` is being called with an input of `s = ["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`.

Step 2: Understand the role of the function `_print_set`. It appears to be responsible for generating a pretty-printed representation of a set in SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

Step 3: Check if the set `s` is empty. In this case, it is not, so we proceed to sort the elements of the set using the `default_sort_key` function.

Step 4: Apply the `default_sort_key` function to each element in the set `s`. This function returns a key that can be used for sorting based on the class and attributes of the elements.

Step 5: Sort the elements of the set using the keys obtained from the `default_sort_key` function. The sorted elements are then passed to the `_print_seq` function to generate a pretty-printed sequence.

Step 6: The `_print_seq` function generates a string representation of the sequence, enclosed in parentheses.

Step 7: Finally, the generated string representation is enclosed in curly braces `{}` to represent a set.

Step 8: Based on the input `s = ["Q.integer", "Q.positive"]`, the output of the `_print_set` function will be a pretty-printed representation of the set containing these two elements.
