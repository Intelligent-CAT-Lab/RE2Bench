I will execute the function _get_params with the provided input.

1. The function starts by calling `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`. Since `deep=False`, this will return a dictionary of the parameters of the current object, but not recursively.

2. Next, it retrieves the value of `estimators` by calling `getattr(self, attr)`, where `attr` is "_transformers". This calls the `_transformers` method, which returns a list of tuples containing the names and transformers. However, since `self.transformers` is `null`, this will return an empty list.

3. The function then updates the `out` dictionary with the `estimators`. Since `estimators` is an empty list, this does not change the `out` dictionary.

4. The function then iterates over the `estimators` and updates the `out` dictionary with the parameters of each estimator. However, since `estimators` is an empty list, this loop does not execute.

5. Finally, the function returns the `out` dictionary.
