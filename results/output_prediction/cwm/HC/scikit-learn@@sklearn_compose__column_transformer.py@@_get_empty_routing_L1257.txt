Okay, I need to figure out the output of `_get_empty_routing` based on the given input. Let me walk through the code step by step.

The method `_get_empty_routing` returns a `Bunch` object created from a dictionary comprehension. This dictionary comprehension iterates over the items generated by the `_iter` method, but only for transformers that are not 'drop' and not empty columns. Each item in the dictionary has a key equal to the transformer name (like "trans") and a value that is another `Bunch` object containing keys for each method in `METHODS` (like 'fit', 'transform', etc.), each mapped to an empty dictionary.

Let's look at the input `self` object. The `transformers` list contains a single entry: ["trans", "Trans()", <lambda>]. The `_columns` list has [0], and the `_transformer_to_input_indices` maps "trans" to [0]. The `_remainder` is ["remainder", "drop", [1]].

When `_iter` is called with `fitted=False`, `column_as_labels=False`, `skip_drop=True`, and `skip_empty_columns=True`, it checks each transformer. Since `skip_drop` is True, it skips any transformer named 'drop'. The transformer here is "trans", which is not 'drop', so it proceeds. It also checks if the columns are empty. The columns here are [0], which is not empty (since it's a valid index), so it's included.

The `_iter` method yields a tuple for "trans": ("trans", "Trans()", [0], None). The dictionary comprehension then creates a key "trans" with a `Bunch` object containing all the methods from `METHODS` mapped to empty dictionaries.

Therefore, the output should be a dictionary where "trans" maps to a `Bunch` with all the method keys present, each with an empty dictionary as their value.
