1. The `transform` method is called with `X=[[0, 2],[1, 4],[2, 6]]` and no additional parameters (`**params` is empty).
2. `_raise_for_params` checks if any metadata routing is required, but since `params` is empty and routing is not explicitly enabled, it proceeds without raising an error.
3. `check_is_fitted(self)` verifies that the transformer is fitted. Since the instance has attributes like `n_features_in_`, `transformers_`, etc., it is considered fitted.
4. `_check_X(X)` is called to validate and potentially convert `X`. Here, `X` is a list of lists, so it is converted into a numpy array using `check_array`.
5. The method checks if the input `X` is a pandas DataFrame or has a `__dataframe__` attribute, which it does not, so it skips the DataFrame-specific checks.
6. `_check_n_features(self, X, reset=False)` ensures that the number of features in `X` matches `n_features_in_`. Since `X` has 2 features and `n_features_in_` is also 2, this check passes.
7. `_routing_enabled()` checks if metadata routing is enabled. Assuming it is not enabled (default), it returns `False`.
8. Since routing is not enabled, `_get_empty_routing()` is called, which returns an empty routing structure.
9. `_call_func_on_transformers` is invoked with `_transform_one` as the function to apply to each transformer. It iterates over the transformers (in this case, just "trans") and applies the transformation.
10. For each transformer, `_safe_indexing(X, columns, axis=1)` is used to select the relevant columns from `X` based on the transformer's configuration.
11. The transformed data from each transformer is collected in `Xs`.
12. `_validate_output(Xs)` checks that each transformer's output is 2D (or a DataFrame), which is true in this case.
13. Finally, `_hstack` is called to horizontally stack the transformed outputs. Since `sparse_output_` is `False`, it converts any sparse matrices to arrays and stacks them using `np.hstack`.
14. The resulting array is returned as the output of the `transform` method.
