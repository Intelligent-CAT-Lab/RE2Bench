The function `as_content_primitive` is called on `sqrt(2)`. Since `sqrt(2)` is a `Pow` object with base `2` and exponent `1/2`, we start by calling `as_base_exp` on it. This method checks if the base is a `Rational` number less than 1 and, if so, returns the reciprocal of the base and the negative of the exponent. In this case, the base is `2`, which is not a `Rational` less than 1, so `as_base_exp` returns `(2, 1/2)`.

Next, we call `as_content_primitive` on the base `2` and the exponent `1/2`. The `as_content_primitive` method for `Expr` (the base class of `Pow`) returns `(S.One, self)` because there's no rational content to extract from a simple integer like `2`. So, `b` becomes `2` and `ce` (content of the exponent) becomes `1/2`, with `pe` (primitive of the exponent) being `1`.

Since `b` is not a `Rational`, we skip the part where we try to extract rational content from the exponent. Then, we check if `e` (which is `1/2`) is a `Rational` and if `b` is a `Mul`. Since `b` is just `2` and not a `Mul`, we proceed to return `(S.One, self.func(b, e))`.

The `self.func(b, e)` call reconstructs the original `Pow` object with base `2` and exponent `1/2`, which is `sqrt(2)`. Therefore, the output of `as_content_primitive` is `(1, sqrt(2))`.
