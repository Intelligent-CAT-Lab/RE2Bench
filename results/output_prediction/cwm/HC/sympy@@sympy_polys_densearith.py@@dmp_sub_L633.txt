The function call is `dmp_sub(f=[], g=[], u=0, K="ZZ")`. Since `u` is 0, the function immediately returns `_dmp(dup_sub(_dup(f), _dup(g), K))`.

Breaking it down:
1. `_dup(f)` returns `f` as it is, which is an empty list `[]`.
2. `_dup(g)` returns `g` as it is, which is also an empty list `[]`.
3. `dup_sub([], [], "ZZ")` is called. Since both `f` and `g` are empty, `dup_sub` will return `dup_neg(g, K)`, which is `dup_neg([], "ZZ")`.
4. `dup_neg([], "ZZ")` will return an empty list `[]` because negating an empty list (representing a zero polynomial) still results in an empty list.
5. `_dmp([])` returns `[]` as it is.

Therefore, the final output is an empty list.
