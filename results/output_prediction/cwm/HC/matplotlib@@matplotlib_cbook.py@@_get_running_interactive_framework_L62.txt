We need to simulate the execution of the function `_get_running_interactive_framework` step by step. Let's go through the function line by line.

1. The function starts by checking for the presence of `QtWidgets` from various modules (PyQt6, PySide6, PyQt5, PySide2). Since none of these are likely present in the given context (as the input doesn't mention any GUI frameworks), this check will fail, and the function moves on.

2. Next, the function checks for `Gtk` from `gi.repository.Gtk`. Again, since there's no indication of GTK being present, this check also fails, and the function proceeds.

3. The function then checks for `wx` (wxPython). Similar to the previous checks, since there's no mention of wxPython in the input, this check fails as well.

4. The function then checks for `tkinter`. Since the input doesn't specify any tkinter-related information, this check also fails.

5. The function then checks for `macosx` (Matplotlib's macOS backend). Since there's no indication of a running macOS event loop, this check fails too.

6. The function then checks if the display is valid using `_c_internal_utils.display_is_valid()`. This is a critical point. If the display is not valid (i.e., the code is running in a headless environment), the function returns `'headless'`.

Given that the input doesn't provide any context indicating a valid display or any running GUI framework, the most likely outcome is that the display is invalid, leading the function to return `'headless'`.
