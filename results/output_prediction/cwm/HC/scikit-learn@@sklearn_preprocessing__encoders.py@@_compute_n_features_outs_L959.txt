The function `_compute_n_features_outs` starts by computing the length of each category in `self.categories_`. The input shows that `self.categories_` is a list containing a single string: "['a', 'b']". However, when evaluating `len(cats)`, the string "['a', 'b']" is treated as a single element, so `len(cats)` would be the length of the string, which is 9. But wait, this is incorrect because "['a', 'b']" is a string representation of a list, not an actual list. If the actual value of `self.categories_` were a list like `[['a', 'b']]`, then `len(cats)` would correctly evaluate to 2. However, based on the provided input, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in how `self.categories_` is structured. Assuming that the input is correctly formatted and `self.categories_` is indeed a list of lists (e.g., `[['a', 'b']]`), then the list comprehension would yield `[2]`. 

Next, the code checks if `self._drop_idx_after_grouping` is not None. Since it is None, this block is skipped. Then, it checks if `self._infrequent_enabled` is False, which it is. Therefore, the function returns the `output` list as is. 

Given the assumption that `self.categories_` is a list of lists (e.g., `[['a', 'b']]`), the output would be `[2]`.
