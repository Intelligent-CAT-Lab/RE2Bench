First, the function `get_format` is called with `format_type` as "jS \\o\\f F" and `use_l10n` as None. Since `use_l10n` is None, it attempts to retrieve the `_USE_L10N_INTERNAL` setting from `settings`. However, since it's a `LazySettings` object, it likely checks the actual `USE_L10N` setting. Assuming `USE_L10N` is True (default for Django projects), it proceeds to determine the language. The language is fetched using `get_language()`, which might return the default language code, say 'en-us', if no other language is set.

Next, it checks the cache with the key ("jS \\o\\f F", 'en-us'). If not found, it looks for the format in the specified modules for the language. Since "jS \\o\\f F" is not a standard format type and likely not defined in any of the format modules, it proceeds to check if the format type is in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`. It is not, so it simply returns the `format_type` as is.

Therefore, the output should be "jS \\o\\f F".
