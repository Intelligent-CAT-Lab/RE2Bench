Step 1: The input is a JSON string that needs to be parsed into a Python object. The function _reshape_2D is called with X being a list of lists of floats and name being "X".

Step 2: The function _unpack_to_numpy is called on X. Since X is already a list of lists, it is converted to a numpy array. The resulting array is a 2D array with shape (5, 3).

Step 3: The function checks if X is a numpy array. Since it is, it transposes the array. The resulting array has shape (3, 5).

Step 4: The function checks the number of dimensions of the transposed array. Since it is 2, it reshapes each row into a 1D array and returns a list of these 1D arrays.

Step 5: The resulting list of 1D arrays is returned as the output of the function.
