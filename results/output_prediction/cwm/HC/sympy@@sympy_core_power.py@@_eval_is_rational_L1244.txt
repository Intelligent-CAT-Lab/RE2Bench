Step 1: Analyze the input. The input is a JSON object containing the self object "cos(phi)**2", with no args or kwargs.

Step 2: Identify the relevant function. The function to be executed is `_eval_is_rational` from the `Pow` class.

Step 3: Execute the function step-by-step.

Step 4: In the `_eval_is_rational` function, the first condition checks if `self.exp.is_integer` and `self.base.is_rational` and `fuzzy_not(fuzzy_and([self.exp.is_negative, self.base.is_zero]))`. 

Step 5: Since `self` is "cos(phi)**2", `self.exp` is 2 (an integer) and `self.base` is "cos(phi)" (not rational). Therefore, the first condition is false.

Step 6: The function then calls `p = self.func(*self.as_base_exp())`. 

Step 7: `self.as_base_exp()` returns `(b, e)` where `b` is the base and `e` is the exponent. Since `self.base` is "cos(phi)" (not rational), `self.as_base_exp()` returns ("cos(phi)", 2).

Step 8: `self.func(*self.as_base_exp())` calls the `Pow` function with the base "cos(phi)" and exponent 2, resulting in "cos(phi)**2".

Step 9: The function then checks if `p.is_Pow` is true. Since "cos(phi)**2" is a `Pow` object, this condition is true.

Step 10: The function then checks if `e.is_Rational` and `b.is_Rational`. Since `e` is 2 (an integer) and `b` is "cos(phi)" (not rational), this condition is false.

Step 11: The function then checks if `e.is_integer`. Since `e` is 2 (an integer), this condition is true.

Step 12: The function then checks if `b.is_rational`. Since `b` is "cos(phi)" (not rational), this condition is false.

Step 13: The function then checks if `b.is_irrational`. Since "cos(phi)" is not an irrational number, this condition is false.

Step 14: The function then checks if `b is S.Exp1`. Since "cos(phi)" is not equal to `S.Exp1`, this condition is false.

Step 15: Since none of the conditions are met, the function returns `None`.
