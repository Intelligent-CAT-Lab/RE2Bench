Let's analyze the execution step-by-step:

1. The function `extract` is called with `rows = [0, 1, 2]` and `cols = [0]`.
2. Since the input `self` has an empty structure (`{}`), the condition `if not (self and rows and cols):` evaluates to `True`.
3. Therefore, the function returns `self.zeros((len(rows), len(cols)), self.domain)`.
4. `self.zeros` is called with shape `(3, 1)` and domain `"ZZ"`.
5. The `zeros` method returns an `SDM` object with an empty dictionary `{}`, shape `(3, 1)`, and domain `"ZZ"`.

The output is an `SDM` object representing a 3x1 matrix with all elements zero, in the domain of integers (`ZZ`).
