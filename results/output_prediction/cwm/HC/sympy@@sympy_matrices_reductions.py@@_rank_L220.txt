1. `M` is a 3x3 matrix where each element is 1.
2. The function checks if the number of rows or columns is 0 or less. Since both are 3, this condition is false.
3. Next, it checks if the number of rows or columns is 1 or less. Since both are 3, this condition is also false.
4. Then, it checks if the matrix is 2x2. Since it's 3x3, this condition is false.
5. The function calls `_permute_complexity_right` to permute the matrix such that columns with more complex elements are moved to the right.
    a. For each column, it calculates the "complexity" by counting how many elements are not zero (using `iszerofunc`).
    b. The matrix is permuted based on this complexity, but since all elements are 1 (not zero), the permutation doesn't change the matrix.
6. After permutation, the function calls `_row_reduce` to perform row reduction on the matrix.
    a. `_row_reduce` reduces the matrix to row-echelon form.
    b. Since all elements are 1, the row reduction will result in a matrix where the first row is [1, 1, 1], and the other rows are [0, 0, 0].
    c. The pivot columns are identified, which in this case are only the first column.
7. The function returns the number of pivot columns, which is 1.
