The function `fix_style` is called with the argument `s` set to `"_classic_test_patch"`. 

Since `s` is a string, the function checks if it exists in the `style_alias` dictionary. However, `style_alias` contains the keys `'mpl20'` and `'mpl15'`, and neither of these match `"_classic_test_patch"`. Therefore, `s` remains unchanged.

Next, the function checks if `s` is in the `_DEPRECATED_SEABORN_STYLES` dictionary. This dictionary contains keys that are deprecated seaborn styles, but `"_classic_test_patch"` is not among them. So, no deprecation warning is issued, and `s` is returned as is.
