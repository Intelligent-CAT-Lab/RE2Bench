I need to figure out the output of the `resolve_backend` method given the provided input. Let's walk through the code step by step.

First, the input specifies that `backend` is "agg". The method checks if `backend` is a string and converts it to lowercase. Since "agg" is already lowercase, this part doesn't change anything.

Next, it looks up the GUI framework for "agg" in the `_BUILTIN_BACKEND_TO_GUI_FRAMEWORK` dictionary. Looking at that dictionary, "agg" maps to "headless". So `gui` becomes "headless".

Since `gui` is not `None` and not "unknown", the code skips the part where it would load entry points or check the module. It also skips the part where it would call `_get_gui_framework_by_loading` because `gui` is already determined to be "headless".

Finally, the method returns a tuple where the first element is the `backend` ("agg") and the second element is `None` because `gui` is "headless". So the output should be a tuple ("agg", None).

    "output": ["agg", null]
