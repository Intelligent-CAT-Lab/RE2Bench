Step 1: The `should_bypass_proxies` function is called with `url="http://localhost:48329/"` and `no_proxy=None`.

Step 2: Inside the function, `no_proxy_arg` is assigned the value of `no_proxy`, which is `None`.

Step 3: Since `no_proxy` is `None`, the function calls `get_proxy('no_proxy')` to retrieve the value of the `no_proxy` environment variable.

Step 4: The `get_proxy` function is called with `'no_proxy'` as the key. It checks both lowercase and uppercase versions of the key in the environment variables.

Step 5: Assuming the `no_proxy` environment variable is set to `'example.com'`, the `get_proxy` function returns `'example.com'`.

Step 6: The `urlparse` function is called with the `url` parameter to parse the URL into its components.

Step 7: The `parsed` object contains the parsed URL components, including the hostname, which is `'localhost'`.

Step 8: Since `no_proxy` is not `None` (it's `'example.com'`), the function processes the `no_proxy` value.

Step 9: The `no_proxy` string is split into a list of hosts, and a generator expression is created to iterate over these hosts.

Step 10: The function checks if the hostname is an IPv4 address using the `is_ipv4_address` function.

Step 11: Since `'localhost'` is not a valid IPv4 address, the function proceeds to check if the hostname matches any of the hosts in the `no_proxy` list.

Step 12: The function checks if `'localhost'` ends with any of the hosts in the `no_proxy` list (in this case, `'example.com'`).

Step 13: Since `'localhost'` does not end with `'example.com'`, the function continues.

Step 14: The function uses the `set_environ` context manager to set the `no_proxy` environment variable to its original value (`None`) and calls the `proxy_bypass` function with the hostname `'localhost'`.

Step 15: The `proxy_bypass` function is assumed to return `True` for the hostname `'localhost'`.

Step 16: Since `bypass` is `True`, the function returns `True`.
