The function `get_partition_for_region` is called with the argument `region_name='foo-bar-1'`. Inside this function, it calls `self._session.get_partition_for_region(region_name)`. 

Given that `self._session` is a mock object representing a session, and assuming that the mock object's `get_partition_for_region` method is properly set up to return a partition name based on the region, the output would be the partition name associated with the region 'foo-bar-1'. 

However, without knowing the exact implementation details of the mock object or the partition configuration, the exact output cannot be determined. But based on typical AWS partition behavior, 'foo-bar-1' might not be a standard region, so it might return a default partition or raise an error. 

For the purpose of this task, let's assume that the mock object is set up to return a valid partition name for the given region.
