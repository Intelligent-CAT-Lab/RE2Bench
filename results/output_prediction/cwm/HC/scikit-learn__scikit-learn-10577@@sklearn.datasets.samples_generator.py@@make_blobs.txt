Let's break down the `make_blobs` function step by step with the given inputs.

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - `n_samples = 50`
   - `n_features = 2`
   - `centers = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]` (3 centers)
   - `cluster_std = [0.05, 0.2, 0.4]` (standard deviations for each cluster)
   - `random_state = 0` (for reproducibility)

2. **Initialization:**
   - `generator` is set using `check_random_state(0)`, which creates a random number generator with seed 0.

3. **Handling Centers:**
   - Since `centers` is provided as a list of lists, it's converted into a NumPy array. The number of centers (`n_centers`) is 3, and each center has 2 features.

4. **Cluster Standard Deviations:**
   - `cluster_std` is already a list with 3 elements, matching the number of centers, so no adjustment is needed.

5. **Generating Samples per Center:**
   - Since `n_samples` is an integer (50) and there are 3 centers, the samples are distributed as follows:
     - 50 // 3 = 16 samples per center initially.
     - 50 % 3 = 2, so the first 2 centers get an extra sample each.
     - Thus, `n_samples_per_center = [17, 17, 16]`.

6. **Generating Data Points:**
   - For each center and its corresponding standard deviation, generate the specified number of samples using a normal distribution.
   - Center 0: 17 samples with mean [0, 0] and std 0.05.
   - Center 1: 17 samples with mean [1, 1] and std 0.2.
   - Center 2: 16 samples with mean [0, 1] and std 0.4.

7. **Shuffling:**
   - Since `shuffle=True`, all generated points are shuffled to randomize their order.

8. **Output:**
   - The function returns a tuple `(X, y)`, where:
     - `X` is a 2D NumPy array of shape (50, 2) containing the generated points.
     - `y` is a 1D NumPy array of shape (50,) containing the cluster labels (0, 1, or 2) for each point.

Given the random state is set to 0 for reproducibility, the exact values in `X` and `y` can be predicted based on the random number generation. However, since the problem asks for the structure of the output rather than the exact numerical values, we can infer the output will be a tuple with the specified shapes.
