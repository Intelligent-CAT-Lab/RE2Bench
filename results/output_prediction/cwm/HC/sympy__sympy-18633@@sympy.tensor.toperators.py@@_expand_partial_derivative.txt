We are given a PartialDerivative object with no indices, free indices, or dummy indices. The _expand_partial_derivative method is called. 

First, it calls _contract_indices_for_derivative with the current expression (expr) and variables. Since there are no variables, it should return the original expression with no changes to the indices or free/dummy indices.

Then, it creates a new object (obj) of the same class (PartialDerivative) with the same arguments. It sets the _indices, _free, and _dum attributes of obj to the values returned by _contract_indices_for_derivative.

Since the original expression has no free symbols, it returns S.Zero immediately.
