Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. The function `fit` is called on an instance of `_BinMapper` with the provided inputs.
2. First, it checks if `n_bins` is between 3 and 256. Since `n_bins` is 11, this condition is satisfied.
3. The input `X` is a 2D array, which is converted using `check_array` to ensure it's a valid numeric array. The array has 6 samples and 2 features.
4. A random state is created using `check_random_state` with the seed 42.
5. Since `subsample` is 200000 and the number of samples (6) is less than 200000, no subsampling occurs.
6. `is_categorical` is `None`, so `self.is_categorical_` is initialized as an array of zeros with the same length as the number of features (2).
7. `known_categories` is `None`, so it's set to a list of `None` values for each feature.
8. The code then checks for consistency between `is_categorical` and `known_categories`. Since both are `None` for all features, no exceptions are raised.
9. `missing_values_bin_idx_` is set to `n_bins - 1`, which is 10.
10. `bin_thresholds_` is initialized as a list of `None` values for each feature.
11. `n_bins_non_missing` is also initialized as a list of `None` values for each feature.
12. The code uses `Parallel` to compute binning thresholds for non-categorical features in parallel. Since there are 2 features and `is_categorical_` is all zeros (non-categorical), it will compute thresholds for both features.
13. The results from the parallel computation are stored in `non_cat_thresholds`.
14. The code then iterates over each feature. For non-categorical features (both features in this case), it assigns the computed thresholds to `bin_thresholds_` and updates `n_bins_non_missing` based on the number of thresholds plus one.
15. Finally, `n_bins_non_missing_` is set as a numpy array of `n_bins_non_missing` values.

The output of the function is the instance of `_BinMapper` itself, which now has the computed bin thresholds and other attributes set.
