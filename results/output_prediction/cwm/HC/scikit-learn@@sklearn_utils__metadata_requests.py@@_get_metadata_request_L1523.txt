Let's analyze the execution of the `_get_metadata_request` function step by step.

1. The function begins by checking if the instance (`self`) has an attribute called `_metadata_request`.
   - In this case, it does. The `_metadata_request` attribute is a dictionary-like object containing metadata requests for various methods.

2. Since `_metadata_request` exists, the function calls `get_routing_for_object(self._metadata_request)`.
   - The `get_routing_for_object` function checks if the provided object (in this case, `self._metadata_request`) has a `get_metadata_routing` method. If not, it checks if the object's type is "metadata_request" or "metadata_router". If neither condition is met, it returns a default `MetadataRequest` object with `owner=None`.

3. Assuming `self._metadata_request` does not have a `get_metadata_routing` method and its type is not "metadata_request" or "metadata_router", the function will return a new `MetadataRequest` instance with `owner=None`.

4. The returned `MetadataRequest` instance is assigned to the `requests` variable and returned as the result of `_get_metadata_request`.

Given the input provided, where `self._metadata_request` is a dictionary-like object and not an instance of `MetadataRequest` or `MetadataRouter`, the function will return a new `MetadataRequest` instance with `owner=None`.
