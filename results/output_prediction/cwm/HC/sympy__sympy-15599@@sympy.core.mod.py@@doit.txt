Let's analyze the `doit` function step by step with the given input:

The function is called with `p = 2*t` and `q = t`. 

1. First, it checks if `q == S.Zero`, which is not true because `q` is `t`.

2. Then it checks if `p` or `q` are infinite or NaN, which is also not true.

3. The function proceeds to check if `p` is equal to `q`, `-q`, or if `p` is zero, which is not the case here.

4. Next, it checks if `q` is a number. Since `q` is `t` (a symbolic variable), this condition is false.

5. The function then checks if `p` has a method `_eval_Mod` and attempts to evaluate it, but since `p = 2*t` is a Mul object and does not have such a method, this part is skipped.

6. It calculates `r = p / q` which equals `2`.

7. The function then tries to convert `r` to an integer, which succeeds, resulting in `d = 2`.

8. It calculates `rv = p - d * q` which gives `2*t - 2*t = 0`.

9. Since `rv * q` equals `0` (which is not less than zero), the condition `(rv * q < 0) == True` is false, so `rv` remains `0`.

10. The function then returns `rv`, which is `0`.

Thus, the output of `doit` is `0`.
