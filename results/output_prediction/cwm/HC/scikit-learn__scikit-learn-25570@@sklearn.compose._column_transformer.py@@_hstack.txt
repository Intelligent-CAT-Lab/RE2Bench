The function `_hstack` is responsible for horizontally stacking the transformed output from various transformers applied to the input data. In this case, `Xs` is null, meaning there are no transformed outputs to stack. The function first checks if `self.sparse_output_` is True, which it's not. Therefore, it proceeds to convert any sparse matrices in `Xs` to dense arrays, but since `Xs` is null, this step is skipped. Then, it checks the output configuration to determine if the result should be a pandas DataFrame. However, since `Xs` is null, the function returns a zero matrix with the same number of rows as the input data and zero columns.
