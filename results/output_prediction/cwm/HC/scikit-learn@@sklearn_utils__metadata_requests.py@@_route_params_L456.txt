Step 1: Analyze the input parameters.
The function `_route_params` is called with the following parameters:
- self: An object with `_requests`, `owner`, and `method` attributes.
- params: A dictionary containing "sample_weight" and "metadata" keys with values [1] and "a", respectively.
- parent: A string representing the parent object.
- caller: The method name "fit_transform".

Step 2: Call `_check_warnings`.
The function checks if any metadata marked as WARN is present in the params. Since there are no WARN requests in the provided `_requests`, this step does nothing.

Step 3: Process the params dictionary.
The `args` dictionary is created by filtering out any None values from `params`. Since both "sample_weight" and "metadata" have non-None values, `args` will include both keys.

Step 4: Initialize the `res` and `unrequested` dictionaries.
`res` is an empty Bunch object, and `unrequested` is an empty dictionary.

Step 5: Iterate over the `_requests` items.
For each property and alias in `_requests`:
- "sample_weight" has an alias of True. Since "sample_weight" is in `args`, it is added to `res`.
- "metadata" has an alias of True. Since "metadata" is in `args`, it is added to `res`.

Step 6: Check for unrequested parameters.
Since `unrequested` is empty, no exception is raised.

Step 7: Return the `res` object.
The `res` object now contains "sample_weight" and "metadata" with their respective values from `args`.
