Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line `A, B = map(int, input().split())` takes the input string "20 30" and splits it into two parts. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each part, which converts them to integers `A = 20` and `B = 30`.

2. The second line `ans = A - 2 * B` computes the value of `ans` by subtracting twice the value of `B` from `A`. Substituting the values, we get `ans = 20 - 2 * 30 = 20 - 60 = -40`.

3. The third line `if ans < 0:` checks if `ans` is less than zero, which is true in this case (`-40 < 0`).

4. The fourth line `ans = 0` updates the value of `ans` to `0` because the condition in the if statement is true.

5. The fifth line `print(ans)` prints the final value of `ans`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the final output is:
