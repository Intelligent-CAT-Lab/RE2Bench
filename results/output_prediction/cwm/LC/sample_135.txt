Let's break down the execution of the function `f` step by step.

1. The function `f` is defined, and when it is called, the following line is executed:
   `d = {'Russia': [('Moscow', 'Russia'), ('Vladivostok', 'Russia')], 'Kazakhstan': [('Astana', 'Kazakhstan')]}`. 
   This creates a dictionary `d` with keys 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'. Each key maps to a list of tuples representing cities and their respective countries.

2. Next, the line `return list(d.keys())` is executed. The `.keys()` method of a dictionary returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary. By converting this view object to a list using `list()`, we get a list of the keys. 

   In this case, the keys of the dictionary `d` are 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'. Therefore, the function returns the list `['Russia', 'Kazakhstan']`.
