Let's go through the function step by step to determine its output. The function `generate_email_pattern` is part of the `RegexUtils` class. 

1. The function starts by defining a variable `pattern` that contains a regular expression pattern.
2. The pattern is assigned the string value `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b`.
   - `\\b` is used to assert word boundaries. 
   - `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more characters that are letters, numbers, or specific special characters (., _%, +, -) for the local part of the email.
   - `@` is the literal at symbol.
   - `[A-Za-z0-9.-]+` matches one or more characters for the domain part (letters, numbers, dots, hyphens).
   - `\\.` matches a literal dot before the domain extension.
   - `[A-Z|a-z]{2,}` matches the domain extension (letters only, 2 or more characters long).
   - `\\b` again asserts a word boundary at the end.
3. The function returns the `pattern` variable.

Therefore, the output of the function is the regular expression pattern defined in the string.
