The function `__format_line_feed` replaces consecutive newline characters in a text with a single newline character. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the execution:

1. The function `__format_line_feed` is called with the input text `"Some sentence here."`.
2. The regular expression `re.compile('\\n+')` is used to match one or more consecutive newline characters (`\n+`).
3. The `re.sub` function is used to replace all occurrences of the matched pattern (`\n+`) with a single newline character (`\n`).
4. Since the input text `"Some sentence here."` does not contain any newline characters, the output of `re.sub` will be the same as the input text.

Therefore, the output of the function will be `"Some sentence here."`.
