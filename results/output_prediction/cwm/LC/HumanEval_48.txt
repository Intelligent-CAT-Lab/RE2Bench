Let's walk through the execution of the `is_palindrome` function with the input `"xywzx"`.

The function starts by looping through each character in the string using `for i in range(len(text))`. The goal is to compare the character at position `i` with the character at position `len(text) - 1 - i`. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns `False`, indicating the string is not a palindrome.

1. **Loop iteration i = 0**: 
   - Compare `text[0]` (which is `'x'`) with `text[4]` (which is `'x'`). They match.
   
2. **Loop iteration i = 1**: 
   - Compare `text[1]` (which is `'y'`) with `text[3]` (which is `'z'`). They do not match.

Since there is a mismatch at i = 1, the function immediately returns `False`.
