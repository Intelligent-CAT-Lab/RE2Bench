Let's go through the execution step by step.

The function `dup_abs` takes two arguments: `f` and `K`. The function iterates through each coefficient in the list `f` and applies the `K.abs` method to each coefficient, returning a new list with the absolute values of these coefficients.

1. The input `f` is the list `[2]`, which contains a single element, the number 2.
2. The input `K` is the string "ZZ", which likely represents the `ZZ` class from SymPy, where the `abs` method can be applied to integers.

The function will iterate over the elements in `f`:
- The first (and only) element is `2`. Applying `K.abs(2)` results in `2` since the absolute value of `2` is `2`.

Therefore, the output of the function is a list containing the single element `2`.
