Let's go step by step through the execution of the function.

1. The function is called with `planet1 = "Earth"` and `planet2 = "Earth"`.

2. A tuple named `planet_names` is created, containing the names of the planets in order: ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune').

3. The next line checks if `planet1` is not in `planet_names`, or `planet2` is not in `planet_names`, or if `planet1` is equal to `planet2`. In this case, since `planet1 == planet2` (both are "Earth"), the condition evaluates to `True`.

4. Because the condition is `True`, the function returns an empty tuple `()` immediately.

Therefore, the function will return an empty tuple as the output.
