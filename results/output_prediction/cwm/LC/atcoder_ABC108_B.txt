Let's go through the code step by step with the given input.

1. The input is "100 100 100 99". Using the `split()` function, this is split into a list of strings: `["100", "100", "100", "99"]`.
2. The `map(int, ...)` function is applied to convert these strings into integers: `(100, 100, 100, 99)`.
3. The values are assigned as follows:
   - `x1 = 100`
   - `y1 = 100`
   - `x2 = 100`
   - `y2 = 99`
4. The code then calculates:
   - `a = x2 - x1 = 100 - 100 = 0`
   - `b = y2 - y1 = 99 - 100 = -1`
5. The final output is calculated using the print statement:
   - `x2 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y2 + a = 99 + 0 = 99`
   - `x1 - b = 100 - (-1) = 101`
   - `y1 + a = 100 + 0 = 100`

Therefore, the output will be the values of these expressions printed in the order specified.
