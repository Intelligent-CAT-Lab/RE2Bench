Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. The code reads the input from stdin using `stdin = input()`. The input provided is `"BBA"`.

2. The string is assigned to variable `s`: `s = stdin`. So now, `s` holds the value `"BBA"`.

3. The next line checks if both 'A' and 'B' are present in the string `s` using the condition `'A' in s and 'B' in s`. Since 'A' and 'B' are both present in `"BBA"`, this condition evaluates to `True`.

4. Based on the condition, the variable `result` is assigned the value `'Yes'` because the condition is true.

5. Finally, the code prints the value of `result`, which is `'Yes'`.

So, the output of the program is 'Yes'.
