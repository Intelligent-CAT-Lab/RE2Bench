Let's walk through the execution of the `right_angle_triangle` function step by step.

The function is defined as:
```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b
```

Given the input arguments:
- `a = 10`
- `b = 6`
- `c = 8`

The function evaluates the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

The function checks all three possibilities:
1. Is `a` the hypotenuse? (i.e., does `a * a == b * b + c * c` hold?)
2. Is `b` the hypotenuse? (i.e., does `b * b == a * a + c * c` hold?)
3. Is `c` the hypotenuse? (i.e., does `c * c == a * a + b * b` hold?)

Now let's compute each condition:

1. `a * a == b * b + c * c`
   - `10 * 10 = 100`
   - `6 * 6 + 8 * 8 = 36 + 64 = 100`
   - So, `100 == 100` is `True`

Since the first condition is `True`, the entire expression returns `True` without evaluating the other conditions (due to short-circuit evaluation in Python).

Therefore, the function returns `True`.
