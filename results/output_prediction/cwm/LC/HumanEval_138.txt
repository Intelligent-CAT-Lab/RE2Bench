Let's break down the function execution step by step.

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` is defined as:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```

The input provided is:
- `n = 10`

Now, let's evaluate the condition `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`:
1. `n % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n` is even. Since 10 divided by 2 leaves no remainder, this condition is `True`.
2. `n >= 8`: This checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8. Since 10 is indeed greater than 8, this condition is also `True`.

Because both conditions are `True`, the logical `and` operator returns `True`. Therefore, the function will return `True`.
