Let's go through the execution step by step.

1. The function `compare_one` is called with `a=1` and `b="2,3"`.

2. `temp_a` is assigned the value of `a`, which is `1`, and `temp_b` is assigned the value of `b`, which is `"2,3"`.

3. The first `if` checks if `temp_a` is a string. Since `temp_a` is an integer (`1`), this condition is false, and no action is taken.

4. The second `if` checks if `temp_b` is a string. Since `temp_b` is a string (`"2,3"`), this condition is true.

5. Inside this `if` block, `temp_b` is modified by replacing the comma (`,`) with a period (`.`). So `"2,3"` becomes `"2.3"`.

6. Now, `temp_a` is `1` (an integer) and `temp_b` is `"2.3"` (a string). Both are converted to floats using `float(temp_a)` and `float(temp_b)`, resulting in `1.0` and `2.3`, respectively.

7. The function compares these two float values: `1.0` is not equal to `2.3`, so it skips the `if float(temp_a) == float(temp_b):` block.

8. Since `1.0` is not greater than `2.3`, the function returns `b`, which is `"2,3"`.
