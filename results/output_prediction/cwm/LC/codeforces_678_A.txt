I will simulate the execution of the code step by step. Here's what happens:
1. The program reads a line of input from the user, which contains two integers separated by a space.
2. These integers are converted into variables `vamshi` and `z` using the `map` function and then split by spaces.
3. The program then calculates the result of `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`. This can be broken down into three operations:
   - Integer division `vamshi // z` gives the quotient of dividing `vamshi` by `z`.
   - Adding 1 to the quotient shifts it up.
   - Multiplying the result by `z` rounds the result up to the nearest multiple of `z`.
4. For the given input, "14 15", vamshi is assigned the value 14 and z is assigned the value 15.
5. So the expression becomes `(14 // 15 + 1) * 15`.
   - `14 // 15` evaluates to `0`.
   - Adding 1 to this quotient gives `1`.
   - Multiplying by `z` (15) gives `1 * 15 = 15`.
