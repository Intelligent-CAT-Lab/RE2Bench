Step 1: The function `fit_transform` is called on an instance of `LabelEncoder`. The input `y` is provided as an array of integers.

Step 2: The first line inside the function is `y = column_or_1d(y, warn=True)`. This line ensures that the input `y` is converted into a 1D array. Since the input is already a 1D array, this step simply returns the same array.

Step 3: Next, the function calls `self.classes_, y = _unique(y, return_inverse=True)`. The `_unique` function finds all unique values in `y` and assigns them to `self.classes_`. It also returns the indices of these unique values, which are stored back in `y`. 

Step 4: The array `y` contains integers from 0 to 1. The unique values in `y` are 0 and 1, so `self.classes_` becomes `[0, 1]`. The `y` array is then replaced with the indices of these unique values, which effectively maps each value in `y` to its index in `self.classes_`. 

Step 5: Since the input array `y` has the values [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the transformed `y` will be an array of 0s and 1s corresponding to the indices of 0 and 1 in `self.classes_`.

Step 6: The function then returns the transformed `y` array.
