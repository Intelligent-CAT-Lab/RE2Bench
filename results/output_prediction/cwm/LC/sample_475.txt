Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. The function `f` is called with `array = [1]` and `index = 0`.
2. The function checks if `index < 0`. In this case, `index` is 0, so the condition is false, and the code skips the adjustment of the index.
3. The function then returns `array[index]`, which is `array[0]`.
4. The value at `array[0]` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the function is 1.
