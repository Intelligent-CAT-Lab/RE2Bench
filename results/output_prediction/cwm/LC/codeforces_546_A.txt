Let's go through the code step by step.

The input is `"1 1 1"`, which means k=1, n=1, w=1.

1. The variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
2. The loop runs for i in range(1, w+1), which is range(1, 2), so it runs once with i=1.
3. Inside the loop, `sum` is updated to `sum + k * i`, which is 0 + 1 * 1 = 1.
4. After the loop, the code checks if `sum` is less than or equal to `n`. In this case, `sum` is 1 and `n` is 1, so the condition is true.
5. The code prints 0.

So the output will be 0.
