Step 1: The `__eq__` method of the `IndirectReference` class is called with `other` being a list `[1, 2]`.
Step 2: Inside the method, the first condition checks if `other.__class__` is the same as `self.__class__`. Since `other` is a list and `self` is an instance of `IndirectReference`, their classes are not the same.
Step 3: The condition `other.__class__ is self.__class__` evaluates to `False`, so the rest of the conditions are not checked due to short-circuiting in logical `and` operations.
Step 4: The method returns `False` immediately because the first condition fails.
