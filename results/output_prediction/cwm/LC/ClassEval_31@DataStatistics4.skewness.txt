Let's execute the skewness function step by step.

1. The input data is [1, 1, 1]. The length of the data, n, is 3.

2. Calculate the mean: sum(data) / n = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

3. Calculate the variance: sum(((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data)) / n. 
   For each x in data:
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   - (1 - 1) ** 2 = 0
   Sum is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. 
   Variance is 0 / 3 = 0.

4. Calculate the standard deviation: math.sqrt(variance) = sqrt(0) = 0.

5. Calculate the skewness. Since std_deviation is 0, the function returns 0.

So, the output of the function will be 0.
