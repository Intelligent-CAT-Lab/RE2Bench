1. The function `_mac_arch` takes two parameters: `arch` and `is_32bit`. In this case, `arch` is "x86_64" and `is_32bit` is True.
2. The first condition checks if `is_32bit` is False. Since it's True, this condition is skipped.
3. The next condition checks if `arch` starts with 'ppc'. Since "x86_64" does not start with 'ppc', this condition is also skipped.
4. The function then returns 'i386' because none of the previous conditions were met.
