Let's walk through how the function TR111 processes the input "cos(phi)**2".

1. The function TR111 is called with rv = cos(phi)**2.
2. Inside TR111, it defines a helper function f and applies it to rv using bottom_up traversal.
3. The bottom_up function starts by checking if rv has args. Since rv is a Pow object (cos(phi)**2), it has args.
4. It recursively applies bottom_up to each argument in args. The args of Pow are (cos(phi), 2).
5. For cos(phi), it's a TrigonometricFunction, so it has args. It applies bottom_up to phi (which has no args and isn't modified).
6. Since cos(phi) isn't a Pow object, the helper function f returns it unchanged.
7. For the exponent 2, it's an Integer, so bottom_up leaves it unchanged.
8. Now, the Pow object is reconstructed with args (cos(phi), 2).
9. The helper function f is applied to this Pow object. Since the base is cos (a TrigonometricFunction), it checks if it's cos, sin, or tan.
10. It finds that the base is cos, so it replaces cos(phi)**2 with sec(phi)**(-2).
11. The bottom_up function returns this new expression.
