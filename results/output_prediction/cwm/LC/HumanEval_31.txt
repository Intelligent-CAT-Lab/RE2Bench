Okay, let's analyze the code step by step to determine if 13441 is a prime number using the given function.

The function is_prime(n) checks whether n is a prime number. Here's how it works:

1. If n is less than 2, it immediately returns False since primes are greater than 1.
2. Then, it iterates from k = 2 up to n - 2 (since the range is exclusive of the upper limit, n-1 is the last number checked).
3. For each k, it checks if n is divisible by k (n % k == 0). If it is, the function returns False because n has a divisor other than 1 and itself.
4. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns True, indicating n is prime.

Now, let's apply this to n = 13441.

First, since 13441 is greater than 2, the initial check (if n < 2) is skipped.

Next, the loop runs from k = 2 to k = 13440 (since n - 1 is 13440). However, this loop is inefficient for large numbers because it checks every number up to n-1, which is unnecessary. For a prime number, it's sufficient to check up to the square root of n, but the function as written doesn't optimize this.

The critical part is determining whether any number between 2 and 13440 divides 13441 evenly.

But wait, let's think about the actual value of 13441. Is it a prime number?

I recall that 13441 is actually a known prime number. However, to be thorough, let's consider how the function would handle it.

The loop will check each k from 2 upwards. For 13441 to be prime, none of these k values should divide it evenly. If during the loop, any k divides 13441, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding any such k, it returns True.

Given that 13441 is indeed a prime number, the loop will not find any divisors, and the function will return True.
