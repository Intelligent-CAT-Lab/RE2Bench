Let's go through the code step by step.

1. The function `is_simple_power` is called with `x = 1` and `n = 1`.

2. The first line checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is indeed 1, this condition is true.

3. The function then returns the result of the comparison `x == 1`. Since `x` is also 1, this comparison evaluates to `True`.

4. The loop is not executed because the condition `n == 1` was met and the function already returned a value.

Therefore, the output of the function is `True`.
