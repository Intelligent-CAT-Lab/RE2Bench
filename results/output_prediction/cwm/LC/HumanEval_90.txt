Let's step through the code execution line by line.

1. The function `next_smallest` is called with the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2].
2. The line `lst = sorted(set(lst))` is executed:
   - `set(lst)` removes duplicate elements. Since there are no duplicates in the list, the set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
   - `sorted(set(lst))` sorts the set in ascending order, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
   - The local variable `lst` is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
3. The line `return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]` is executed:
   - The length of `lst` is 5, which is greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `lst[1]` is returned, which is 2.
