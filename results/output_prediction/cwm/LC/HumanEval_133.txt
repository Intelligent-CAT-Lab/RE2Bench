Let's walk through the function execution step by step.

The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each element in the list. The ceiling function `math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

1. The list provided is `[-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]`.
2. Initialize `squared` to 0.
3. Loop through each element in the list:
   - First element: `-1.4`
     - `math.ceil(-1.4)` gives `-1` (since the smallest integer greater than or equal to `-1.4` is `-1`).
     - Square of `-1` is `1`. Add to `squared`, now `squared = 1`.
   - Second element: `17.9`
     - `math.ceil(17.9)` gives `18`.
     - Square of `18` is `324`. Add to `squared`, now `squared = 325`.
   - Third element: `18.9`
     - `math.ceil(18.9)` gives `19`.
     - Square of `19` is `361`. Add to `squared`, now `squared = 686`.
   - Fourth element: `19.9`
     - `math.ceil(19.9)` gives `20`.
     - Square of `20` is `400`. Add to `squared`, now `squared = 1086`.
4. Return the value of `squared`.

The final result should be `1086`.
