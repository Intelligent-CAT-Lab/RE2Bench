We are executing the function `f` with the input `names = ["sharron", "Savannah", "Mike Cherokee"]`. Let's step through the function:

1. The function starts by calculating the length of the list `names`, which is 3. This is stored in the variable `count`.
2. Then, it initializes `numberOfNames` to 0. This will keep track of how many strings in the list consist solely of alphabetic characters.
3. The function enters a `for` loop, iterating through each item in the list `names`.
   a. First iteration: the item is "sharron". It checks if this string is entirely alphabetic using the `.isalpha()` method. Since "sharron" contains only alphabetic characters, this returns `True`. The variable `numberOfNames` is incremented by 1, becoming 1.
   b. Second iteration: the item is "Savannah". It checks if this string is entirely alphabetic. "Savannah" consists solely of alphabetic characters, so the condition is true. The variable `numberOfNames` is incremented by 1, becoming 2.
   c. Third iteration: the item is "Mike Cherokee". It checks if this string is entirely alphabetic. However, this string contains a space, which is not an alphabetic character. Thus, the condition is false, and `numberOfNames` remains 2.
4. Once the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `numberOfNames`, which is 2.
