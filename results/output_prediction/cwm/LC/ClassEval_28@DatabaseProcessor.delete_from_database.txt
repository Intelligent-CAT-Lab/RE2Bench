I will walk through the given code step by step. The function `delete_from_database` is being executed with the parameters:

- self.database_name = "test.db"
- table_name = "test_table"
- name = "Alice"

1. The function initializes a connection to the SQLite database named "test.db" using `sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)`. This returns a connection object, which is stored in the variable `conn`.

2. It then retrieves a cursor object from the connection using `conn.cursor()`. The cursor is used to execute SQL queries. The cursor object is stored in the variable `cursor`.

3. The code constructs a SQL delete query by formatting the string `DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name = ?` with the provided `table_name`. Since `table_name` is "test_table", the resulting query is `DELETE FROM test_table WHERE name = ?`.

4. The query is executed using the `cursor.execute()` method, passing the query and a tuple containing the value for the parameter `name`, which is "Alice".

5. After executing the delete operation, the changes are committed to the database using `conn.commit()`.

6. Finally, the connection to the database is closed using `conn.close()`.

Since the code does not return any value explicitly, the output of the `delete_from_database` function will be `None`.
