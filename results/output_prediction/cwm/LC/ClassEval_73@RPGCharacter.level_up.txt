Let's break down the execution step by step.

1. The `level_up` method is called on an instance of `RPGCharacter` with the following attributes:
   - name: "John"
   - hp: 140
   - attack_power: 30
   - defense: 20
   - level: 3
   - exp: 0

2. The method checks if the current level is less than 100. Since the current level is 3, this condition is true.

3. The level is incremented by 1, so the new level becomes 4.

4. The experience points (`exp`) are reset to 0.

5. The hit points (`hp`) are increased by 20, so 140 + 20 = 160.

6. The attack power is increased by 5, so 30 + 5 = 35.

7. The defense is increased by 5, so 20 + 5 = 25.

8. The method then returns a tuple containing the updated level, hp, attack_power, and defense.
