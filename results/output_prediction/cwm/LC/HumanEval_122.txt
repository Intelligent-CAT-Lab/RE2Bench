Let's step through the function `add_elements` with the given input:

1. **Function definition**: The function is defined to take two arguments, `arr` and `k`.
2. **Input unpacking**: The arguments are set to `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `k = 4`.
3. **Slicing the array**: The code `arr[:k]` takes the first `k` elements from the array `arr`. Since `k = 4`, `arr[:4]` becomes `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.
4. **Filtering elements**: The code `(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)` filters elements from the sliced array where the length of the string representation of each element is less than or equal to 2.
   - For `111`: `len(str(111)) = 3`, so it is filtered out.
   - For `21`: `len(str(21)) = 2`, so it is included.
   - For `3`: `len(str(3)) = 1`, so it is included.
   - For `4000`: `len(str(4000)) = 4`, so it is filtered out.
   - The filtered elements are `[21, 3]`.
5. **Summing the elements**: The function sums the filtered elements `21 + 3`, resulting in `24`.
6. **Return statement**: The function returns the sum, which is `24`.
