Let's break down the function call step by step.

1. The function `_generate_indices` is called with the following arguments:
   - `random_state`: a RandomState object (specifically, "RandomState(MT19937) at 0x70E5E8726140")
   - `bootstrap`: True
   - `n_population`: 4
   - `n_samples`: 1

2. Since `bootstrap` is True, the function executes the line:
   ```python
   indices = random_state.randint(0, n_population, n_samples)
   ```
   This line generates an array of random integers. The parameters are:
   - `0` to `n_population` (exclusive), so the range is [0, 4)
   - `n_samples` is 1, so it generates 1 integer.

3. The `random_state.randint` function will produce a single integer between 0 (inclusive) and 4 (exclusive). Since the random state is fixed (given as "RandomState(MT19937) at 0x70E5E8726140"), the output will be deterministic.

4. To determine the exact output, we need to know what the random state generates. However, without running the code or knowing the internal state of the RandomState object, we can't compute the exact integer. But we can reason about the possible values.

Possible values for `indices` are [0, 1, 2, 3], since it's a single integer in the range [0, 4).

However, the problem statement doesn't provide the actual output of the random number generator, so we have to assume that the function will return an array with one of these values.

But since the problem asks for the output in a specific structure, and given that the function returns an array, the output should be an array with one element, which is an integer between 0 and 3.
