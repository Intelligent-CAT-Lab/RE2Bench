Let's go through the execution step by step.

First, the input is read as "80 970". Using `map(int, input().split())`, we parse this into two integers: a = 80, b = 970.

Then, the variables are initialized:
- x = a = 80
- h = 0
- s = 0

The first while loop runs while x > 0. It decrements x by 1, increments h by 1, and increments s by 1. Since x starts at 80, this loop will run 80 times, resulting in:
- x = 0
- h = 80
- s = 80

Next, the second while loop runs as long as s // b is not equal to 0. This condition is true when s >= b. However, s = 80 and b = 970, so s // b = 0 (since 80 // 970 = 0). Therefore, this loop does not execute at all.

Finally, the program prints the value of h, which is 80.
