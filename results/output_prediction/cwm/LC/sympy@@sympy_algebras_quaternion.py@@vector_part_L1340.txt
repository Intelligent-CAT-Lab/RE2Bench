Let's break down the execution of the `vector_part` function step by step.

1. **Function Definition and Input**:
   - The `vector_part` function is called on an instance of the `Quaternion` class.
   - The input to this function is a `Quaternion` instance with the properties `_real_field` set to `True` and `_norm` set to `null`. However, these properties are not directly used in the `vector_part` function.

2. **Accessing Properties**:
   - Inside the `vector_part` function, it accesses the properties `b`, `c`, and `d` using the `self.args[1]`, `self.args[2]`, and `self.args[3]` respectively.
   - These properties `b`, `c`, and `d` represent the vector part of the quaternion, which are the imaginary components.

3. **Creating a New Quaternion**:
   - The function then creates a new `Quaternion` instance with `a` set to `0` (since the vector part does not include the real component) and `b`, `c`, `d` taken from the current instance.
   - The `Quaternion` constructor is called with these values, along with default parameters for `real_field` and `norm`.

4. **Quaternion Constructor**:
   - The `Quaternion` constructor first converts the input values `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` using `sympify`, which ensures they are symbolic expressions.
   - It checks if any of the components are non-commutative, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, since the inputs are likely to be commutative (e.g., numbers or standard symbolic expressions), this check passes.
   - A new `Quaternion` object is created with the given components, and the `_real_field` and `norm` attributes are set.

5. **Returning the Vector Part**:
   - The new `Quaternion` instance, representing the vector part of the original quaternion, is returned as the result of the `vector_part` function.

Given the provided input and the structure of the `Quaternion` class, the output of the `vector_part` function should be a new `Quaternion` instance with `a` set to `0` and `b`, `c`, `d` taken from the original quaternion. However, since the exact values of `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided in the input, we can infer that the output will be a `Quaternion` object representing the vector part of the input quaternion.
