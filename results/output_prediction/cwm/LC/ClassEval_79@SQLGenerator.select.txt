1. First, the `select` method is called with `fields=None` and `condition="age BETWEEN 10 AND 20"`. Since `fields` is None, the code sets `fields='*'`. 
2. The base SQL query is built as `SELECT * FROM table1`.
3. The `condition` is not None, so `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20` is appended to the query.
4. The final query is `SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;`.

[OUTPUT]

    "output": "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;"
