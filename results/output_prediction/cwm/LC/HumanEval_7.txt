Let's execute the function `filter_by_substring` step by step. The inputs provided are a list of strings and a substring. The goal is to find which strings in the list contain the substring.

1. The input list `strings` is: ["grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"].
2. The input substring is: "run".
3. We loop through each string in the list and check if "run" is a substring of the current string.

- For "grunt": "run" is not a substring, so it is excluded.
- For "trumpet": "run" is a substring, so it is included.
- For "prune": "run" is a substring, so it is included.
- For "gruesome": "run" is not a substring, so it is excluded.

The output list will contain only the strings that meet the condition.
