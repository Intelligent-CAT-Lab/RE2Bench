Let's go through the function `f(dic)` step by step with the given input.

The function is defined as:

```python
def f(dic):
    d = {}
    for key in dic:
        d[key] = dic.popitem(last=False)[1]
    return d
```

And the input to the function is:

```python
f({})
```

### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A new empty dictionary `d` is created.

2. **For Loop:**
   - The loop `for key in dic:` iterates over the keys in the dictionary `dic`.
   - Since `dic` is an empty dictionary (`{}`), there are no keys to iterate over. As a result, the loop body (`d[key] = dic.popitem(last=False)[1]`) is never executed.

3. **Return Statement:**
   - After the loop, the function returns the dictionary `d`, which is still empty because the loop did not execute.

### Final Output:
The function returns an empty dictionary because the input dictionary is empty, and the loop does not run.
