1. Inside `visit_BinOp`, the `node.op` is an instance of `ast.BitOr`, since the `node.left` is an `ast.Name` with `id` 'int' and `node.right` is a `ast.Constant` with value `None`. 
2. Therefore, it enters the `else` clause and returns the join of the string representations of `node.left`, `node.op`, and `node.right` with a space.
3. Visiting `node.left` (which is an `ast.Name` node) would return 'int'.
4. Visiting `node.op` (which is an `ast.BitOr` node) would return '|' .
5. Visiting `node.right` (which is an `ast.Constant` node with value `None`) would return 'None'.
6. So, the final result is the string 'int | None'.
