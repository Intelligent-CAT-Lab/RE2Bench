Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `compare` takes two arguments, `game` and `guess`, which are both lists of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over pairs of elements from `game` and `guess` using `zip(game, guess)`. For each pair `(x, y)`, it calculates the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` and collects these differences into a list.

1. The first pair is `(1, -1)`. The absolute difference is `abs(1 - (-1)) = abs(2) = 2`.
2. The second pair is `(2, 2)`. The absolute difference is `abs(2 - 2) = abs(0) = 0`.
3. The third pair is `(3, 3)`. The absolute difference is `abs(3 - 3) = abs(0) = 0`.
4. The fourth pair is `(5, 4)`. The absolute difference is `abs(5 - 4) = abs(1) = 1`.

Thus, the resulting list of absolute differences is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.
