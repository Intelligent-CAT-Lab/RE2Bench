Let's walk through the execution of the `as_content_primitive` function step by step based on the provided input.

1. **Function Call**: The function `as_content_primitive` is called on an instance of `Expr` with `self` having `nargs="{1}"`. The arguments passed are `radical=False` and `clear=False`.

2. **Method Body**: The function is defined as:
   ```python
   def as_content_primitive(self, radical=False, clear=True):
       return (S.One, self)
   ```

3. **Arguments**: Inside the function, the arguments `radical` and `clear` are evaluated. Here, `radical` is `False`, and `clear` is `False`.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns a tuple `(S.One, self)`. Since `self` refers to the instance of `Expr` (with `nargs="{1}"`), the result is a tuple where the first element is `S.One` (which is `1` or the number one) and the second element is the `Expr` instance itself.

5. **Output Construction**: The output is expected to be a dictionary with a single key `"output"` and the returned tuple as its value.

Therefore, the output of the function will be a dictionary where the value of `"output"` is the tuple `(1, {1})`.
