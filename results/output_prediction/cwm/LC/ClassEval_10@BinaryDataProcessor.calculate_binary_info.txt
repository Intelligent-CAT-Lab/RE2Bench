Let's go through the function step by step:

1. The binary string is "0110100001100101011011000110110001101111"
2. zeroes_count = count of '0's in the string
3. ones_count = count of '1's in the string
4. total_length = length of the string
5. zeroes_percentage = zeroes_count / total_length
6. ones_percentage = ones_count / total_length

Now, let's count:
- Number of '0's: Let's count them:
  0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
  Zeroes: 0 appears at positions 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 33
  That's 18 zeros.

- Number of '1's: Total length is 40, so ones_count = 40 - 18 = 22.

- total_length = 40
- zeroes_percentage = 18/40 = 0.45
- ones_percentage = 22/40 = 0.55

So the output should be:
{"Zeroes": 0.45, "Ones": 0.55, "Bit length": 40}
</think>
[OUTPUT]
{
    "Zeroes": 0.45,
    "Ones": 0.55,
    "Bit length": 40
}
