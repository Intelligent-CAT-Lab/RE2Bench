1. x is the class 'sympy.core.numbers.ImaginaryUnit', and y is the class 'sympy.core.numbers.Pi'.
2. The function compares their names. Since they are different, it checks if y is a subclass of Basic.
3. Assuming both classes are subclasses of Basic, it attempts to find their indices in ordering_of_classes.
4. If both classes are found in ordering_of_classes, it compares their indices and returns the difference.
5. If one or both classes are not found, it uses a default value (UNKNOWN) and compares accordingly.
6. The exact output depends on the ordering_of_classes list, which is not provided. However, based on the function's logic, the output will be an integer representing the comparison result.
