1. The function `setup` takes `app` as an argument of type `Sphinx`.
2. It calls `app.add_transform` five times with different transform classes, each time registering a transform in the Sphinx application.
3. Each call to `add_transform` adds the provided transform class to the list of transforms that Sphinx will apply during document parsing.
4. After registering all transforms, the function returns a dictionary containing metadata about the extension, specifically the version and safety flags for parallel reading and writing.
5. The returned dictionary has three key-value pairs: 
   - "version": 'builtin'
   - "parallel_read_safe": True
   - "parallel_write_safe": True

{
    "version": "builtin",
