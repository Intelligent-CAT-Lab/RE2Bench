Step 1: The function `_eval_is_real` is called on an instance of the `asec` class. The `args` attribute of this instance is empty.

Step 2: The function tries to access the first argument (`self.args[0]`), but since `self.args` is empty, an `ArgumentIndexError` is expected.

Step 3: The error occurs because the function assumes that there is at least one argument provided to the `asec` function. Without an argument, it cannot evaluate the expression.

Step 4: The function is supposed to determine if the inverse secant of the argument is real. However, without an argument, this evaluation is impossible, and the function likely returns `None` or raises an error indicating that no argument was provided.

Step 5: Given the structure of the expected output and the fact that no argument is provided, the output is expected to be `None`.
