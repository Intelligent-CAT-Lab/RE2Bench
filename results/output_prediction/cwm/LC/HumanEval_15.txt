The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` and returns a string where numbers from 0 to `n` are joined by spaces. 

Given the input `n = 10`, we first generate a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 10 inclusive. This list is `["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"]`.

We then join these elements into a single string separated by spaces. The result is the string `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
