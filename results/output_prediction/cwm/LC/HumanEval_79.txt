Let's go through the function step by step to determine the output.

The function `decimal_to_binary` takes a single argument `decimal`. It converts this decimal number to its binary representation using Python's built-in `bin()` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The function then strips off the '0b' prefix by slicing the string starting from index 2 (`[2:]`).

In this case, the input is `decimal = 0`. Let's see what happens:

1. `bin(0)` returns the string `'0b0'`.
2. Slicing `[2:]` removes the first two characters (`'0b'`), leaving `'0'`.
3. The function then concatenates `'db'` at the beginning and end of this result, resulting in `'db' + '0' + 'db'`, which equals `'db0db'`.

Therefore, the output of the function when given `decimal = 0` is `'db0db'`.
