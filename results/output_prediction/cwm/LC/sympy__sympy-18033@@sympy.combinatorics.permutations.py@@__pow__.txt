Step 1: Inside `__pow__`, the function checks if `n` is an instance of Permutation. Since `n` is an integer, this condition is skipped.
Step 2: Convert `n` to an integer, which is already the case here (`n` = -2).
Step 3: Call `_af_pow` with `self.array_form` and `n`. However, since `self._array_form` is None, we need to infer its value based on the context or additional information not provided in the input. Assuming `self._array_form` represents the permutation in array form, and given that the size of the permutation is 7, let's consider a hypothetical permutation. For simplicity, let's assume `self._array_form` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0], representing a permutation where each element is shifted one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to the first position.
Step 4: Compute the power of the permutation. Raising a permutation to a negative power is equivalent to finding its inverse and then raising it to the absolute value of the power. The inverse of a permutation is obtained by swapping the elements in the array form. So, the inverse of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0] is [6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Raising this inverse to the power of 2 (since the absolute value of -2 is 2) involves applying the permutation twice. Applying [6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] twice results in [5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
Step 5: The result of `_af_pow` is [5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which becomes the new `_array_form` of the permutation.
Step 6: The size of the permutation remains 7.
