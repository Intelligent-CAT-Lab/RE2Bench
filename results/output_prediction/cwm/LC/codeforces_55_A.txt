Let's break down the execution step by step.

The input given is 9. The first line reads the input and converts it into an integer, so n = 9.

Next, the while loop checks if n is divisible by 2. Since 9 is not divisible by 2, the loop does not execute.

Now, the code checks if n equals 1. Since n is 9, the condition is false, so the else block is executed. The output is printed as 'NO'.
