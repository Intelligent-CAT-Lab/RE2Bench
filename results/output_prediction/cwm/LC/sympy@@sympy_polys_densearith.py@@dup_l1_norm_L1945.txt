1. The function `dup_l1_norm` is called with arguments `f = [1, 2]` and `K = ZZ`. Since `f` is non-empty, the function proceeds to calculate the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients in `f` using `K.sum(dup_abs(f, K))`.
2. The `dup_abs` function is invoked with `f = [1, 2]` and `K = ZZ`. It returns a new list where each coefficient is replaced by its absolute value. Since both coefficients are already non-negative, the result is `[1, 2]`.
3. The `sum` method of the domain `ZZ` is then called with the list `[1, 2]`. This method computes the sum of the elements in the list, starting from `self.zero` (which is 0 for the integer domain). The sum of 1 and 2 is 3.
4. The final result returned by `dup_l1_norm` is therefore 3.
