Let's analyze the function call `gf_rem` with the given inputs.

1. The function `gf_rem` calls `gf_div` with the same arguments, so we need to understand what `gf_div` does.

2. `gf_div` performs division with remainder in GF(p)[x]. The inputs are:
   - `f = [2, 0]` (polynomial 2x + 0)
   - `g = [1, 0, 1]` (polynomial x^2 + 0x + 1)
   - `p = 3` (GF(3))
   - `K = "ZZ"` (integer domain, but used for inversion in GF(3))

3. Inside `gf_div`:
   - `df = gf_degree(f) = 1` (degree of f)
   - `dg = gf_degree(g) = 2` (degree of g)
   - Since `df < dg`, the function returns `([], f)`.

4. Therefore, `gf_div` returns `([], [2, 0])`, which means the remainder is `[2, 0]`.

5. `gf_rem` returns the second element of the tuple returned by `gf_div`, which is `[2, 0]`.
