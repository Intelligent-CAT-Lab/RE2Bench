Let's go through the function step by step.

1. The function starts by creating a copy of the input array `[1, 2, 1]`. This results in `new_array = [1, 2, 1]`.
2. The function then reverses `new_array`, resulting in a reversed iterator object. The reversed array would logically be `[1, 2, 1]` (since the original array is a palindrome).
3. The list comprehension `[x * x for x in new_array]` squares each element in the reversed array. This results in `[1 * 1, 2 * 2, 1 * 1]` which is `[1, 4, 1]`.
