Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. The input is `"1 0 1"`, which is passed to the `input()` function. This string is then split into three parts using `split()`, resulting in the list `["1", "0", "1"]`. These are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`, assigning `N = 1`, `A = 0`, and `B = 1`.

2. The variable `ans` is calculated as `N // (A + B) * A`. Here, `A + B` equals `0 + 1 = 1`, and `N // (A + B)` is `1 // 1 = 1`. Multiplying this by `A` (which is `0`) gives `ans = 0`.

3. The remainder `rem` is calculated as `N % (A + B)`, which is `1 % 1 = 0`.

4. The line `ans += min(rem, A)` adds the minimum of `rem` (which is `0`) and `A` (which is `0`) to `ans`. Since both are `0`, `ans` remains `0`.

5. Finally, `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`, which is `0`.
