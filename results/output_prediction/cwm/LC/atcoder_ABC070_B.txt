Let's go through the code step by step.

1. The code reads input from the console. The input is `"0 33 66 99"`. It is split into parts using the split() method and then each part is converted to an integer. Thus, the variables are assigned as follows:
   a = 0, b = 33, c = 66, d = 99

2. The code calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between the minimum of b and d, and the maximum of a and c. 
   - The minimum of b (33) and d (99) is 33.
   - The maximum of a (0) and c (66) is 66.
   - The difference between these two values is 33 - 66 = -33.
   - The maximum of 0 and -33 is 0.

So, the output will be 0.
