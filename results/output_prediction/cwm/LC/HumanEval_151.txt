The function `double_the_difference` takes a list as input and calculates the sum of squares of all elements that meet specific conditions. Let's break it down:

1. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the input list `lst`.
2. For each element `i`, it checks three conditions:
   - `i > 0`: The element must be greater than zero.
   - `i % 2 != 0`: The element must be an odd number (since even numbers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).
   - `'.' not in str(i)`: The element, when converted to a string, must not contain a decimal point (this ensures it's an integer and not a float).

3. If an element satisfies all these conditions, its square (`i ** 2`) is added to the list.
4. Finally, the `sum()` function adds up all the squared values in the resulting list.

Now, let's apply this logic to the provided input:

Input list `lst` is empty (`[]`). Since there are no elements in the list, the list comprehension will not process any elements. As a result, the sum of an empty list is 0.
