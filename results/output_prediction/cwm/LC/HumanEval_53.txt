Let's analyze the function `add(x: int, y: int)` and the given input step by step.

The function `add` takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.

Given the input:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "x": 852,
        "y": 371
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
- `self` is an empty dictionary and seems irrelevant for this function since it's not used within `add`.
- The `args` dictionary contains the values for `x` and `y`, which are 852 and 371, respectively.
- `kwargs` is empty, meaning there are no additional keyword arguments to process.

Now, simulating the execution of the `add` function:
1. The function is called with `x = 852` and `y = 371`.
2. The function returns the result of `x + y`, which is `852 + 371`.

Calculating `852 + 371`:
- 852 + 300 = 1152
- 1152 + 70 = 1222
- 1222 + 1 = 1223

So, the result of the function call is 1223.
