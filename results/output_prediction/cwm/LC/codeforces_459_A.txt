Let's go through the execution step by step.

1. The first line reads the input and splits it into four integers: anti, b, c, d.
   Input is "3 4 7 8", so anti=3, b=4, c=7, d=8.

2. Calculate l = abs(anti - c) = abs(3 - 7) = 4.

3. Calculate m = abs(b - d) = abs(4 - 8) = 4.

4. Check if anti == c: 3 == 7 is False, so skip this block.

5. Check if b == d: 4 == 8 is False, so skip this block.

6. Check if l != m: 4 != 4 is False, so skip this block.

7. Since none of the above conditions are met, execute the else block:
   print(anti, d, c, b) = print(3, 8, 7, 4).
