Okay, let's break down the code step by step. The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input.

1. The first line assigns `count` to the length of `nums`. In this case, `nums` has 5 elements: [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2], so `count` is 5.

2. The loop is `for num in range(2, count):`. The `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value. So `range(2, 5)` will generate the numbers 2, 3, 4. This means the loop will execute three times.

3. Inside the loop, the code sorts the list `nums` using `nums.sort()`. 

Now, let's consider the initial state of `nums`: [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]. 

- On the first iteration (when `num` is 2), the list is sorted. Since it's already in ascending order, nothing changes. The list remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
- On the second iteration (when `num` is 3), the list is sorted again. Still, it remains [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
- On the third iteration (when `num` is 4), the list is sorted once more. Again, no change occurs.

So after all iterations, the list is still [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].

The function then returns this sorted list.
