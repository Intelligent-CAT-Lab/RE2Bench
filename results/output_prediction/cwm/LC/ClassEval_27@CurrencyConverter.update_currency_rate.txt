Step 1: Examine the input parameters for the update_currency_rate method.
The input parameters are:
- self: an instance of CurrencyConverter with a rates dictionary that includes the currency 'CNY' mapped to 7.18.
- currency: 'CNY'
- new_rate: 7.18

Step 2: Check if the given currency (CNY) is present in the self.rates dictionary.
In this case, 'CNY' is indeed a key in self.rates, with a value of 7.18.

Step 3: Since the currency exists, update the rate of 'CNY' in self.rates to the new_rate value, which is also 7.18.
After the update, the rate for 'CNY' remains 7.18, so there is no actual change, but the method still executes successfully.

Step 4: Determine the output of the method.
The update_currency_rate method does not explicitly return a value when the update is successful. In Python, if no return statement is encountered, the method returns None by default.

Therefore, the output of the update_currency_rate method will be None.
