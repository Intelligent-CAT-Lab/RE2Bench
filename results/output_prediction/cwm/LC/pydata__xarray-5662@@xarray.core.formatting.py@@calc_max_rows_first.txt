1. The function `calc_max_rows_first` is called with the input `max_rows` set to 12.
2. Inside the function, the calculation `max_rows // 2 + max_rows % 2` is performed.
3. Since `max_rows` is 12, the integer division `12 // 2` equals 6, and the modulus `12 % 2` equals 0.
4. Adding these two results together, 6 + 0 = 6.
