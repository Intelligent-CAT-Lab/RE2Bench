The function _eval_expand_trig is a method of the class ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction. Since _eval_expand_trig calls self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig', **hints), and the input does not specify any additional hints, the function will return the result of self._calculate_reciprocal('_eval_expand_trig').

However, the _calculate_reciprocal method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact output. But we can infer that it will return a value related to the reciprocal hyperbolic function.

Given the input, the output structure is {"nargs": {"_args_set": XXX}}. The value of _args_set in the output should be the same as in the input, which is "{'1'}".
