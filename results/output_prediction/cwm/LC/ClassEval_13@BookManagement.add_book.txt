<think>
The function `add_book` is called with `title="book2"` and the default `quantity=1`. 

1. The code checks if "book2" is already in `self.inventory`. Since `self.inventory` has "book2" with a value of 1, it will proceed to update the quantity.
2. It increments `self.inventory["book2"]` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2.
3. No return value is explicitly specified in the function, so the output will be `None`.
