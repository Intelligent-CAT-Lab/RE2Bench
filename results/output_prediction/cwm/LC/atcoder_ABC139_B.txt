Okay, let's see. The problem is to predict the output of a Python program given a specific input. The code provided is:

t, h = map(int, input().split())
print((h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1)

And the input is:

{
    "input": "\"8 9\""
}

First, I need to understand what the code does. The first line reads two integers from the input, separated by a space. The second line calculates and prints the result of the expression (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. The input is "8 9". When we split it using split(), we get ["8", "9"], and map(int, ...) converts them to integers 8 and 9. So t = 8 and h = 9.

2. Now compute (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1:
   - h - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   - t - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
   - 7 // 7 = 1 (since integer division in Python truncates towards negative infinity, but here both numbers are positive, so it's straightforward)
   - 1 + 1 = 2

So the output should be 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I miss any part of the code? The code is straightforward: read two integers, compute that expression, print the result. The input is correctly parsed, and the calculation seems right. Hmm, yes, that's correct. So the output is 2.
