Okay, let's break down the execution step by step.

The function `_is_decade` takes in three arguments: `x`, `base`, and `rtol`. In this case, `x` is 1e-07 (which is 0.0000001), `base` is 10, and `rtol` is 1e-07.

First, the function checks if `x` is finite using `np.isfinite(x)`. Since 1e-07 is a finite number, this condition passes (returns True), so we don't return False here.

Next, it checks if `x` is exactly 0.0. Since 1e-07 is not zero, this condition is also not met, so we proceed.

Now, we compute `lx = np.log(abs(x)) / np.log(base)`. 

Let's calculate this:
- `abs(x)` is 1e-07.
- `np.log(1e-07)` is the natural logarithm of 1e-07. Since 1e-07 = 10^(-7), the natural log is ln(10^(-7)) = -7 * ln(10) ≈ -7 * 2.302585093 ≈ -16.11809565.
- `np.log(base)` is ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093.
- So, `lx` becomes (-16.11809565) / (2.302585093) ≈ -7.0.

The next step checks if `rtol` is None. Since `rtol` is provided as 1e-07, we use the else clause and call `np.isclose(lx, np.round(lx), rtol=rtol)`.

Here, `lx` is approximately -7.0, and `np.round(lx)` is exactly -7.0. The `np.isclose` function checks if these two values are close within the relative tolerance `rtol=1e-07`.

Since `-7.0` and `-7.0` are exactly equal, their relative difference is zero, which is certainly within the tolerance of 1e-07. Therefore, `np.isclose` returns True.

So, the final output of the function should be True.
