Let's analyze the code step by step. The function `construct_stop_word_list` is defined within the class `NLPDataProcessor`. 

1. The function starts by creating a variable named `stop_word_list` and assigning it a list containing the elements `'a'`, `'an'`, and `'the'`.

2. The next step is for the function to return this list through the `return` statement.

Since the function has no parameters and does not perform any operations that rely on external inputs (such as `self`, `args`, or `kwargs`), the input provided does not affect the function's outcome. The function will always return the list `['a', 'an', 'the']` regardless of the input.

Therefore, the output of the function will be the list `['a', 'an', 'the']`.
