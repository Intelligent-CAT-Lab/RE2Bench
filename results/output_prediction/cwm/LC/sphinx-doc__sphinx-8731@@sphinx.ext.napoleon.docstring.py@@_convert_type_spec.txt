Step 1: The function `_convert_type_spec` is called with arguments `_type` set to `"str"` and `translations` as an empty dictionary.

Step 2: Inside the function, it first checks if `_type` is in the `translations` dictionary. Since the dictionary is empty, this condition is not met.

Step 3: It then checks if `_type` equals `"None"`. In this case, `_type` is `"str"`, so this condition is also not met.

Step 4: The function proceeds to the else clause, where it returns the string `':class:`%s`' % _type`. Here, `_type` is `"str"`, so it returns `':class:`str`'`.

Step 5: The return statement effectively ends the function execution.
