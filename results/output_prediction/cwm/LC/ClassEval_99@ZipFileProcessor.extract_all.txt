Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. The function `extract_all` is called on an instance of `ZipFileProcessor`, where `self.file_name` is an empty string (`""`).

2. Inside `extract_all`, the code enters a try block and attempts to open a ZIP file using `zipfile.ZipFile(self.file_name, 'r')`. Here, `self.file_name` is an empty string, so this will raise an exception.

3. Because opening the ZIP file fails (due to an invalid file name), the `with` block is never entered, and no extraction happens.

4. The code then jumps to the `except` block, which catches the exception and returns `False`.

So, the final output of the `extract_all` function will be `False`.
