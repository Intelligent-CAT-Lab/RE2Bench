Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The `subtract` method is called with two arguments, `c1` and `c2`. These arguments are passed as strings: `c1 = "(-1+2j)"` and `c2 = "(-3+4j)"`.

2. The `subtract` method converts these strings into complex numbers using the `complex()` constructor. So, `c1` becomes `complex(-1, 2)` and `c2` becomes `complex(-3, 4)`.

3. The real part of the result is calculated as `c1.real - c2.real`. Since `c1.real` is `-1` and `c2.real` is `-3`, the real part of the result is `2`.

4. The imaginary part of the result is calculated as `c1.imag - c2.imag`. Since `c1.imag` is `2` and `c2.imag` is `4`, the imaginary part of the result is `-2`.

5. A new complex number is returned with these calculated real and imaginary parts: `complex(2, -2)`.

So, the result of the `subtract` method will be a complex number with real part `2` and imaginary part `-2`.
