Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The code reads input from the console, which is "3447 629". It uses `map(int, input().split())` to split the input by whitespace and convert each part into an integer. This sets `h = 3447` and `a = 629`.

2. The code computes `math.ceil(h / a)`, which is `math.ceil(3447 / 629)`. First, `3447 / 629` equals 5.4838..., and `math.ceil()` rounds it up to the nearest integer, resulting in 6.

3. The program prints the result, which is 6.
