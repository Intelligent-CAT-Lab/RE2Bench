Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input is a list: [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]. The function `f` takes this list as an argument named `num`.
2. The first line inside the function is `num.append(num[-1])`. This appends the last element of the list to the end of the list. The last element of the list is `1`, so after this line, the list becomes [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1].
3. The function then returns the modified list.

So, the output of the function will be the list [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1, 1].
