Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to determine the output of the `precision_recall_curve` function given the provided input.

1. **Input Parameters**:
    - `y_true`: null
    - `probas_pred`: null
    - `pos_label`: 1
    - `sample_weight`: null

2. **Function Call**:
    The function `precision_recall_curve` is called with the above parameters.

3. **Execution Flow**:
    - The function first calls `_binary_clf_curve(y_true, probas_pred, pos_label=pos_label, sample_weight=sample_weight)`. This is where most of the work happens.
    - Inside `_binary_clf_curve`, there are several checks and transformations:
        - `check_consistent_length` ensures all input arrays have the same length.
        - `column_or_1d` converts `y_true` and `probas_pred` into 1D arrays.
        - `assert_all_finite` checks for infinite values in the inputs.
        - The function then processes the inputs to compute true positives (tps), false positives (fps), and thresholds.

4. **Handling Null Inputs**:
    - Since `y_true` and `probas_pred` are null, the function will encounter errors when trying to process these inputs. Specifically, `column_or_1d` will fail because it cannot handle null inputs.

5. **Error Prediction**:
    - The error will likely be a `ValueError` because the function expects array-like inputs for `y_true` and `probas_pred`, but null is provided instead.

6. **Output Structure**:
    - The output structure is defined as `{"output": XXX}`, where XXX is the predicted output.

Given the above reasoning, the function will raise an error due to the null inputs. However, since the problem asks for the output structure and not the error message, we need to consider what the function would return if it successfully executed. But in this case, it's not possible to compute a valid output due to the null inputs.

However, the problem might be expecting us to assume that the null inputs are placeholders for valid data and predict the structure of the output. In that case, the output would be a dictionary with a "precision_recall" key containing arrays for precision, recall, and thresholds.

But strictly following the instructions and considering the null inputs, the function will not execute successfully. Since we need to provide an output in the specified structure, and assuming that the null inputs are a mistake and the function should still return the expected output structure, we proceed with the predicted output structure.
