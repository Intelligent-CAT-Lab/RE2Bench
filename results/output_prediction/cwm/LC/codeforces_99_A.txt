Okay, let's go through this code step by step with the input "2.4". 

First, the code reads the input using `input()` and splits it by the period '.' character. This will result in a list `num` with two elements: `['2', '4']`.

Next, the code checks if the last character of the first element (num[0][-1]) converted to an integer is equal to 9. Since the last character of '2' is '2', which is not 9, this condition is false, so it moves to the next condition.

The next condition checks if the first character of the second element (num[1][0]) converted to an integer is greater than or equal to 5. The first character of '4' is '4', which is less than 5. So this condition is also false.

Therefore, the code will execute the else block, which prints `num[0]`. Since `num[0]` is '2', the output will be '2'.
