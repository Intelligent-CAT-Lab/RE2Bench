I will now analyze the function step by step to predict the output.

1. The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` as an argument. The input dictionary is `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.
2. The line `d = d.copy()` creates a shallow copy of the dictionary `d`. This means that the new `d` is a separate dictionary with the same key-value pairs, but it is not linked to the original dictionary.
3. The line `d.popitem()` removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary `d`. Since dictionaries in Python (versions 3.7 and above) maintain insertion order, the last inserted key is "x:" with the value 3. After this operation, the dictionary `d` becomes `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
4. The function returns the modified dictionary `d`.

So, the final output should be a dictionary with keys "l" and "t", and their respective values 1 and 2.

{
    "l": 1,
    "t": 2
