Let's walk through the execution step by step.

1. The `add_item` method is called with the parameters:
   - `item_name = "Coke"`
   - `price = 1.25`
   - `quantity = 10`

2. Inside the `add_item` method, the code checks the result of calling `restock_item(item_name, quantity)`:
   - It calls `restock_item("Coke", 10)`.

3. In the `restock_item` method:
   - It checks if `"Coke"` is already in the `inventory`. It is.
   - It increments the quantity of `"Coke"` by 10: `20 + 10 = 30`.
   - It returns `True` to indicate the item was successfully restocked.

4. Back in the `add_item` method:
   - Since `restock_item` returned `True`, the `if not restock_item(...)` condition is `False`.
   - Therefore, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
   - The method ends without adding a new item to the inventory or modifying anything else.

So, the `add_item` method effectively restocks `"Coke"` by 10 units but does not add any new item. The inventory now has 30 units of `"Coke"`.

The output of the `add_item` method is `None` since it does not return any value.
