The code starts by importing the sys module, although it is not used in the given snippet. The main function is defined, and when the script is run directly, the main function is called.

Inside the main function, the code reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers. These integers are assigned to the variables S and W, respectively. The input provided is "74 74", so S and W both get the value 74.

The code then evaluates the condition `S <= W`. Since both S and W are 74, the condition is true. As a result, the code executes the print statement for 'unsafe'.

The final output of the program is 'unsafe'.
