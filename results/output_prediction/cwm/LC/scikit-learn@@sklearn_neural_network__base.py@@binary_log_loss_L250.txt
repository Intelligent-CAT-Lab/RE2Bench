The binary_log_loss function calculates the binary logarithmic loss between two arrays: y_true (the true labels) and y_prob (the predicted probabilities). The function first clips the probabilities to ensure they are within the valid range (epsilon to 1-epsilon) to prevent numerical issues. Then, it computes the loss using the formula -average(xlogy(y_true, y_prob) + xlogy(1 - y_true, 1 - y_prob)).

Step 1: The function receives y_true and y_prob as input arrays. y_true is a 2D boolean array, and y_prob is a 2D array of floats representing probabilities.

Step 2: The function clips y_prob to ensure all values are within the range [epsilon, 1-epsilon], where epsilon is the smallest representable float for the data type of y_prob.

Step 3: The function calculates the logarithmic loss for each element in the arrays using the formula xlogy(y_true, y_prob) + xlogy(1 - y_true, 1 - y_prob). This formula computes the loss for each class (True and False) and sums them up.

Step 4: The function takes the average of these losses, weighted by sample_weight if provided. Since sample_weight is None in this case, it computes the unweighted average.

Step 5: Finally, the function returns the negative of this average loss, as the loss function is typically defined as the negative log-likelihood.

Given the provided inputs, the function will compute the binary logarithmic loss for the given true labels and predicted probabilities. The exact numerical output will depend on the specific values in y_true and y_prob, but the process follows the steps outlined above.
