Let's break down the code and simulate the execution step by step.

The input provides two complex numbers as strings:
- c1: "-1-2j"
- c2: "-3-4j"

We need to evaluate the `multiply` method with these two complex numbers.

Step-by-step simulation:

1. The `multiply` method takes two arguments, c1 and c2.
2. The code initializes `real` using the formula: 
   real = c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag
   Substituting the values:
   real = (-1) * (-3) - (-2) * (-4)
       = 3 - 8
       = -5
3. The code initializes `imaginary` using the formula:
   imaginary = c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real
   Substituting the values:
   imaginary = (-1) * (-4) + (-2) * (-3)
         = 4 + 6
         = 10
4. The method returns a complex number constructed with real and imaginary values: complex(real, imaginary).
   This results in a complex number (-5+10j).

Therefore, the output of the `multiply` method should be (-5+10j).
