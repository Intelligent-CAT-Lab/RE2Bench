1. We are in the `__mul__` method of the `QuarterOffset` class.
2. The method takes `self` (an instance of `QuarterOffset`) and an `other` argument.
3. In the input, `self` has attributes `n=1` and `month=2`, and `other` is `-1`.
4. The method checks if `other` is a float, but since `other` is `-1` (an integer), the condition is skipped.
5. Then, it returns a new instance of `QuarterOffset` with:
   - `n` calculated as `other * self.n`, which is `-1 * 1 = -1`.
   - `month` remains the same as `self.month`, which is `2`.
6. Therefore, the resulting object should have `n=-1` and `month=2`.
