Okay, let's see. The problem is about executing the `split` method of the `RegexUtils` class. The input gives a pattern and a text, and we need to use the `re.split` function to split the text based on the pattern.

First, let me understand the pattern. The pattern is `\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b`. Breaking it down:

- `\b` is a word boundary, ensuring the match is a standalone phone number and not part of a larger number.
- `\d{3}` matches exactly three digits.
- `-` matches a literal hyphen.
- The pattern repeats for another three digits and four digits, making a total of 10 digits with hyphens in between.

So the pattern is looking for phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Now the text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767".

Applying `re.split`, this function will split the text wherever the pattern matches. The result will be a list of substrings that are separated by the matched phone numbers.

Let's test this step by step:

1. The first part of the text is "123-456-7890". Since this matches the pattern, it will be used as a separator. The text before it is an empty string (start of string), so the first element is an empty string.
2. The next part is " abiguygusu " (assuming there's a space after the phone number and before the next part). Wait, actually, looking at the input text, after "123-456-7890" there's a space, then "abiguygusu", another space, then "876-286-9876", etc. So splitting on the phone numbers would split the text into parts that are between the phone numbers.

Wait, let me parse the text correctly. The text is:

"123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

So the phone numbers are at the start, then after "abiguygusu", then after "kjgufwycs".

So splitting on the phone numbers would result in:

- The part before the first phone number: empty string (since it starts with the phone number).
- The part between first and second phone number: " abiguygusu " (with spaces? Wait, the actual text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876...". So between "123-456-7890" and "876-286-9876" is " abiguygusu " (space, abiguygusu, space).
- The part between second and third phone number: " kjgufwycs " (space, kjgufwycs, space).
- The part after the third phone number: empty string (since it ends with the phone number).

But wait, the `re.split` function will split the string into parts wherever the pattern occurs. So the resulting list will be:

['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']

But wait, let me check again. Let's take the example text:

Original text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

Split on the phone numbers:

- The first split is at "123-456-7890", so the first element is the part before it, which is empty.
- The next part is " abiguygusu " (space, abiguygusu, space).
- Then comes "876-286-9876", so the next element is " abiguygusu " (but wait, no—the split would be between the first and second phone number. Wait, the text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767". So after the first phone number, the next part is " abiguygusu " (space, abiguygusu, space), then the second phone number "876-286-9876", then " kjgufwycs " (space, kjgufwycs, space), then the third phone number "987-762-9767", and then nothing after.

So splitting on the phone numbers would give:

['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']

But wait, let's test this with actual code. For example, if we have the string "aXbXc" and split on "X", we get ['a', 'b', 'c']. Similarly, if the string starts with "X", the first element is empty. If it ends with "X", the last element is empty.

In our case, the text starts with a phone number, so the first element is empty. Then between the first and second phone number is " abiguygusu ", then between second and third is " kjgufwycs ", and after the third phone number is empty.

So the output list should be ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', ''].

But wait, let me check the actual spaces. The original text is "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767". So after "123-456-7890" there's a space, then "abiguygusu", then a space, then "876-286-9876", etc. So the parts between the phone numbers are " abiguygusu " (with spaces on both ends) and " kjgufwycs " (also with spaces). However, when splitting, the split occurs at the phone numbers, so the parts between them include the spaces around the phone numbers.

Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the string is "abc123def456ghi". Splitting on "123" and "456" would give ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']. But in our case, the phone numbers are separated by spaces. Let's see:

Original text: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

Split on the phone numbers:

- The first phone number is at the start. The part before is empty.
- The part after the first phone number and before the second is " abiguygusu " (space, abiguygusu, space).
- The part after the second phone number and before the third is " kjgufwycs " (space, kjgufwycs, space).
- The part after the third phone number is empty.

So the split result is ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', ''].

But wait, when you split a string like "aXbXc" on "X", you get ['a', 'b', 'c']. So in our case, the phone numbers are the separators, and the parts between them are the elements of the list.

But in the given text, the phone numbers are followed by spaces. For example, "123-456-7890 " (with a space), then "abiguygusu ", then "876-286-9876 ", etc. Wait, no. Let me look again.

The text is: "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"

Breaking it down:

- "123-456-7890" is the first phone number.
- Then a space.
- Then "abiguygusu".
- Then a space.
- Then "876-286-9876" (second phone number).
- Then a space.
- Then "kjgufwycs".
- Then a space.
- Then "987-762-9767" (third phone number).

So the parts between the phone numbers are:

- Between first and second phone number: " abiguygusu " (space, abiguygusu, space).
- Between second and third phone number: " kjgufwycs " (space, kjgufwycs, space).

So the split would result in:

['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']

But wait, the split function includes the parts before the first match, between matches, and after the last match. Since the first match is at the start, the first element is empty. The last match is at the end, so the last element is empty.

Therefore, the output should be a list with four elements: ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', ''].

But let me check with a simple example. Suppose the text is "123-456-7890abc876-286-9876def987-762-9767". Splitting on the phone numbers would give ['', 'abc', 'def', ''].

In our case, the text has spaces around the non-phone number parts, so the split would include those spaces in the resulting list elements.

Therefore, the output of the `split` method should be ['', ' abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', ''].
