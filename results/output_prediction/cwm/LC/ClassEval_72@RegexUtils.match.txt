Let's simulate the execution of the `match` method.

1. `pattern` is set to `"\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"` and `text` is `"iustd87t2euhifg.com"`.

2. The `re.match(pattern, text)` function is called. This function checks for a match at the beginning of the string `text` according to the regular expression pattern.

3. The pattern in question appears to be an email validation regex pattern. However, upon closer inspection, it seems to be checking for an email address. The `text` provided, `"iustd87t2euhifg.com"`, resembles a domain name rather than a complete email address (which typically has the format localpart@domain).

4. Since `re.match()` only searches from the start of the string, and the pattern expects an email format (with an "@" symbol), the match will fail because `"iustd87t2euhifg.com"` does not contain an "@" symbol and thus doesn't match the expected email pattern.

5. As a result, `ans` will be `None`, and the function will return `False`.
