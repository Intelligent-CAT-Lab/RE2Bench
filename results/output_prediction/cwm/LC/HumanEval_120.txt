Let's walk through the function step by step.

1. The function is called with `arr = [-4, 4]` and `k = 2`. Since `k` is not zero, we skip the `if k == 0` condition.
2. Next, `arr.sort()` is executed. This sorts the list `arr` in-place. After sorting, `arr` becomes `[-4, 4]` (it remains the same because it's already sorted).
3. Then, `ans = arr[-k:]` is evaluated. The value of `k` is 2, so `arr[-2:]` returns the last 2 elements of the sorted array. Since `arr` is `[-4, 4]`, the last 2 elements are `[-4, 4]`. Thus, `ans` becomes `[-4, 4]`.
4. Finally, the function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, 4]`.
