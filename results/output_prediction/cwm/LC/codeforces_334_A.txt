Let's analyze the code step by step.

The input is 8, which is read by the first line `n = int(input())`. This assigns `n` the value 8. 

Then, `i` and `j` are initialized as `i = 1` and `j = n * n = 8 * 8 = 64`.

The loop condition `while i < j:` is true initially since `1 < 64`. 

Inside the loop:
1. The current values of `i` and `j` are printed.
2. `i` is incremented by 1.
3. `j` is decremented by 1.

This process continues until `i` is no longer less than `j`.

So, the loop will run as follows:
- First iteration: i=1, j=64 → print 1 64 → i becomes 2, j becomes 63
- Second iteration: i=2, j=63 → print 2 63 → i becomes 3, j becomes 62
- ...
- The loop will continue until i and j meet in the middle.

Since n is 8, the number of iterations will be until i reaches the middle value. The loop will stop when i is no longer less than j, which happens when i = j or i > j.

In this case, the loop will run 31 times (since 64 / 2 = 32, but we stop when i < j, so it's 31 iterations). However, the exact number of iterations isn't crucial for understanding the output structure.

The output will consist of pairs of numbers starting from 1 and 64, incrementing the first and decrementing the second in each line, until they meet or cross.
