1. The function `sstr` is called with arguments `expr` and `settings`. 
2. `expr` is a permutation with an array form of `null` and size `6`. 
3. The function `sstr` creates a `StrPrinter` object `p` with the given `settings`.
4. Then it calls the `doprint` method of `p` with `expr` as the argument and assigns the result to `s`.
5. Finally, it returns `s`.

Now, let's analyze how the `StrPrinter` class and its methods work.
6. The `StrPrinter` class has a method `doprint` which calls `_print` method.
7. The `_print` method checks the type of `expr` and calls the appropriate printing method based on its type.
8. Since `expr` is a permutation, it will call `_print_Permutation` method.
9. In `_print_Permutation` method, it checks if the permutation is cyclic and prints it accordingly.
10. If the permutation is not cyclic, it prints the permutation in the form `Permutation([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=6)`.

Based on the above analysis, the output of `sstr` function will be `Permutation([], size=6)`.
