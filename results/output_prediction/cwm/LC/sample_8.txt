I will simulate the execution of the function step by step.
1. The function is called with the arguments `string="UppEr"` and `encryption=0`.
2. The first line of the function checks if `encryption == 0`. Since the value of `encryption` is 0, this condition is true.
3. The function returns the value of `string` directly, which is "UppEr".
4. The return value will be "UppEr".

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "UppEr"        
}
