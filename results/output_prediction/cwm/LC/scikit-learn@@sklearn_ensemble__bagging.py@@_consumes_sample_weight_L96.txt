The function `_consumes_sample_weight` checks if the estimator's `fit` method consumes the `sample_weight` parameter. The process involves checking if routing is enabled and then using either the `get_routing_for_object` function or the `has_fit_parameter` function to determine this.

1. The function starts by checking if routing is enabled using `_routing_enabled()`. Since the default configuration typically has this disabled, it likely returns `False`.
2. Because routing is not enabled, the function uses `has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight')` to check if the estimator's `fit` method includes `sample_weight` as a parameter.
3. The `has_fit_parameter` function checks if the estimator has a `fit` method and if `sample_weight` is in the parameters of that method.
4. For `KNeighborsClassifier()`, the `fit` method does include `sample_weight` as a parameter, so `has_fit_parameter` returns `True`.
5. Therefore, `_consumes_sample_weight` returns `True`, indicating that the estimator consumes `sample_weight`.
