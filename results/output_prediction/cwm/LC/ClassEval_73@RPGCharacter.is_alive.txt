I am given a Python class `RPGCharacter` with an `is_alive` method. Let me break down the code and run it step by step.

The code starts by defining the `RPGCharacter` class. Within this class, the `__init__` method initializes several attributes for the character: `name`, `hp` (hit points), `attack_power`, `defense`, `level` (defaulting to 1 if not provided), and `exp` (experience, starting at 0). 

The `is_alive` method checks if the character's `hp` is greater than 0. If it is, the character is considered alive; otherwise, they are not.

Now, let's look at the input provided:
- `self` has the attributes: `name="John"`, `hp=100`, `attack_power=20`, `defense=10`, `level=1`, and `exp=0`.
- No arguments (`args`) or keyword arguments (`kwargs`) are provided for the `is_alive` method.

To predict the output, I'll simulate the execution:
1. The `is_alive` method is called.
2. Inside `is_alive`, it checks `self.hp > 0`. Since `self.hp` is 100, this condition evaluates to `True`.
3. The method returns `True`, indicating the character is alive.

Therefore, the output should be a JSON object with `"output": true`.
