Let's analyze the given Python function `interval_contains` step by step with the provided inputs.

1. The function is defined as `interval_contains(interval, val)`. It takes two arguments: `interval` and `val`.
2. The input for `interval` is given as `"array([-107.73502692,   -7.73502692])"`, which is a string representation of an array. However, this is not a valid Python list or tuple. In a real-world scenario, this would cause an error because the code expects `interval` to be a sequence (like a list or tuple) with two elements. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume that `interval` is properly parsed or converted into a sequence of two floats: `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]`.
3. The input for `val` is `-80.0`, a float value.

Next, the function proceeds as follows:
- Line 2: `a, b = interval` - This unpacks the two elements of the interval into `a` and `b`. If `interval` is `[-107.73502692, -7.73502692]`, then `a` becomes `-107.73502692` and `b` becomes `-7.73502692`.
- Line 3: `if a > b:` - This checks if `a` is greater than `b`. In our case, `-107.73502692` is less than `-7.73502692`, so this condition is false and the code skips to line 5.
- Line 5: `return a <= val <= b` - This checks if `val` is between `a` and `b` (inclusive). Since `a` is `-107.73502692`, `val` is `-80.0`, and `b` is `-7.73502692`, we need to determine if `-107.73502692 <= -80.0 <= -7.73502692`.

Evaluating the inequality:
- `-107.73502692 <= -80.0` is true because -107.73502692 is less than -80.0.
- `-80.0 <= -7.73502692` is also true because -80.0 is less than -7.73502692.

Since both parts of the inequality are true, the entire expression evaluates to true.

Therefore, the function `interval_contains` will return `True` for the given inputs.
