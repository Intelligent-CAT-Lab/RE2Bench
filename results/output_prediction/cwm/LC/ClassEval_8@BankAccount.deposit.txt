I will reason step by step about how the deposit function will execute.

First, let's look at the inputs. The self.balance is 0, and the amount to deposit is 300.

The function deposit starts by checking if amount is less than 0. Since 300 is greater than 0, this condition is false, so it skips raising an error.

Next, it adds the amount (300) to the balance. The new balance becomes 0 + 300 = 300.

Finally, the function returns the updated balance, which is 300.

    "output": 300
