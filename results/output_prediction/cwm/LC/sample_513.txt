Let's step through the function f(array) with the input array = [].

First, we check if -1 is in the array. Since the array is empty, this condition is false, so we skip the first while loop.

Next, we check if 0 is in the array. Again, the array is empty, so this condition is false, and we skip the second while loop.

Then, we check if 1 is in the array. The array is still empty, so this condition is also false, and we skip the third while loop.

Finally, we reach the return statement. The array has not been modified because all the while loops were skipped, so we return the original empty array.
