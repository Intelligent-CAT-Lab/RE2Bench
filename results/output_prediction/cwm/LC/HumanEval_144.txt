Let's break down the function call step by step.

1. The function `simplify` is called with `x = "7/2"` and `n = "4/2"`.
2. The variable `x` is split into two parts using the `/` delimiter, assigning `a = "7"` and `b = "2"`.
3. The variable `n` is split into two parts using the `/` delimiter, assigning `c = "4"` and `d = "2"`.
4. The `numerator` is calculated by multiplying `a` and `c` after converting them to integers. This results in `numerator = 7 * 4 = 28`.
5. The `denom` (denominator) is calculated by multiplying `b` and `d` after converting them to integers. This results in `denom = 2 * 2 = 4`.
6. The code checks if `numerator / denom` equals its integer value. In this case, `28 / 4 = 7.0`, which is an integer. Therefore, the condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` evaluates to `True`.
7. Since the condition is true, the function returns `True`.
