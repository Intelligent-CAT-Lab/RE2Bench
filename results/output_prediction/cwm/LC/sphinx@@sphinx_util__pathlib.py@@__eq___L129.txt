The `__eq__` method is called with `self` and `other` as the parameters. In this case, the `self` is an empty dictionary and `other` is an instance of `_StrPath` with the path "/tmp/pytest-of-changshu/pytest-41/root/_build/html".

Since `self` is not an instance of `PurePath` or `str`, the function should return `NotImplemented`. This is because the method does not handle the case where `self` is not a path or string.
