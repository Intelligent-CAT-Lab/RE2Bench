Let's analyze the `check_in` function step by step using the provided input.

1. **Initialization of Hotel instance:**
   - `self.name = "Test Hotel"`
   - `self.available_rooms = {"single": 1, "double": 2}`
   - `self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}` (empty dictionary for single room type)

2. **Calling `check_in(room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1")`:**

   - **Line 1:** `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`
     - Checks if "single" is in `self.booked_rooms.keys()`
     - "single" is present in keys (it's defined as `{"single": {}}`), so this condition is **False**
     - Function does not return False at this point

   - **Line 2:** `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`
     - Checks if "guest 1" is in `self.booked_rooms["single"]` (which is an empty dict)
     - "guest 1" is not present, so this condition is **False**
     - Function does not proceed with the nested if/else logic

3. **Since none of the conditions are met, the function reaches the end without returning anything:**
   - In Python, if a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns `None` by default

Therefore, the `check_in` function will return `None` in this case.
