Let's walk through the execution step by step.

1. The input is `"776013196293085 2.60"`, which is split into two variables: `a` and `b`. 
   - `a = "776013196293085"`
   - `b = "2.60"`

2. The string `b` is modified by concatenating the first character and the third character onwards. 
   - The first character is `"2"`.
   - The third character onwards is `"60"`.
   - So, `b = "2" + "60" = "260"`.

3. The variable `a` is converted to an integer: 
   - `a = 776013196293085`.

4. The variable `b` is converted to an integer: 
   - `b = 260`.

5. The product of `a` and `b` is calculated and then divided by 100 using integer division: 
   - `a * b = 776013196293085 * 260 = 201,533,611,196,402,200`.
   - Integer division by 100: `201,533,611,196,402,200 // 100 = 2,015,336,111,964,022`.

So, the output will be:
