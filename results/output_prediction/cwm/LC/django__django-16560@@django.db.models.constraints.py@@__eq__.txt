Let's analyze the given code step by step.

The `CheckConstraint` class has an `__eq__` method that overrides the default equality check. The method checks if the `other` object is also an instance of `CheckConstraint`. If it is, then it compares the `name`, `check`, `violation_error_code`, and `violation_error_message` attributes of both objects. If all these attributes are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `other` is not an instance of `CheckConstraint`, it calls the superclass's `__eq__` method.

Given the input, `self` and `other` are both instances of `CheckConstraint` with the same attributes:
- `name` is "price" for both.
- `check` has the same structure: `children` is `null`, `connector` is "AND", and `negated` is `false`.
- `violation_error_code` is "custom_code" for both.
- `violation_error_message` has the same structure: `_proxy____args` is a list containing "Constraint “%(name)s” is violated.", and `_proxy____kw` is an empty dictionary.

Since all these attributes are equal, the `__eq__` method should return `True`.
