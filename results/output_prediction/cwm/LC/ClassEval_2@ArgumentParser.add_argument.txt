Let's go through the execution of the `add_argument` method step by step.

1. The method is called with arguments: `arg="age"`, `required=False`, and `arg_type=<class 'int'>`.

2. Since `required` is `False`, the condition `if required:` is not met, so the `self.required.add(arg)` line is skipped.

3. The next line, `self.types[arg] = arg_type`, updates the `types` dictionary. Specifically, it adds an entry where the key is `"age"` and the value is `<class 'int'>`.

4. Therefore, the `types` dictionary is updated to include `"age"` with the type `<class 'int'>`.

After these steps, the `add_argument` method modifies the `self.types` dictionary but does not return anything. Since the method is void, it does not produce any output.
