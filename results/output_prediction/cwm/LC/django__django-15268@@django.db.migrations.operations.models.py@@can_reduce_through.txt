1. The `can_reduce_through` function is called with `self` representing an `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instance and `operation` representing another operation.
2. Inside the function, the first part of the return statement checks the result of `super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label)`.
3. Since `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` doesn't override `can_reduce_through`, the call to `super()` will result in `False`, as there's no implementation to reduce through a different type of operation in this context.
4. The second part of the return statement checks if the `operation` is also an instance of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` but with a different type. However, in this case, the `operation` is an `AlterIndexTogetherOperation`, which is not of the same type as `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`.
5. Since neither condition is met, the function returns `False`.
