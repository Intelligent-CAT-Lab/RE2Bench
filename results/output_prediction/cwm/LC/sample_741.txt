Let's walk through the function `f` step by step with the given input.

1. The function `f` is called with `nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]` and `p = 6`.
2. Inside the function, `prev_p` is calculated as `p - 1`, which is `6 - 1 = 5`.
3. The condition `if prev_p < 0:` is checked. Since `prev_p` is `5`, which is not less than 0, this block is skipped.
4. The function returns `nums[prev_p]`, which is `nums[5]`.

The index `5` in the list `nums` corresponds to the value `1`.
