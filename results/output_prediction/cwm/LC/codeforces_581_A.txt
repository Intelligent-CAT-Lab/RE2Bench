Let's step through the code with the given input.

1. The input is read as a string and split into a list of strings using `split()`. This gives `x = ["1", "1"]`.
2. A for loop converts each string in the list to an integer. Now `x = [1, 1]`.
3. The first element of the list is assigned to `a` (which is 1), and the second element is assigned to `b` (also 1).
4. The minimum value in the list `x` is printed followed by a space. Since both elements are 1, the output so far is "1 " (without quotes).
5. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is calculated, which is `|1 - 1| = 0`. Since 0 is less than 2, the `else` branch is taken, and 0 is printed.

Therefore, the final output is "1 0".
