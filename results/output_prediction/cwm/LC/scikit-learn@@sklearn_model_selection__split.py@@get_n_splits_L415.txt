To predict the output of `get_n_splits`, given the provided input, let's simulate the execution of the program step by step and reason through the process.

The function `get_n_splits` is part of the `_BaseKFold` class, which is a base class for k-fold cross-validation. The purpose of `get_n_splits` is to return the number of splits (or folds) specified during the initialization of the object.

Here is the breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The object is initialized with parameters `n_splits`, `shuffle`, and `random_state`. From the given input:
   - `n_splits = 3`
   - `shuffle = False`
   - `random_state = null`

2. **Function `get_n_splits`**: This function simply returns `self.n_splits`, which is set during initialization.

Given this, the function `get_n_splits` will directly return the value of `n_splits` without considering the arguments `X`, `y`, or `groups` because these are not used within the function. The value of `self.n_splits` is already determined during the object's initialization.

Therefore, the output of `get_n_splits` will be the value of `self.n_splits`, which is `3`.
