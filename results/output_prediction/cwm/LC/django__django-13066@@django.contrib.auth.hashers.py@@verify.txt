1. First, `verify` calls `self._load_library()`. The `self` instance has `library` set to "argon2", so it proceeds to import the `argon2` module.
2. It successfully imports the module and returns it.
3. Then, the `encoded` string is split into `algorithm` and `rest` using the `$` delimiter. `algorithm` is "argon2", which matches `self.algorithm`, so the assertion holds.
4. Next, it attempts to verify the password using `argon2.PasswordHasher().verify('$' + rest, password)`. The password is "secret", and the encoded hash is a valid Argon2 hash.
5. Since the password matches the hash, the `verify` method returns `True`.
