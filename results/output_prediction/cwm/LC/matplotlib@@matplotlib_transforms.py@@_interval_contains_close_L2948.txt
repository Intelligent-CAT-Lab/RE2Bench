Let's break down the function `_interval_contains_close` step by step with the provided inputs.

1. **Function Parameters:**
   - `interval`: [0.001, 1.0]
   - `val`: 0.2
   - `rtol`: 1e-10 (this is the relative tolerance)

2. **First Line of Function:**
   ```python
   a, b = interval
   ```
   - This unpacks the interval into `a = 0.001` and `b = 1.0`.

3. **Check and Swap if Needed:**
   ```python
   if a > b:
       a, b = (b, a)
   ```
   - Since `a = 0.001` and `b = 1.0`, `a` is not greater than `b`, so no swap is needed. `a` remains 0.001, and `b` remains 1.0.

4. **Calculate Relative Tolerance:**
   ```python
   rtol = (b - a) * rtol
   ```
   - The difference `b - a` is `1.0 - 0.001 = 0.999`.
   - Multiplying by `rtol` (1e-10) gives `rtol = 0.999 * 1e-10 = 9.99e-11`.

5. **Check if `val` is Within the Interval with Tolerance:**
   ```python
   return a - rtol <= val <= b + rtol
   ```
   - `a - rtol = 0.001 - 9.99e-11 ≈ 0.001` (since 9.99e-11 is negligible compared to 0.001)
   - `b + rtol = 1.0 + 9.99e-11 ≈ 1.0` (again, negligible addition)
   - Now check if `0.2` is between `0.001` and `1.0`, which it is.

So, the value `0.2` is indeed within the interval `[0.001, 1.0]` when considering the small relative tolerance.
