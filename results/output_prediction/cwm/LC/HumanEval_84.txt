Let's go through the execution of the function `solve(N)` step by step with the given input `N = 147`.

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined as `def solve(N):` which takes one parameter `N`. In this case, `N` is 147.

2. **String Conversion**: The first operation inside the function is `str(N)`. This converts the integer `147` to the string `"147"`.

3. **Iteration Over Characters**: The expression `(int(i) for i in str(N))` is a generator that iterates over each character in the string `"147"` and converts them back to integers. This results in the sequence `[1, 4, 7]`.

4. **Summation**: The `sum()` function is applied to this sequence, which adds the numbers together: `1 + 4 + 7 = 12`.

5. **Binary Conversion**: The `bin()` function is used to convert the integer `12` into its binary representation. The result of `bin(12)` is `'0b1100'`. The `[2:]` slice removes the `'0b'` prefix, leaving `'1100'`.

6. **Return Statement**: The function returns `'1100'`.
