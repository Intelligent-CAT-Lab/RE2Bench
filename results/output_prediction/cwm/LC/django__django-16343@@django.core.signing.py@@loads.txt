Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to determine the output of the `loads` function given the input string and the default parameters. 

First, the `loads` function calls `TimestampSigner.unsign_object` with the provided string `s`, using a `JSONSerializer` by default. The string appears to be a signed and serialized JSON object, encoded in base64. 

The string `s` is split into three parts by the colon (`:`) character: the payload, the timestamp, and the signature. Here, the payload is `"eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9"`, the timestamp is `"1u7SIo"`, and the signature is `"wF3XgnVXy3Uny-ff_G2pL1VcbThKPy56l3Vn9gnoLso"`.

1. **Decoding the Payload**: The payload is a base64-encoded JSON object. Decoding `"eyJhIjoiZGljdGlvbmFyeSJ9"` from base64 yields the JSON string `{"a":"djangoary"}`.

2. **Deserializing the JSON**: Using the `JSONSerializer`, the JSON string `{"a":"djangoary"}` is deserialized into a Python dictionary `{"a": "djangoary"}`.

3. **Validation and Return**: Since there's no `max_age` specified, the timestamp validation is skipped. The function returns the deserialized dictionary.

Therefore, the output should be a dictionary with the key `"a"` and the value `"djangoary"`.
