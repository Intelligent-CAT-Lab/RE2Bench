Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input.
2. The list provided in the input is `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`.
3. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`.
4. For each element `e`, it checks if `e > 0`. If this condition is true, the element is included in the resulting list.
5. Evaluating each element:
   - `-1` is not greater than 0, so it is excluded.
   - `-2` is not greater than 0, so it is excluded.
   - `4` is greater than 0, so it is included.
   - `5` is greater than 0, so it is included.
   - `6` is greater than 0, so it is included.
6. The resulting list is `[4, 5, 6]`.
