To determine the output of `morsel_to_cookie`, we need to analyze the given input and the function's behavior step-by-step.

1. The input `morsel` has several fields, including `expires`, `path`, `comment`, `domain`, `max-age`, `secure`, `httponly`, `version`, and `samesite`. 

2. The function `morsel_to_cookie` starts by initializing `expires` to `None`.

3. The function checks if `morsel['max-age']` is truthy. However, since `morsel['max-age']` is an empty string, this condition evaluates to `False`.

4. Next, it checks if `morsel['expires']` is truthy. Here, `morsel['expires']` is "woops", which is a non-empty string, so this condition is `True`.

5. The function then attempts to parse `morsel['expires']` using `time.strptime` with the format `'%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT'`. Since "woops" does not match this format, `time.strptime` will raise a `ValueError`.

6. However, the function does not handle this `ValueError` exception. Instead, it proceeds to call `create_cookie` with the parsed `expires` value, which would have been set to the result of `calendar.timegm` if the parsing were successful.

7. The `create_cookie` function is called with various parameters derived from `morsel` and the computed `expires` value. 

8. Inside `create_cookie`, a dictionary `result` is initialized with default values for a cookie. Then, it updates `result` with the provided keyword arguments.

9. The function checks for any unexpected keyword arguments and raises a `TypeError` if any are found. In this case, since all arguments are expected, no error is raised.

10. Finally, `create_cookie` returns a `Cookie` object constructed from the `result` dictionary.

Given the input and the function's behavior, the output will be a `Cookie` object with the specified parameters. However, since the `expires` field in the input is invalid, the actual value of `expires` in the output will be incorrect. But based on the structure provided, we need to predict the output variable values.

The `create_cookie` function will return a `Cookie` object with the following attributes:
- `version`: 0 (default)
- `name`: The key of the `morsel` object (not provided in the input, but assumed to be a valid string)
- `value`: The value of the `morsel` object (not provided in the input, but assumed to be a valid string)
- `port`: None (default)
- `domain`: "" (from `morsel['domain']`)
- `path`: "" (from `morsel['path']`)
- `secure`: False (since `morsel['secure']` is an empty string)
- `expires`: The result of parsing "woops" with `calendar.timegm`, which will be incorrect due to the invalid input
- `discard`: False (default)
- `comment`: "" (from `morsel['comment']`)
- `comment_url`: False (since `morsel['comment']` is an empty string)
- `rest`: {"HttpOnly": ""} (from `morsel['httponly']`)
- `rfc2109`: False (default)

Since the actual value of `expires` cannot be determined due to the invalid input, we will represent it as a placeholder in the output structure.
