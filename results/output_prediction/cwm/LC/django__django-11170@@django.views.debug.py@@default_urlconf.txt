1. Inside the `default_urlconf` function, it attempts to open the file `default_urlconf.html` from the `templates` directory.
2. It then reads the contents of the file and passes it to `DEBUG_ENGINE.from_string()` to create a `Template` object.
3. The `Context` object is created with a dictionary containing the `version` key, which is obtained from `get_docs_version()`.
4. The `render()` method of the `Template` object is called with the `Context` object, and the result is returned as an `HttpResponse` with a `content_type` of 'text/html'.
