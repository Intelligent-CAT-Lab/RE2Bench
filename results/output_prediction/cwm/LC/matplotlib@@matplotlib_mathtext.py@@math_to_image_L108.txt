1. The function `math_to_image` is called with the parameters `s="$x^2$"` (a mathematical expression), `filename_or_obj` (a file path to save the image), `prop=None`, `dpi=None`, `format=None`, and `color=None`.

2. A `MathTextParser` object `parser` is created with the output set to 'path', indicating that the parser will generate vector paths for the mathematical expression.

3. The `parse` method of the `parser` is called with the string `s`, `dpi=72`, and `prop=None`. This parses the mathematical expression into a vector path, returning dimensions: `width`, `height`, `depth`, and two other values (not used in this context).

4. A `Figure` object `fig` is created with a size calculated from the parsed dimensions, scaled appropriately for the figure's DPI (dots per inch).

5. The mathematical expression is added as text to the figure using `fig.text()`, positioned based on the parsed depth and height. The text's font properties and color are set according to the input parameters.

6. The figure is saved to the specified file path using `fig.savefig()`, with the DPI and format parameters passed as specified (or defaulted if not provided).

7. Finally, the function returns the `depth` value, which is one of the dimensions obtained from parsing the mathematical expression.
