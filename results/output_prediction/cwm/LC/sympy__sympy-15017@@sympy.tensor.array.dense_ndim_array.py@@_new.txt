The provided function is `_new`, a class method of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`. It's responsible for creating a new instance of this class. Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. **Inputs**:
   - `cls`: The class `ImmutableDenseNDimArray` (though the provided input seems incomplete or abstracted).
   - `iterable`: A 2x2 matrix (rows=2, cols=2), though the `_mat` attribute is null. This suggests that `iterable` is likely a matrix or array with 4 elements.
   - `shape`: `null`, indicating that the shape is to be inferred from the `iterable`.

2. **Processing**:
   - The first line calls `cls._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs(iterable, shape, **kwargs)`. Since `shape` is null, this function likely infers the shape from the `iterable`, which is a 2x2 matrix. Thus, the shape becomes `(2, 2)`.
   - The `flat_list` is generated by flattening the `iterable`, resulting in a tuple of the 4 elements (though the actual elements are not specified in the input).
   - A new instance `self` of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray` is created using `Basic.__new__` with the flattened list and shape.
   - The `_shape` attribute is set to the inferred shape, which is a tuple of the dimensions, e.g., `(2, 2)`.
   - The `_array` attribute is set to the list version of `flat_list`, which contains the 4 elements of the matrix.
   - The `_rank` is determined by the length of the shape tuple, which is 2 (since it's a 2D matrix).
   - The `_loop_size` is calculated as the product of all dimensions in the shape, which is 2 * 2 = 4.

3. **Output**:
   - The output structure requires `_shape`, `_array`, `_rank`, and `_loop_size`.
   - `_shape` is the tuple `(2, 2)`.
   - `_array` is the list of the 4 elements from the matrix (though the actual values are not provided, we'll assume they are placeholders).
   - `_rank` is 2.
   - `_loop_size` is 4.

Given the input, the output would reflect these values. However, since the actual elements of the matrix are not specified, we'll represent them as placeholders in the output.
