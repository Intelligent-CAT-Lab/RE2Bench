Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `any_int` is called with arguments x=2, y=1, z=1.
2. It checks if all arguments x, y, z are integers using `isinstance()`. Here, x=2, y=1, and z=1 are all integers, so the condition is satisfied.
3. The next condition checks if any pair of numbers adds up to the third:
   - Check if x + y == z: 2 + 1 == 1 → False
   - Check if x + z == y: 2 + 1 == 1 → False
   - Check if y + z == x: 1 + 1 == 2 → True (this condition is satisfied)
4. Since the condition `y + z == x` is True, the function returns True.

So, the output should be True.
