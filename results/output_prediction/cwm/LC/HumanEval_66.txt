Okay, let's break down the function and input step by step. The function is called digitSum(s), and the input string is "You arE Very Smart". 

First, the function checks if the input string s is empty. Since it's "You arE Very Smart", that's not empty, so it skips the if statement.

Then, it returns the sum of ord(char) for each character in the string that is uppercase. Let's list out the uppercase letters in "You arE Very Smart":

- 'Y' (from "You")
- 'E' (from "arE")
- 'V' (from "Very")
- 'S' (from "Smart")

Now, let's find their ASCII values:
- ord('Y') = 89
- ord('E') = 69
- ord('V') = 86
- ord('S') = 83

Adding these together: 89 + 69 + 86 + 83 = let's calculate step by step:
89 + 69 = 158
158 + 86 = 244
244 + 83 = 327

So the sum should be 327.
