Let's analyze the execution of the `write_csv` function step by step.

1. The `write_csv` function is called with the arguments:
   - `data`: a list of two lists. The first list has four strings ["a", "b", "c", "d"], and the second list has one string ["ME"].
   - `file_name`: "read_test_process.csv"

2. Inside the `write_csv` function, a try block is executed to handle potential exceptions.

3. The function attempts to open a file named "read_test_process.csv" in write mode ('w') with a newline parameter set to an empty string. The newline parameter is important for ensuring that the CSV writer handles newlines correctly across different operating systems.

4. Once the file is opened, a `csv.writer` object is created, which will be used to write the data to the CSV file.

5. The `writerows` method of the `csv.writer` object is called with the `data` argument. This method writes multiple rows to the CSV file. Each row in the `data` list is written as a separate line in the CSV file.

6. The first row ["a", "b", "c", "d"] will be written as "a,b,c,d" in the CSV file.
7. The second row ["ME"] will be written as "ME" in the CSV file.

8. After writing the data, the file is automatically closed due to the `with` statement.

9. Since no exceptions occurred during the execution, the function returns 1 to indicate success.

Therefore, the output of the `write_csv` function will be 1, indicating that the CSV file was successfully written.
