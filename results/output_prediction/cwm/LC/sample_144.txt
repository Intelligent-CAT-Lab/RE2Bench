<think>
The function `f` takes a list of lists called `vectors`. It initializes an empty list `sorted_vecs`. Then, it iterates over each `vec` in `vectors`. For each `vec`, it sorts the list in place using `vec.sort()` and appends the sorted list to `sorted_vecs`. Finally, it returns `sorted_vecs`.

In this specific input, `vectors` is an empty list `[]`. The for loop does not execute because there are no elements to iterate over. As a result, `sorted_vecs` remains an empty list. The function returns this empty list.
