The function `get_topmost_subplotspec` is called with an instance of `SubplotSpec`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function starts by calling `get_gridspec`, which returns the `_gridspec` attribute of the instance. In this case, it's `"GridSpec(1, 1)"`.

2. The function then checks if this `gridspec` object has a method called `get_topmost_subplotspec`. Since `gridspec` is `"GridSpec(1, 1)"`, which is a string and not an object with methods, the `hasattr` check returns `False`.

3. Because the `hasattr` check is `False`, the function proceeds to the `else` branch and returns `self`.

The result of the function is the instance itself because the `gridspec` does not have the required method. This instance has the attributes:
- `_gridspec` = "GridSpec(1, 1)"
- `num1` = np.int64(0)
- `_num2` = np.int64(0)
