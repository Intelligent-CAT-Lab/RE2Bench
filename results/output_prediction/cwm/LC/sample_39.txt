Okay, so I need to figure out what the function f returns given the inputs. Let's break it down step by step.

The function f takes two arguments: array and elem. The code checks if elem is in the array. If it is, it returns the index of the first occurrence of elem in array. If not, it returns -1.

Given the input, array is [6, 2, 7, 1] and elem is 6. 

First, check if 6 is in the array. The array starts with 6 as the first element, so yes, 6 is present.

Now, find the index of the first occurrence. Since 6 is at position 0 (the first element), the function should return 0.

Wait, but wait, in Python, list indices start at 0, right? So the first element is index 0, second is 1, etc. So in the array [6, 2, 7, 1], the index of 6 is indeed 0.

So the function should return 0. That's straightforward. I don't see any edge cases here since the element exists and is the first element.
