Let's go through the code step by step.

1. The code reads input from the user and splits it into two parts, `a` and `b`. The input given is "982906996 135497281". So, `a` becomes "982906996" and `b` becomes "135497281".
2. The code reverses the string `b` using slicing (`b[::-1]`), which gives "182794531". Then it converts this reversed string to an integer, so `b` becomes 182794531.
3. The code converts `a` to an integer, which is 982906996, and adds it to the integer value of `b` (182794531).
4. The result of the addition is 982906996 + 182794531 = 1165701527.
5. Finally, the code prints this result.
