I need to figure out the output of the `unique` function with the given input. Let's walk through it step by step. 

The function `unique` takes a list `l` and returns a sorted list of its unique elements. The input list is [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]. 

First, the function converts the list into a set. A set in Python contains only unique elements, so duplicates are removed. The original list has duplicates of 5, 3. When converted to a set, these duplicates are removed, resulting in {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}. 

Then, this set is converted back into a list. The order of elements in a set is not guaranteed, so the list might look like [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123] or any other permutation of these numbers. 

Finally, the list is sorted. Sorting these numbers in ascending order gives [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]. 

So, the output of the function should be the sorted list of unique elements from the input list.

    "output": [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
