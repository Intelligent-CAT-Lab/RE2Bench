Let's go through the function step by step to find the output of `change_base(4, 5)`.

1. The function starts with `ret = ''`. This initializes an empty string that will hold the result.
   
2. The function enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `x > 0`. Since `x` is initially 4, the loop runs.

3. Inside the loop:
   - `x % base` calculates the remainder when `x` is divided by `base`. With `x = 4` and `base = 5`, this is 4.
   - `str(x % base)` converts this remainder to a string, so we have "4".
   - This string is concatenated to the beginning of `ret`, which is currently empty. So `ret` becomes "4".
   - `x //= base` updates `x` by performing integer division of `x` by `base`. So `4 // 5` equals 0.

4. The loop condition is checked again. Since `x` is now 0, the loop exits.

5. The function returns `ret`, which is "4".

Therefore, the output of `change_base(4, 5)` is "4".
