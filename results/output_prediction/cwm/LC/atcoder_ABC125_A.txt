Let's step through the execution of the program with the given input.

The input string is "1 1 1". This means that the variables A, B, and T will all be assigned the integer value 1.

1. The first line of the program reads the input and splits it into three integers using the `split()` method. This results in A = 1, B = 1, T = 1.
2. The second line calculates the variable `ans`. It does so by performing integer division of T by A, which is 1 // 1 = 1, and then multiplies the result by B, which is 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, `ans` is assigned the value 1.
3. The third line prints the value of `ans`, which is 1.

Here's the summarized reasoning:

The program reads three integers from input, splits them into variables A, B, and T, all set to 1. It calculates ans as (T // A) * B, resulting in 1. Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 1.
