Okay, let's go through the execution of `update_product_quantity` step by step.

First, the instance `self` has an inventory where product_id "1" exists with a quantity of 2. The method is called with product_id 1 (which is an integer) and quantity -3.

The first line of the method checks if `product_id` is in `self.inventory`. However, `self.inventory` uses string keys ("1"), and the provided `product_id` is an integer (1). In Python, "1" (string) is not the same as 1 (integer), so the condition `if product_id in self.inventory` evaluates to False.

Since the condition is False, the code inside the if block is skipped. That means the quantity is not updated. The method ends without making any changes to the inventory.

Therefore, the output should indicate that no change occurred, but looking at the structure, the output is just a placeholder. Since the method doesn't return anything explicitly, the output would be None.
