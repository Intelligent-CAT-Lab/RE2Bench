I need to calculate the surface area of a sphere with radius 2 using the formula 4 * π * r².

Step 1: Calculate the radius squared (2^2 = 4).
Step 2: Multiply by π (approximately 3.14159) to get 4 * π = 12.56637.
Step 3: Multiply the result by 4 to get the final surface area: 50.26548.

The final result should be approximately 50.26548245743669 due to π's exact value and floating-point precision.
