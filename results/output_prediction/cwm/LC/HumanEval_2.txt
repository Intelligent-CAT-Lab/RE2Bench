Let's go step by step to execute the `truncate_number` function.

The function is defined as:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number % 1.0
```

It takes a float number as input and returns the fractional part of the number using the modulo operator with 1.0.

Given the input:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "number": 1.33
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

The function will be called with `number = 1.33`.

The operation `1.33 % 1.0` computes the remainder after dividing 1.33 by 1.0. Since 1.0 goes into 1.33 once with a remainder of 0.33, the result is 0.33.

Therefore, the output of the function will be 0.33.
