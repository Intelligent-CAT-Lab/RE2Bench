Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The code reads the input using `input()`, which will be `avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc` (without the surrounding double quotes, since Python's `input()` function removes them).
2. The string `avrnc,fwujpcm,ggjmc` is passed to the `replace` method with the arguments `','` and `' '`. This replaces all commas with spaces.
3. The result of this replacement is `avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc`.
4. The `print` function outputs the modified string.

The output will be:
[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "avrnc fwujpcm ggjmc"
}
[/OUTPUT]
