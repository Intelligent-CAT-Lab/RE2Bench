Let's break down the execution of `_make_subclass` step by step with the given inputs.

1. The function is called with the arguments:
   - `name`: "secret"
   - `module`: "unknown"
   - `superclass`: `_MockObject` (default value)
   - `attributes`: None (default value)
   - `decorator_args`: () (default value)

2. The first step inside the function is to create the `attrs` dictionary:
   - `__module__`: This is set to the `module` argument, which is "unknown".
   - `__display_name__`: This is created by concatenating the `module` and `name` with a dot in between, resulting in "unknown.secret".
   - `__name__`: This is set to the `name` argument, which is "secret".
   - `__sphinx_decorator_args__`: This is set to the `decorator_args` tuple, which is an empty tuple ().

3. The `attrs.update(attributes or {})` line tries to update the `attrs` dictionary with the `attributes` argument. Since `attributes` is None, it defaults to an empty dictionary, so no additional attributes are added.

4. Finally, the function returns a new type created using the `type` function:
   - The new type's name is "secret".
   - Its base class is `_MockObject`.
   - The attributes of the new type are defined in the `attrs` dictionary.

Now, let's determine the output based on the structure provided:
- `__module__`: "unknown"
- `__display_name__`: "unknown.secret"
- `__name__`: "secret"
- `__sphinx_decorator_args__`: ()
- `__doc__`: This attribute is not explicitly set in the `attrs` dictionary. Since the `attributes` argument is None, and the default `superclass` is `_MockObject`, we need to consider what the `__doc__` of `_MockObject` might be. However, without knowing the exact definition of `_MockObject`, we can assume that if it doesn't have a `__doc__` attribute, the new type will also not have one, or it might inherit it. But since the problem doesn't provide information about `_MockObject`'s `__doc__`, we'll have to leave it as is or assume it's not set, which might result in `None` or an empty string. However, in Python, if a class doesn't have a `__doc__` attribute, it defaults to `None`. Therefore, the `__doc__` will be `None`.
