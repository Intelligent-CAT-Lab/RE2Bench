Let's break down the execution step-by-step:

1. The function `f` is called with the arguments `text="g"` and `n=15`.
2. The first line of the function checks if the length of `text` is less than or equal to 2. Since `text` is "g", its length is 1, which satisfies this condition.
3. Because the condition is true, the function immediately returns `text`, which is "g".

Therefore, the function returns "g" without any further processing.
