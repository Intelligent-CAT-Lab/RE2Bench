Let's walk through the code line by line with the given input, where `n` is 5.

1. The function `starts_one_ends` is called with `n = 5`. So we enter the function.
2. The first line checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 5, this condition is false, so we skip this line.
3. The next line is executed: `return 18 * 10 ** (n - 2)`. Let's break this down:
   - `n - 2` equals `5 - 2 = 3`.
   - `10 ** 3` is `1000`.
   - `18 * 1000 = 18000`.
4. Therefore, the function returns `18000`.
