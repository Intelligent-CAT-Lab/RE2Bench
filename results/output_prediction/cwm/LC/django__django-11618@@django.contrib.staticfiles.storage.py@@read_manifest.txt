The task is to predict the output of the `read_manifest` method given the input. Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. **Understanding the Method**: The `read_manifest` method is part of the `ManifestFilesMixin` class. It attempts to read and decode the contents of a file named `staticfiles.json` using the `open` method provided by the storage backend. If the file does not exist (raises a `FileNotFoundError`), it returns `None`.

2. **Input Analysis**: The input provides an instance of a storage backend (`staticfiles_storage`) that is configured with a specific location (`/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr`). The `read_manifest` method is called without any arguments.

3. **Execution Flow**:
    - The method calls `self.open(self.manifest_name)`. Here, `self.manifest_name` is `'staticfiles.json'`.
    - The `open` method is part of the storage backend, which, in this case, is a `StaticFilesStorage` instance. This instance has a `location` attribute set to `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr`.
    - The `open` method calls `_open`, which in turn calls `path` to construct the full path to the file. The `path` method combines the `location` with the file name `'staticfiles.json'`, resulting in `/tmp/django__qhwfn8e/tmpzocmelzr/staticfiles.json`.
    - Since the `staticfiles.json` file is not mentioned in the provided hashed files or any other context, it's reasonable to assume it does not exist in the specified location.
    - Therefore, attempting to open this file will raise a `FileNotFoundError`, and the method will return `None`.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the information and the execution flow, the output of `read_manifest` will be `None` because the `staticfiles.json` file does not exist in the specified location.
