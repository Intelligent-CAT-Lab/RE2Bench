The function `parse` is called with the version string "1.11.3". Inside `parse`, it attempts to create a `Version` object. The `Version` class parses the version string using a regular expression. For "1.11.3", the regex match will capture the release part as "1.11.3", which is split into the tuple (1, 11, 3). Since there are no pre, post, dev, or local version components, those fields will be set to their default values (empty tuples or None). The `_key` is generated based on these parsed components. Since the version string is valid, no `InvalidVersion` exception is raised, and the `Version` object is successfully created and returned.
