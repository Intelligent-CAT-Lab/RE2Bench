Okay, let's break down the code step by step with the given input.

The input is "7 5 5". The first line of code reads this input, splits it into individual numbers, converts them into integers, and stores them in a tuple called ABC. So ABC becomes (7, 5, 5).

The next line checks if the count of 5 in ABC is exactly 2. Since there are two 5s, this condition is true. 

Inside the if block, the code checks if the sum of ABC equals 17. Let's calculate that sum: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17. Since this condition is also true, the code prints 'YES'.

So the final output should be 'YES'.
