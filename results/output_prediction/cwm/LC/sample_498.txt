Let's analyze the given function `f` and the provided input.

The function `f` takes three arguments:
1. `nums` - a list of integers.
2. `idx` - an integer representing the index.
3. `added` - an integer to be added to the list.

The function modifies the list `nums` by inserting the value `added` at the specified index `idx`, using slice assignment: `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)`. Slice assignment replaces the elements from index `idx` to `idx` (which is essentially inserting at position `idx`) with the elements in the tuple `(added,)`.

Given the input:
- `nums` is `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`
- `idx` is `2`
- `added` is `3`

We need to determine the result of inserting `3` at index `2` in the list `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.

Inserting `3` at index `2` will shift the existing elements from index `2` onwards to the right, making the new list `[2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.

Thus, the function `f` will return this modified list.
