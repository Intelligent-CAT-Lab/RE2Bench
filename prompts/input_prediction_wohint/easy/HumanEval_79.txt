You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided output (between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]) and predict the input of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. You only need to predict input variable values, and print input between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between [THOUGHT] and [/THOUGHT]. 
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
from inspect import cleandoc
import re
from email.parser import HeaderParser
from email.errors import HeaderParseError
def parse_docstring(docstring):
    if not docstring:
        return '', '', {}
    docstring = cleandoc(docstring)
    parts = re.split(r'\n{2,}', docstring)
    title = parts[0]
    if len(parts) == 1:
        body = ''
        metadata = {}
    else:
        parser = HeaderParser()
        try:
            metadata = parser.parsestr(parts[-1])
        except HeaderParseError:
            metadata = {}
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
        else:
            metadata = dict(metadata.items())
            if metadata:
                body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:-1])
            else:
                body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
    return title, body, metadata
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `parse_docstring`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": ("firstline", "second line", {})
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
From `title = parts[0] = "firstline" ` we can know that the first part from splitting the cleaned docstring must have been "firstline"
From `body = "second line"` we can know that there must have been at least one more part after the first, and it must not have been parsed as valid metadata.
From `metadata = {}` we can know that either there was no metadata section, or an attempt to parse metadata failed (raised HeaderParseError).
From the above, we can reconstruct: `parts = ['firstline', 'secondline']`. 
This means the cleaned docstring must have looked like: `firstline\n\nsecond line`. This would split into two parts when re.split(r'\n{2,}', ...) is applied.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {}, 
    "args": {
        "docstring": "firstline\n\nsecond line"
    },
    kwargs: {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[PYTHON]
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return 'db' + bin(decimal)[2:] + 'db'
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `decimal_to_binary` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "db0db"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
