You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this piece of code, I want you to take the provided output (between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]) and predict the input of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. You only need to predict input variable values, and print input between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between [THOUGHT] and [/THOUGHT]. 
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
from inspect import cleandoc
import re
from email.parser import HeaderParser
from email.errors import HeaderParseError

docstring = input()
if not docstring:
    print(' \t ')
docstring = cleandoc(docstring)
parts = re.split(r'\n{2,}', docstring)
title = parts[0]
if len(parts) == 1:
    body = ''
    metadata = {}
else:
    parser = HeaderParser()
    try:
        metadata = parser.parsestr(parts[-1])
    except HeaderParseError:
        metadata = {}
        body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
    else:
        metadata = dict(metadata.items())
        if metadata:
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:-1])
        else:
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
if metadata:
    print(f"title\t\tbody")
else:
    print(f"title\tbody")
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of the code snippet, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "firstline\tsecond line"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{
    "input": XXX
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[THOUGHT]
From `title = parts[0] = "firstline" ` we can know that the first part from splitting the cleaned docstring must have been "firstline"
From `body = "second line"` we can know that there must have been at least one more part after the first, and it must not have been parsed as valid metadata.
Since the is only 1 '\t' in the output, we can know that `metadata = {}`.
From `metadata = {}` we can know that either there was no metadata section, or an attempt to parse metadata failed (raised HeaderParseError).
From the above, we can reconstruct: `parts = ['firstline', 'secondline']`. 
This means the cleaned docstring must have looked like: `firstline\n\nsecond line`. This would split into two parts when re.split(r'\n{2,}', ...) is applied.
[/THOUGHT]

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "firstline\n\nsecond line"
}
```
[/INPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
if ABC.count(5) == 2:
    print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')
else:
    print('NO')
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of the code snippet, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "YES"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
