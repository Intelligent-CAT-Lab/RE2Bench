You are given a Python function (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this function, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and /INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. You need to predict output variable values, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between [THOUGHT] and [/THOUGHT]. 
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
import re
import string

def normalize_text(text, remove_punctuation=True):
    text = text.lower().strip()
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    if remove_punctuation:
        text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    return text
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `normalize_text` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "text": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. Since `remove_punctuation=True` by default, we proceed with that.
2. `.lower()` converts all characters to lowercase. `.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace (including the \n newline at the end). So the input `text` becomes "hello, world!  this is   a test..."
3. `text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)`  replaces any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) with a single space. The `text` will be transformed into: "hello, world! this is a test...".
4. Since `remove_punctuation` is True, the code inside the if branch removes all characters found in string.punctuation, which includes: "!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~". It removes the comma, exclamation mark, and periods, resulting in: "hello world this is a test".
5. The return value will be "hello world this is a test".

[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": "hello world this is a test"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]

[PYTHON]
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return 'db' + bin(decimal)[2:] + 'db'
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of `decimal_to_binary` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "decimal": 0
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
