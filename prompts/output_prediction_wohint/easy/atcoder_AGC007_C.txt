You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this piece of code, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [/INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The output structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [/STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between [THOUGHT] and [/THOUGHT]. 

[PYTHON]
import re
import string

text = input()
text = text.lower().strip()
text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
if remove_punctuation:
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
print(text)
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The code will read the input from console, so text will be `Hello World, This is a Test.`.
2. `.lower()` converts all characters to lowercase. `.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace (including the \n newline at the end). So the input `text` becomes "hello, world!  this is   a test..."
3. `text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)`  replaces any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) with a single space. The `text` will be transformed into: "hello, world! this is a test...".
4. Since `remove_punctuation` is True, the code inside the if branch removes all characters found in string.punctuation, which includes: "!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~". It removes the comma, exclamation mark, and periods, resulting in: "hello world this is a test".
5. The return value will be "hello world this is a test".

[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": "hello world this is a test"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[PYTHON]
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 200
n, d, x = map(Decimal, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(1, int(n) + 1):
    i = Decimal(str(i))
    ans += Decimal(str(int(n) - int(i) + 1)) / Decimal(str(i)) * (d + x * Decimal(str(int(n) * 2 - 1)) / Decimal('2'))
print(ans)
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "\"199996 95 12\""
}
```
[/INPUT]
