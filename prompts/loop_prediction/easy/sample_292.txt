You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [STATE]{VARIABLE_NAME}=??[/STATE].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" beween [STATE] and [/STATE] with your prediction of the state of variables associated with LOOPS.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list.
* You need to predict the states of variables in For loops, While loops, or List Comprehensions.
* If the value of a varibale stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state.
* Determine variable states by tracing the code step by step. Wrap your reasoning in [THOUGHT] ... [/THOUGHT]
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t: ## [STATE]c=??[/STATE][STATE]t=??[/STATE]
4         if not c.isnumeric():
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/PYTHON]
The input to the method ```func``` is :
[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "t": "#284"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

Complete the loop annotations in the code with variable states.

[THOUGHT]
`t` is the string "#284". The loop iterates over each character in order:
`c` = '#'
`c` = '2'
`c` = '8'
`c` = '4'
`t` stays the same for every iteration.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t: ## [STATE]c=["#", "2", "8", "4"][/STATE][STATE]t=[["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"]][/STATE]
4         if not c.isnumeric():
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/ANSWER]
[/EXAMPLE]

1 def f(text):
2     new_text = [c if c.isdigit() else '*' for c in text]## [STATE]c=??[/STATE] [STATE]text=??[/STATE]
3     return ''.join(new_text)

The input to the method ```f``` is: 
 {
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "text": "5f83u23saa"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

Complete the loop annotations in the code with variable states.
