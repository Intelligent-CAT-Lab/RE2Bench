You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [STATE]{VARIABLE_NAME}=??[/STATE].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" beween [STATE] and [/STATE] with your prediction of the state of variables associated with LOOPS.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list.
* You need to predict the states of variables in For loops, While loops, or List Comprehensions.
* If the value of a varibale stays the same through K iterations, repeat its value for K times as its state.
* Determine variable states by tracing the code step by step. Wrap your reasoning in [THOUGHT] ... [/THOUGHT]
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
1 t = input()
2 count = 0 
3 for c in t: ## [STATE]c=??[/STATE][STATE]t=??[/STATE]
4     if not c.isnumeric(): 
5         count += 1
6 print(count)
[/PYTHON]
The input is：
[INPUT]
#284
[/INPUT]

Complete the loop annotations in the code with variable states.

[THOUGHT]
`t` is the string "#284". The loop iterates over each character in order:
`c` = '#'
`c` = '2'
`c` = '8'
`c` = '4'
`t` stays the same for every iteration.
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 t = input()
2 count = 0 
3 for c in t: ## [STATE]c=["#", "2", "8", "4"][/STATE][STATE]t=[["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"], ["#", "2", "8", "4"]][/STATE]
4     if not c.isnumeric(): 
5         count += 1
6 print(count)
[/ANSWER]
[/EXAMPLE]

1 n = int ( input ( ) )
2 i , j = 1 , n * n
3 while i < j :## [STATE]i<j=??[/STATE]
4     print ( i , j )
5     i += 1
6     j -= 1

The input is: 
 8

Complete the loop annotations in the code with variable states.
