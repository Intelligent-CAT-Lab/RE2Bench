You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" in "taken=??" with your prediction of whether the branches are taken during execution for the given input.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list (e.g., ['Y', 'N', ...]).
* For each time that branch point is encountered during execution:
   ** Append 'Y' if that branch is taken.
   ** Append 'N' if that branch is not taken.
* Determine branch outcomes by tracing the code step by step, paying special attention to conditionals and loop iterations. Wrap your reasoning in [THOUGHT] ... [/THOUGHT]
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t:
4         if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/PYTHON]
The input to the method ```func``` is :
[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "t": "#284"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".

[THOUGHT]
t = "#284" so the loop sees characters in order: '#', '2', '8', '4'.
At line 4, the condition is if not c.isnumeric():
c = '#': '#'.isnumeric() is False → not False is True → branch taken
c = '2': '2'.isnumeric() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
c = '8': branch not taken
c = '4':  branch not taken
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t:
4         if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,N,N,N][/BRANCH]
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/ANSWER]
[/EXAMPLE]

1 
2 def bf(planet1, planet2):
3 
4     planet_names = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
5     if planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
6         return ()
7     planet1_index = planet_names.index(planet1)
8     planet2_index = planet_names.index(planet2)
9     if planet1_index < planet2_index:
10         return (planet_names[planet1_index + 1: planet2_index])
11     else:
12         return (planet_names[planet2_index + 1 : planet1_index])
13 

The input to the method ```bf``` is: 
 {
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "planet1": "Earth",
        "planet2": "Earth"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".
