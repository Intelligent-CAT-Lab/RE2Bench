You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" in "taken=??" with your prediction of whether the branches are taken during execution for the given input.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list (e.g., ['Y', 'N', ...]).
* For each time that branch point is encountered during execution:
   ** Append 'Y' if that branch is taken.
   ** Append 'N' if that branch is not taken.
* Determine branch outcomes by tracing the code step by step, paying special attention to conditionals and loop iterations. Wrap your reasoning in [THOUGHT] ... [/THOUGHT]
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
1 t = input()
2 count = 0 
3 for c in t:
4     if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5         count += 1
6 print(count)
[/PYTHON]
The input is：
[INPUT]
#284
[/INPUT]

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".

[THOUGHT]
t = "#284" so the loop sees characters in order: '#', '2', '8', '4'.
At line 4, the condition is if not c.isnumeric():
c = '#': '#'.isnumeric() is False → not False is True → branch taken
c = '2': '2'.isnumeric() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
c = '8': branch not taken
c = '4':  branch not taken
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 t = input()
2 count = 0 
3 for c in t:
4     if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,N,N,N][/BRANCH]
5         count += 1
6 print(count)
[/ANSWER]
[/EXAMPLE]

1 anti , b , c , d = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
2 l = abs ( anti - c ) ; m = abs ( b - d )
3 if anti == c : print ( anti + m , b , c + m , d ) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
4 elif b == d : print ( anti , b + l , c , d + l ) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5 elif l != m : print ( - 1 ) ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
6 else : print ( anti , d , c , b )
7 
8 

The input is: 
 3 4 7 8

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".
