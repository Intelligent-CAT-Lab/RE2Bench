You will be given:
1. A Python code snippet wrapped in [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON]. The code includes branch markers in comments of the form # [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH].
2. A method input wrapped in [INPUT] ... [/INPUT].
Your task is to replace every "??" in "taken=??" with your prediction of whether the branches are taken during execution for the given input.

Detailed Instructions:
* Replace ?? with a list (e.g., ['Y', 'N', ...]).
* For each time that branch point is encountered during execution:
   ** Append 'Y' if that branch is taken.
   ** Append 'N' if that branch is not taken.
* Determine branch outcomes by tracing the code step by step, paying special attention to conditionals and loop iterations. Wrap your reasoning in [THOUGHT] ... [/THOUGHT]
* Output the fully annotated code (with ?? replaced) wrapped in [ANSWER] ... [/ANSWER]
* Do not remove, reorder, or add any code lines. 
* Preserve the original line numbers exactly as they appear in the [PYTHON] ... [/PYTHON] block.

Please follow the format in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t:
4         if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/PYTHON]
The input to the method ```func``` is :
[INPUT]
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "t": "#284"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
[/INPUT]

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".

[THOUGHT]
t = "#284" so the loop sees characters in order: '#', '2', '8', '4'.
At line 4, the condition is if not c.isnumeric():
c = '#': '#'.isnumeric() is False → not False is True → branch taken
c = '2': '2'.isnumeric() is True → not True is False → branch not taken
c = '8': branch not taken
c = '4':  branch not taken
[/THOUGHT]

[ANSWER]
1 def func(t):
2     count = 0 
3     for c in t:
4         if not c.isnumeric(): ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y,N,N,N][/BRANCH]
5             count += 1
6     return count
[/ANSWER]
[/EXAMPLE]

1 
2 def x_or_y(n, x, y):
3 
4     if n == 1: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
5         return y
6     for i in range(2, n):
7         if n % i == 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
8             return y
9             break
10     else:
11         return x
12 

The input to the method ```x_or_y``` is: 
 {
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 1259,
        "x": 3,
        "y": 52
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

Complete the branch annotation in the code with "Y" and "N".
