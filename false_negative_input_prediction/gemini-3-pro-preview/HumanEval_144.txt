[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify(x, n)` takes two string arguments representing fractions (e.g., "1/2").
1. It splits `x` into `a` (numerator) and `b` (denominator).
2. It splits `n` into `c` (numerator) and `d` (denominator).
3. It calculates a new numerator: `numerator = int(a) * int(c)`.
4. It calculates a new denominator: `denom = int(b) * int(d)`.
5. It checks if `numerator / denom` is an integer (i.e., if the division results in a whole number). If so, it returns `True`.

The target output is `True`. This means I need to find two fraction strings `x` and `n` such that when their numerators are multiplied and their denominators are multiplied, the resulting fraction simplifies to an integer.

Let's try to construct a simple case.
Let the resulting fraction be equal to 1.
So `numerator / denom == 1`.
This implies `(a * c) == (b * d)`.

Let's pick simple values.
Let `x = "2/1"`. Then `a=2`, `b=1`.
Let `n = "1/2"`. Then `c=1`, `d=2`.
`numerator = 2 * 1 = 2`.
`denom = 1 * 2 = 2`.
`numerator / denom` is `2 / 2 = 1.0`.
`int(1.0)` is `1`.
`1.0 == 1` is True.
This works. So `x="2/1"` and `n="1/2"` is a valid input pair.

Another case:
Let `x = "4/2"`. `a=4, b=2`.
Let `n = "1/1"`. `c=1, d=1`.
`numerator = 4 * 1 = 4`.
`denom = 2 * 1 = 2`.
`4/2 = 2.0`. Integer check passes.

I will use `x="2/1"` and `n="1/2"` for the input construction as it is a clean example.

Verifying steps:
`x` = "2/1", `n` = "1/2"
`a`="2", `b`="1"
`c`="1", `d`="2"
`numerator` = 2 * 1 = 2
`denom` = 1 * 2 = 2
`2 / 2` is 1.0. `int(1.0)` is 1.
1.0 == 1 is True.
Returns True. Matches output.
