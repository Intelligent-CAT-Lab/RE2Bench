To determine the input, I need to analyze the logic of the Python script and reverse-engineer potential inputs that produce the given output.

**1. Analyze the Code:**
*   `S, W = map(int, input().split())`: The script expects two integers as input, separated by a space. Let's call them `S` and `W`.
*   `print('unsafe') if S <= W else print('safe')`: The script prints "unsafe" if `S` is less than or equal to `W`. Otherwise, it prints "safe".

**2. Analyze the Output:**
*   The output is `"unsafe"`.

**3. Deduce the Condition:**
*   For the output to be "unsafe", the condition `S <= W` must be true.
*   This means any pair of integers where the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer will work.

**4. Formulate an Input:**
*   I need to pick two integers, let's say `10` and `20`.
*   Is `10 <= 20`? Yes.
*   So, input string `"10 20"` results in `S=10`, `W=20`. The condition holds, and "unsafe" is printed.
*   Alternatively, `10 10` also works because `10 <= 10`.
*   Let's choose specific numbers like `10` for S and `10` for W (or `10` and `100`). Let's use `10 100` for a clear case.

[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers S and W from standard input.
It prints "unsafe" if S <= W, otherwise "safe".
The target output is "unsafe".
Therefore, we need to provide two integers where the first one is less than or equal to the second one.
Example: S = 10, W = 100. Since 10 <= 100, the output will be "unsafe".
The input format is a single string with two space-separated numbers.
