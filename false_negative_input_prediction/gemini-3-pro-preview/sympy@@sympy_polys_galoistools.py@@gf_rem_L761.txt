<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

To result in `[2, 0]` which corresponds to the polynomial $2x$, `gf_rem` (which returns the remainder of polynomial division $f / g$ in $GF(p)$) needs appropriate inputs.
The coefficient 2 implies that the modulus $p$ must be greater than 2. Let's choose $p=5$.
The length of the remainder is 2 (degree 1). The divisor $g$ must have a degree greater than the remainder, so degree at least 2. Let's choose $g(x) = x^2$, represented as `[1, 0, 0]`.
We need $f \pmod g = 2x$. We can construct $f$ as $q \cdot g + r$.
Let the quotient $q = 1$ (represented as `[1]`).
Then $f = 1 \cdot x^2 + 2x = x^2 + 2x$, which corresponds to the coefficient list `[1, 2, 0]`.
In $GF(5)$, the calculation would be:
1. Divide $x^2 + 2x$ by $x^2$.
2. Leading term $x^2 / x^2 = 1$.
3. Subtract $1 \cdot (x^2)$ from $x^2 + 2x$, leaving $2x$.
4. $2x$ has degree 1, which is less than degree 2 of $g$, so it is the remainder.
5. The list representation of $2x$ is `[2, 0]`.

For the domain $K$, since the operation handles integer coefficients, the standard integer domain `ZZ` is appropriate. Since the input format is JSON, we represent the domain object as the string `"ZZ"`.
