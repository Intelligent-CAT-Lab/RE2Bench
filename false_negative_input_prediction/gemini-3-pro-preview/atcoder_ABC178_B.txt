To predict the input, I need to find four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that the maximum product of any combination of endpoints (`a*c`, `a*d`, `b*c`, `b*d`) equals `56183721947132200`.

This code calculates the maximum product possible when multiplying a number from range `[a, b]` with a number from range `[c, d]`. However, strictly speaking, the code just takes four distinct numbers and finds the maximum pair product from the set `{(a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d)}`.

Let's look at the target output: `56183721947132200`.

This is a large number, but it ends in `00`. Let's verify which factors might produce this.
Let's try to construct a simple case where `a*c` equals the target.
If `a = 56183721947132200` and `c = 1`, then `a*c` works.
Then I just need to make sure the other products (`a*d`, `b*c`, `b*d`) are not larger.
If I set `b` and `d` to be small or negative numbers, the max will likely be `a*c`.

Let's try:
`a = 56183721947132200`
`b = 0`
`c = 1`
`d = 0`

Calculations:
`a * c` = 56183721947132200 * 1 = 56183721947132200
`a * d` = 56183721947132200 * 0 = 0
`b * c` = 0 * 1 = 0
`b * d` = 0 * 0 = 0

`max(...)` = 56183721947132200. This works.

The input string would be "56183721947132200 0 1 0".

Alternatively, let's verify if the number is a square or product of two similar large integers, which is common in competitive programming test cases involving max products.
`sqrt(56183721947132200) ≈ 237031056.9`
Let's just stick to the simplest integer factorization found above to ensure correctness.

Final check:
Input: "56183721947132200 0 1 0"
`a` = 56183721947132200
`b` = 0
`c` = 1
`d` = 0
Output = 56183721947132200

Another possibility: factorization.
56183721947132200 can be divided by 100 easily.
56,183,721,947,132,200 = 561,837,219,471,322 * 100.
Let `a = 561837219471322`, `b = 0`, `c = 100`, `d = 0`.
Product `a*c` = 56183721947132200.
This also works and uses slightly smaller individual numbers, but the first one is simpler to construct mentally. I will provide the one based on identity.
