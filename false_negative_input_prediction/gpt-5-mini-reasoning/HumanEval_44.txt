[THOUGHT]
The function builds the base representation by repeatedly taking x % base and prepending it. To return "4" the loop must run exactly once producing the single remainder "4" and then x becomes 0. That means the initial x % base == 4 and x //= base yields 0, so x < base and x == 4. Therefore x = 4 and base > 4. The simplest choice is base = 10.
