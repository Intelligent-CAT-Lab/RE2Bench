[THOUGHT]
The output "0b101101110" is the binary representation of the integer 366 (1*2^8 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 = 366).

The function returns bin(round(summation / (m - n + 1))). For consecutive integers n..m the mean equals (n + m) / 2, so round((n + m) / 2) must equal 366.

The simplest choice is to make the average exactly 366, e.g. n = 366 and m = 366:
- The loop sums the single value 366, count = 1.
- Average = 366, round(366) = 366.
- bin(366) -> "0b101101110", matching the output.

So the input is n = 366, m = 366.
