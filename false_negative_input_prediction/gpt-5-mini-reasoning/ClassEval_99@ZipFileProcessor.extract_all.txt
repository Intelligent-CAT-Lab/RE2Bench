False

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
The method extract_all returns False only if an exception is raised in the try block. The try block attempts to open self.file_name as a zipfile for reading and call extractall(output_path). A simple way to cause an exception is to provide a non-existent or invalid zip file name so ZipFile(...) raises FileNotFoundError or a BadZipFile error. Thus plausible input is a missing zip file name and some output path. For example, file_name "missing.zip" (doesn't exist) and output_path "output_dir" will cause ZipFile to raise and the method to return False.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "file_name": "missing.zip"
    },
    "args": {
        "output_path": "output_dir"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
