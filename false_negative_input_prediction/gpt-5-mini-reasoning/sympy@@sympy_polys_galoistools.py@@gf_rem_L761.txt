[THOUGHT]
We need inputs f, g, p, K such that gf_rem(f, g, p, K) returns the remainder [2, 0].

gf_rem simply returns the remainder from gf_div. The gf_div implementation uses coefficient lists in descending (highest-degree-first) order. The remainder length 2 corresponds to a degree-1 polynomial (b1*x + b0) represented as [b1, b0]. So the divisor g must have degree dg >= 2 (remainder degree < dg). Choose dg = 2 so remainder [2,0] is allowed.

A simple way to build f that divides to give that remainder is to pick a quotient q and set f = q*g + r mod p. Choose q = [1] (constant 1) so f = g + r (with r aligned to g by prepending a 0). Let g = [1, 0, 1] (x^2 + 1) and r = [2, 0]. Then padding r to g's length gives [0, 2, 0], so f = [1+0, 0+2, 1+0] = [1, 2, 1].

Pick p = 3 (so coefficients are reduced mod 3). With g[0] = 1, K must support modular inverse of 1 modulo p; the standard domain used in sympy examples is ZZ. Using K = ZZ, invert(1, 3) = 1, and running through gf_div with f = [1,2,1], g = [1,0,1], p = 3 yields quotient [1] and remainder [2,0] (as required). I simulated the algorithm step-by-step and verified the final remainder is [2, 0].

So the predicted input is:
