[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers h and a and prints math.ceil(h / a) which equals 6.

We need integers h, a such that ceil(h / a) = 6. That means:
5 < = h / a <= 6  (more precisely, (h+a-1)//a == 6)
Equivalently, h must satisfy 5*a < h <= 6*a, or integer range 5*a+1 .. 6*a.

Choose a small a to get a simple input. Let a = 2, then h must be in 11..12. Pick h = 11.
ceil(11 / 2) = ceil(5.5) = 6, which matches the output.

So the input should be "11 2".
