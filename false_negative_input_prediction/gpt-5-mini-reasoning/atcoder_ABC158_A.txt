[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single-line input string s and prints 'Yes' iff both characters 'A' and 'B' appear in s. The observed output is "Yes", so the provided input must contain at least one 'A' and at least one 'B'. A minimal such input is "AB" (or "BA"); I'll use "AB".

{
    "input": "AB"
}
