[THOUGHT]
The function computes [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:].
That means the output list corresponds to i * x for indices 1,2,3,... (index 0 term is dropped by [1:]).

The given output is [2, 2, 0, 16], which has length 4, so these are the products for i = 1..4:
- For i=1: 1 * x1 = 2  -> x1 = 2
- For i=2: 2 * x2 = 2  -> x2 = 1
- For i=3: 3 * x3 = 0  -> x3 = 0
- For i=4: 4 * x4 = 16 -> x4 = 4

We also need an x0 (index 0). Its value is multiplied by 0 and then discarded by the [1:] slice, so it can be any number; choose 0 for simplicity.

Therefore xs = [0, 2, 1, 0, 4].
