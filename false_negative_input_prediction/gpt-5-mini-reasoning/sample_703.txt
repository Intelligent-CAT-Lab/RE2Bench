[THOUGHT]
We need text[count:] == "zzv2sg", where count = text.count(char*2).

So text must be some prefix P of length count followed by "zzv2sg": text = P + "zzv2sg", and count equals the number of non-overlapping occurrences of char*2 in the whole text.

One simple solution: pick char = "z" and let P = "z" (a single "z"), so text = "z" + "zzv2sg" = "zzzv2sg".
Compute count = "zzzv2sg".count("zz"). Non-overlapping counting finds one occurrence ("zz" at positions 0-1) because the overlapping second "zz" (positions 1-2) is not counted separately, so count = 1.
Then text[count:] = text[1:] = "zzv2sg", which matches the required output.

Thus a valid input is text = "zzzv2sg", char = "z".
