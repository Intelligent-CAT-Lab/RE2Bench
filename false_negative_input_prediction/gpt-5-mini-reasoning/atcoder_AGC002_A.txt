[THOUGHT]
We need two integers a and b read from input().split().

The program prints:
- "Zero" if a <= 0 and 0 <= b.
- "Negative" if a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0.
- Otherwise "Positive".

To get "Positive" we must make both prior conditions false.

Easiest route: choose a > 0. Then the first condition (a <= 0 and 0 <= b) is false (since a <= 0 is false), and the second condition (requires a < 0) is false as well. So any pair with a positive will produce "Positive".

Pick a simple example: a = 1, b = 1.

Input should be the two integers separated by a space: "1 1".
