[THOUGHT]
The program:
- reads two ints a, b.
- First while loop runs a times, so after it: h = a, s = a.
- Second loop runs while s >= b; each iteration does h += 1 and s = s - b + 1.
This is the standard "exchange" process; total h equals initial a plus number of exchanges. The closed form is:
  h = a + (a - 1) // (b - 1)   (for b > 1)

We need integers a, b > 1 with a + (a - 1)//(b - 1) = 80.

Try b = 3:
  (a - 1)//(b - 1) = (a - 1)//2
Let k = (a - 1)//2. Then a + k = 80 => k = 80 - a.
Solve consistency: k = (a - 1)//2 -> plug a = 80 - k:
  k = (79 - k)//2  -> 2k <= 79 - k < 2k + 2
  => 3k <= 79 and 3k > 77 -> k = 26
Then a = 80 - k = 54.

Verify: a = 54, b = 3:
  h initial = 54, extra = (54 - 1)//2 = 53//2 = 26, total = 54 + 26 = 80.
So input "54 3" produces output 80.
