def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

[THOUGHT]
The function `compare(game, guess)` computes the absolute difference between elements of two iterables `game` and `guess` at corresponding indices.
The output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`. This means the function produced a list of length 4.
This implies `game` and `guess` are iterables (likely lists) of at least length 4.
The relationship for each index `i` is `abs(game[i] - guess[i]) == output[i]`.

We have the following equations:
1. `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`
2. `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0`
3. `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0`
4. `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`

There are infinite integer solutions. We will construct a valid one.
Let's arbitrarily choose `guess` to be `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.
- For index 0: `abs(game[0] - 2) = 2` implies `game[0]` can be `4` or `0`. Let's choose `4`.
- For index 1: `abs(game[1] - 2) = 0` implies `game[1] = 2`.
- For index 2: `abs(game[2] - 2) = 0` implies `game[2] = 2`.
- For index 3: `abs(game[3] - 2) = 1` implies `game[3]` can be `3` or `1`. Let's choose `3`.

So, `game = [4, 2, 2, 3]` and `guess = [2, 2, 2, 2]` is a valid input pair.
