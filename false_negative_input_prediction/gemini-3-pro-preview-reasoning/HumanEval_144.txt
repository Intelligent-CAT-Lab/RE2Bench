[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify(x, n)` takes two inputs, `x` and `n`.
From the lines `a, b = x.split('/')` and `c, d = n.split('/')`, we can deduce that both inputs `x` and `n` must be strings containing exactly one forward slash `/` which separates two values. These values are effectively the numerator and denominator of a fraction representation.

The function then converts these split parts into integers:
`numerator = int(a) * int(c)`
`denom = int(b) * int(d)`

Finally, it checks if `numerator / denom` is equal to `int(numerator / denom)`. This condition is true if `numerator` is perfectly divisible by `denom` (i.e., the result is a whole number). If so, it returns `True`.

The expected output is `True`. Therefore, I need to provide string inputs `x` and `n` such that the product of their first parts (numerators) is divisible by the product of their second parts (denominators).

Let's construct an example:
1. Choose denominators `b` and `d` such that their product is easy to work with, say `b=2` and `d=1`. `denom = 2 * 1 = 2`.
2. Choose numerators `a` and `c` such that their product is divisible by `denom` (2). Let `a=4` and `c=1`. `numerator = 4 * 1 = 4`.
3. Check logic: `4 / 2 = 2.0`. `int(2.0) = 2`. Since `2.0 == 2`, the function returns `True`.

Constructing inputs `x` and `n`:
`x` corresponds to "a/b" -> "4/2"
`n` corresponds to "c/d" -> "1/1"

Another simple example:
x="1/1", n="1/1". num=1, den=1. 1/1=1. True.

I will use `x="4/2"` and `n="1/1"` for the solution.
