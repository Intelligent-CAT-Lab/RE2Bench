[THOUGHT]
The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input. It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n` is even). Inside the loop, it divides `n` by 2. This process effectively removes all factors of 2 from `n`.

After the loop, the code checks if the remaining value of `n` is equal to 1.
- If `n == 1`, it prints 'YES'. This logic identifies if the original number was a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...).
- If `n != 1`, it prints 'NO'. This happens if the original number had any prime factors other than 2.

We are given the output `NO`. This means the input number must *not* be a power of 2. We must also avoid the input 0 because `0 % 2 == 0` is true, and `0 / 2` remains 0, resulting in an infinite loop.

Let's test an integer that is not a power of 2, for example, `3`.
1. `n = 3`.
2. `3 % 2` is 1 (not 0), so the `while` loop is skipped.
3. The condition `if n == 1` checks if `3 == 1`, which is `False`.
4. The `else` block executes, printing 'NO'.

This matches the desired output. Other valid inputs could be 5, 6, 7, etc. I will use `3`.
