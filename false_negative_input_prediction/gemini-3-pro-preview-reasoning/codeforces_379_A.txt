The code snippet provided reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then simulates a process involving two loops.
1.  **First Loop**: It initializes `h` (hours/count) and `s` (supply/stubs) to 0. It sets `x = a` and increments both `h` and `s` by 1, `x` times. Effectively, after this loop, `h = a` and `s = a`. This represents the initial consumption of `a` resources, generating `a` units of output and `a` units of residue (stubs).
2.  **Second Loop**: The condition `while s // b != 0` checks if there are enough stubs `s` to form groups of size `b` (since `s // b > 0` implies `s >= b` for positive integers). Inside the loop:
    *   `h` is incremented by 1 (one new unit generated).
    *   `s` is updated: `b` stubs are removed, and 1 new stub (from the new unit) is added back. Net change to `s` is `-(b - 1)`.
    *   This loop continues until `s < b`.
    *   Effectively, for every `b` stubs, we gain 1 `h` and net lose `b-1` stubs.

This logic calculates the total output $h_{final}$. Mathematically, this can be approximated as $h = a + \lfloor \frac{a - 1}{b - 1} \rfloor$. We are given that the output is **80**. We need to find `a` and `b`.

We look for integer solutions to $h(a, b) = 80$. A key property of this function is that it cannot produce values that are multiples of `b`. Since 80 is our target, `b` cannot be a divisor of 80 (e.g., $b$ cannot be 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, etc.).

Let's test small integers for `b` that do not divide 80:
*   Try **b = 3**:
    The formula becomes $h \approx a + a/2 = 1.5a = 80 \Rightarrow a \approx 53.3$.
    Let's test integer `a = 54`:
    Initial `s = 54`, `h = 54`.
    Loop condition `s >= 3`. In each step `s` decreases by $3-1=2$.
    `s` goes from 54 down to 2 (since 54 is even).
    Number of steps = $(54 - 2) / 2 = 26$.
    Final `h = 54 + 26 = 80`.
    This yields the correct output.

Thus, `a = 54` and `b = 3` is a valid input pair.
