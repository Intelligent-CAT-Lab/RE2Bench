YES

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and creates a tuple `ABC`. It then checks two conditions to print "YES":
1.  `ABC.count(5) == 2`: The number `5` must appear exactly twice in the tuple.
2.  `sum(ABC) == 17`: The sum of all numbers in the tuple must equal `17`.

To reverse-engineer the input:
1.  We need exactly two `5`s in the input list. Let's start with `[5, 5]`.
2.  The sum of these two numbers is `5 + 5 = 10`.
3.  The target sum is `17`, so the remaining numbers in the input must add up to `17 - 10 = 7`.
4.  We can simply use the number `7` as the remaining number. Note that `7` is not `5`, so the count of `5` remains 2.
5.  Combining these, we get the numbers `5`, `5`, and `7`.
6.  Checking the logic: `tuple([5, 5, 7])` has two 5s, and the sum is `5 + 5 + 7 = 17`. This satisfies the condition for printing "YES".
7.  The input string should be these numbers separated by spaces.
