[THOUGHT]
The Python code provided performs the following operations:
1.  Reads a line of input and splits it into two strings, assigned to `a` and `b`.
2.  Transforms string `b` by taking the first character (`b[0]`) and concatenating it with the substring starting from the third character (`b[2:]`). This effectively removes the character at index 1. This specific manipulation is commonly used to parse floating-point numbers formatted like "X.YY" into an integer "XYY" to avoid floating-point errors (e.g., "1.23" becomes "123").
3.  Converts `a` and the transformed `b` into integers.
4.  Calculates `(a * b) // 100` and prints the result. This confirms the logic: it calculates $A \times B_{float}$ using integer arithmetic $A \times (B_{int} / 100)$.

We are given the output `2017634310362021`.
Let $T = 2017634310362021$.
We need to find an input pair $(A, S_B)$ such that:
$B_{converted} = \text{int}(S_B[0] + S_B[2:])$
$(A \times B_{converted}) // 100 = T$

The simplest solution is to assume a multiplier of 1.
If $S_B = "1.00"$:
- `b` starts as "1.00" (index 0 is '1', index 1 is '.', index 2 is '0', index 3 is '0').
- The transformation `b[0] + b[2:]` yields "1" + "00" = "100".
- Converting to int, $B_{converted} = 100$.
- The equation becomes $(A \times 100) // 100 = T$, which simplifies to $A = T$.

So, if we set $A$ to the output value `2017634310362021` and $B$ to `1.00`, the code will produce the exact output required.
Input reconstruction: `2017634310362021 1.00`.
