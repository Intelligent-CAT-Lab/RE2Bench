[THOUGHT]
The function `sum_squares` calculates the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each number in the input list `lst`.
The output is `1086`.
We need to find a list of numbers `lst` such that $\sum (\lceil i \rceil)^2 = 1086$.
For simplicity, we can assume the inputs are integers. If inputs are integers, $\lceil i \rceil = i$.
Then the problem becomes finding a set of integers $\{k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n\}$ such that $\sum k_i^2 = 1086$.

We can use a greedy approach to decompose 1086 into a sum of squares, starting from the largest possible square:
1.  Find the largest integer $x$ such that $x^2 \le 1086$.
    $\sqrt{1086} \approx 32.95$. So, $x_1 = 32$.
    $32^2 = 1024$.
    Remainder: $1086 - 1024 = 62$.

2.  Find the largest integer $x$ such that $x^2 \le 62$.
    $\sqrt{62} \approx 7.87$. So, $x_2 = 7$.
    $7^2 = 49$.
    Remainder: $62 - 49 = 13$.

3.  Find the largest integer $x$ such that $x^2 \le 13$.
    $\sqrt{13} \approx 3.6$. So, $x_3 = 3$.
    $3^2 = 9$.
    Remainder: $13 - 9 = 4$.

4.  Find the largest integer $x$ such that $x^2 \le 4$.
    $x_4 = 2$.
    $2^2 = 4$.
    Remainder: $4 - 4 = 0$.

Decomposition complete. The set of integers is $\{32, 7, 3, 2\}$.
Let's verify: $32^2 + 7^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4 = 1086$.
So, a valid input list is `[32, 7, 3, 2]`.
