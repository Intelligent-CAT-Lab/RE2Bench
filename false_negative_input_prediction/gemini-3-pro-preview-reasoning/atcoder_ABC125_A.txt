[THOUGHT]
The user provides a Python script that reads three integers $A, B, T$ from a single line of input, calculates `ans = T // A * B`, and prints `ans`.
The desired output is `1`.
So, the equation $(T // A) \times B = 1$ must hold.
Since $A, B, T$ are integers (from `map(int, ...)`), the result of integer division $T // A$ is an integer. Thus, we are looking for two integers whose product is 1.
The integer factors of 1 are:
1. $1 \times 1$
2. $-1 \times -1$

Let's assume the standard case where inputs are positive integers.
Then we need:
$B = 1$
$T // A = 1$

The condition $T // A = 1$ implies that $A$ fits into $T$ exactly once. Mathematically, $1 \le T / A < 2$, or $A \le T < 2A$.

We can choose arbitrary values that satisfy these constraints.
Let's choose $A = 10$.
Then $T$ must be between 10 (inclusive) and 20 (exclusive). Let's choose $T = 10$.
We established $B = 1$.

So, $A=10, B=1, T=10$.
Let's verify:
Input string: "10 1 10"
Execution:
`A, B, T = 10, 1, 10`
`ans = 10 // 10 * 1`
`ans = 1 * 1`
`ans = 1`
This matches the desired output.

Another simplified example:
$A=2, B=1, T=2$.
$2 // 2 * 1 = 1$.
Input string: "2 1 2".

I will provide "20 1 20" as a valid input.
