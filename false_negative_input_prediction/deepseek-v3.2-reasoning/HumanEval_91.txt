[THOUGHT]
The function `is_bored` splits the input string `S` into sentences using the regex pattern `[.?!]\s*`, which matches punctuation marks (period, question mark, exclamation) followed by optional whitespace. It then counts how many sentences start exactly with the two characters 'I ' (capital I followed by a space). The output is 0, meaning none of the sentences start with 'I '. To achieve this, we need an input string where no sentence begins with 'I '. The simplest input is an empty string: when `S` is empty, `re.split` returns a list containing one empty string. For the empty string, the condition `sentence[0:2] == 'I '` evaluates to False because slicing an empty string yields an empty string, which is not equal to 'I '. Thus, the sum is 0. Other inputs (e.g., "Hello." or "A. B? C!") would also work, but the empty string is straightforward and satisfies the output.
