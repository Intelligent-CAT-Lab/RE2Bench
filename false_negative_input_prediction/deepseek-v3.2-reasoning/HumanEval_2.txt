[THOUGHT]
The function `truncate_number` returns `number % 1.0`, which is the fractional part of `number`. Given the output is `0.33000000000000007`, we need a `number` such that `number - floor(number) = 0.33000000000000007`. The simplest such number is `0.33000000000000007` itself, because for any number in [0,1), `number % 1.0 = number`. Additionally, any `number` of the form `n + 0.33000000000000007` where `n` is an integer would also work, provided that the sum is exactly representable as a float and the modulo operation yields exactly `0.33000000000000007`. To minimize complexity, we choose `number = 0.33000000000000007`.
