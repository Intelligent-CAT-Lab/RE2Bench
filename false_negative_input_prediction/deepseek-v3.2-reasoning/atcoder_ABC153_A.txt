[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers h and a from input, computes math.ceil(h/a), and prints the result. The given output is 6, so math.ceil(h/a) = 6. This means h/a is in the interval (5, 6]. Since h and a are positive integers, we have 5a < h ≤ 6a. Many pairs (h, a) satisfy this. Without additional constraints, a simple choice is a = 1, which gives h = 6. Thus, the input string "6 1" would produce the output 6.
