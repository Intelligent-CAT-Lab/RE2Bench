[THOUGHT]
We need to find an input list `lst` for which `sum_squares(lst)` returns 1086. The function computes the sum of squares of the ceiling of each element in the list. So we need a list such that the sum of (ceil(i)**2) over all elements i equals 1086. We can try to express 1086 as a sum of perfect squares. 1086 is not a perfect square itself. Checking sums of two squares: there are no integer pairs (a, b) such that a^2 + b^2 = 1086. Trying sums of three squares, we find 31^2 = 961, 10^2 = 100, and 5^2 = 25, and 961 + 100 + 25 = 1086. Therefore, a list containing numbers whose ceilings are 31, 10, and 5 will work. The simplest choice is to use the integers themselves: [31, 10, 5], because ceil(31) = 31, ceil(10) = 10, and ceil(5) = 5. Their squares sum to 961 + 100 + 25 = 1086. This yields the desired output. Other combinations or longer lists are possible, but this is a concise and valid input.
