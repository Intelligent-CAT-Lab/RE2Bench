[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers t and h from input. It computes (h-2) // (t-1) + 1 and prints it. The output is given as 2. So we need (h-2) // (t-1) + 1 = 2, which simplifies to (h-2) // (t-1) = 1. This integer division equality means that the quotient of (h-2) divided by (t-1) is exactly 1, so (h-2) must be at least (t-1) and less than 2*(t-1), assuming (t-1) > 0. The simplest positive integer solution is t=2 and h=3, because (3-2)=1 and (2-1)=1, so 1//1=1, then 1+1=2. Other solutions exist (e.g., t=3, h=4), but this is the minimal one.
