[THOUGHT]
The function returns the largest divisor of n less than n. It iterates i from n-1 down to 1 and returns the first i that divides n. The given output is 1, meaning that the function returned 1. This happens if and only if no divisor is found in the range from 2 to n-1, so the divisor 1 is returned. This is the case when n is a prime number greater than 1 (since n=1 would cause a ZeroDivisionError). Therefore, n must be a prime number. The smallest such prime is 2. So we can choose n=2.
