[THOUGHT]
The extract_all method attempts to open a zip file with the given file_name and extract its contents to output_path. If any exception occurs during this process, it returns False. Given the output is false, an exception must have been raised. This could be due to the zip file not existing, being invalid, or issues with the output path. For simplicity, we can choose a file_name that does not exist, ensuring a FileNotFoundError. The output_path can be any directory string; here we use "./output" as a plausible path. Thus, with file_name = "nonexistent.zip" and output_path = "./output", the method will fail and return False.
