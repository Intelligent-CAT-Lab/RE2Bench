The code snippet is:
```
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
ans = N // (A + B) * A
rem = N % (A + B)
ans += min(rem, A)
print(ans)
```
The code snippet is a solution to the problem where we are given three integers N, A, and B, and we need to compute the maximum number of items that can be sold in N days, given that each day we can sell A items and we need B days to recover after selling A items.
The code snippet first computes the maximum number of items that can be sold in N days, given that each day we can sell A items and we need B days to recover after selling A items.
The code snippet then computes the remainder of the number of days, given that each day we can sell A items and we need B days to recover after selling A items.
The code snippet then computes the maximum number of items that can be sold in N days, given that each day we can sell A items and we need B days to recover after selling A items.
The code snippet then prints the maximum number of items that can be sold in N days, given that each day we can sell A items and we need B days to recover after selling A items.
