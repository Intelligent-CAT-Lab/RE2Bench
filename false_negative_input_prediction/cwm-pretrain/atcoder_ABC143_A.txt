Let's carefully analyze the execution and predict the input that would produce the given output of `0`.

We have the following function:

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())
ans = A - 2 * B
if ans < 0:
    ans = 0
print(ans)
```

And the output is `0`.

Let's go through the logic:

1. We read two integers `A` and `B` from the input.
2. We compute `ans = A - 2 * B`.
3. If `ans < 0`, we set `ans = 0`.
4. Finally, we print `ans`.

Given that the final output is `0`, there are two possibilities:
- The actual value of `ans` after computation is `0`, so it wasn't modified.
- The value of `ans` was negative, so it was set to `0`.

Let's analyze both scenarios.

**Case 1: `ans = 0` without modification**

In this case, we have:
```
A - 2 * B == 0
A = 2 * B
```

This could happen for many different pairs of values, for example:
- `A = 2, B = 1`
- `A = 4, B = 2`
- `A = 6, B = 3`
- etc.

Any pair where `A = 2 * B` would produce the correct output.

**Case 2: `ans < 0` initially and was set to `0`**

In this case, we have:
```
A - 2 * B < 0
A < 2 * B
```

Again, many possible pairs would satisfy this condition, for example:
- `A = 1, B = 1`
- `A = 2, B = 2`
- `A = 3, B = 2`
- etc.

The input could be any pair of integers that satisfies either condition.

To provide a concrete example, let's choose a simple solution:
- `A = 2, B = 1`

This would satisfy:
```
A - 2 * B = 2 - 2 = 0
```

And produce the output `0`.

Now, let's print the predicted input following the requested format:

<think>

From the code execution logic and the condition that `ans = 0`, we can infer that either `A - 2 * B == 0` or `A - 2 * B < 0` (and was set to 0). 

A concrete example that would work is `A = 2` and `B = 1`.

This satisfies `A - 2 * B = 2 - 2 = 0`, producing the output 0.

Therefore, the input that would produce the output is `2 1`.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "2 1"
}
```
[/INPUT]

Now, I'll wait for your response to determine if you'd like me to explain the solution further or if you have a different input to test.
