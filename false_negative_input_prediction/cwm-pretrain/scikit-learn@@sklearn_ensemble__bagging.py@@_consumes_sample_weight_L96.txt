<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

Given the provided functions and the function `_consumes_sample_weight`, we need to reason through the following steps to predict the input that would yield the given output (`false`). The output indicates that the estimator does not consume `sample_weight`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. The function `_consumes_sample_weight(estimator)` first checks if metadata routing is enabled by calling `_routing_enabled()`. This function checks the `get_config()` for the key `"enable_metadata_routing"` and returns `False` if the key is not set.
2. If routing is enabled, the function uses `get_routing_for_object(estimator)` to determine if `sample_weight` is consumed during the `fit` method by calling `consumes('fit', ('sample_weight',))`.
3. If routing is not enabled, it falls back to checking `has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight')`, which determines if the `fit` method of the estimator has `sample_weight` as a parameter.

Given that the output is `false`, we can conclude the following:
- Either routing is not enabled, and `has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight')` returns `false`.
- Or routing is enabled, and `consumes('fit', ('sample_weight',))` returns an empty set or does not include `'sample_weight'`.

### Predicting the Input:
To get `false` as the output:
- The estimator should not have `sample_weight` as a parameter in its `fit` method.
- Or, if routing is enabled, the estimator should not consume `sample_weight` during the `fit` method.

Assuming routing is not enabled (which is the default), we need an estimator whose `fit` method does not include `sample_weight` as a parameter.

### Example Estimator:
An example could be `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `SVC(kernel='linear')`, which do not support `sample_weight` in their `fit` methods.
