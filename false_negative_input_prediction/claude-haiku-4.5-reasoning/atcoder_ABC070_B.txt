[THOUGHT]
The code reads four integers a, b, c, d and prints: `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))`

The output is 0, so we need: `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)) = 0`

This expression calculates the length of the overlap between two intervals [a,b] and [c,d]. The result is 0 when:
- The intervals don't overlap (min(b,d) < max(a,c)), or
- The intervals just touch at a point (min(b,d) = max(a,c))

For a simple example with non-overlapping intervals [1,2] and [3,4]:
- a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4
- max(a, c) = max(1, 3) = 3
- min(b, d) = min(2, 4) = 2
- min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 2 - 3 = -1
- max(0, -1) = 0 ✓

So the input would be: "1 2 3 4"
