[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```

The function returns `True` if and only if both conditions are satisfied:
1. `n % 2 == 0` - n is even (divisible by 2 with remainder 0)
2. `n >= 8` - n is greater than or equal to 8

Since the output is `true`, both conditions must be true.

So I need:
- n is an even number
- n >= 8

The simplest value that satisfies both conditions is `n = 8`:
- `8 % 2 == 0` → `True`
- `8 >= 8` → `True`
- `True and True` → `True` ✓

Any even number >= 8 would work (8, 10, 12, 14, ...), but 8 is the minimal valid input.
