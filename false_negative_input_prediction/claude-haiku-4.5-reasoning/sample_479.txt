[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function backwards to find what input produces the output [1, 2, 3].

The function:
1. Calls `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)` - removes an element at index `pop1 - 1`
2. Calls `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)` - removes an element at index `pop2 - 1` from the already-modified list
3. Returns the resulting list

The output is [1, 2, 3], which means two elements were removed from the original list.

Since 2 elements are removed, the original list must have had 5 elements.

The simplest case would be:
- Original: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- We want to end up with [1, 2, 3]
- This means we need to remove 0 and 4

Step-by-step verification:
- Initial state: nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- First pop: nums.pop(pop1 - 1)
  - If pop1 = 1, then pop(0) removes the element at index 0 (which is 0)
  - List becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Second pop: nums.pop(pop2 - 1) 
  - If pop2 = 4, then pop(3) removes the element at index 3 (which is 4)
  - List becomes: [1, 2, 3] ✓

This produces the correct output!
