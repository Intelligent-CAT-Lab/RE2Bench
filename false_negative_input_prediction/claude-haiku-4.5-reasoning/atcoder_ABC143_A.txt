[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code backwards from the output:

1. The code reads two integers A and B from input
2. It calculates: `ans = A - 2 * B`
3. If `ans < 0`, it sets `ans = 0`
4. It prints `ans`

The output is `0`.

For the output to be 0, either:
- Case 1: `A - 2*B = 0` (so ans stays 0), which means `A = 2*B`
- Case 2: `A - 2*B < 0` (so ans becomes 0 after the if statement), which means `A < 2*B`

Both cases are valid. Let me work with a simple example:
- If A = 0 and B = 0: ans = 0 - 2(0) = 0, which outputs 0 ✓
- If A = 0 and B = 1: ans = 0 - 2(1) = -2, then ans becomes 0, which outputs 0 ✓

Either would work. I'll use the simplest case: A = 0, B = 0, which gives ans = 0 directly.
