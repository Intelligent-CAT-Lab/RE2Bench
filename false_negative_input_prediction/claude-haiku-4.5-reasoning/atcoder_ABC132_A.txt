[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code to understand what input would produce "Yes" as output.

The code does:
1. `s = sorted(input())` - reads a string and sorts it alphabetically
2. Checks: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[2] == s[3] and (s[0] != s[2])`
3. If all three conditions are true, prints "Yes"

Since the output is "Yes", all three conditions must be true:
- `s[0] == s[1]` - the first two characters of the sorted string are the same
- `s[2] == s[3]` - the third and fourth characters of the sorted string are the same  
- `s[0] != s[2]` - the character at position 0 is different from the character at position 2

This means the sorted string must look like: `[c1, c1, c2, c2, ...]` where `c1 != c2`

For example, if the sorted string is `['a', 'a', 'b', 'b']`:
- `s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'a'` → Equal ✓
- `s[2] = 'b', s[3] = 'b'` → Equal ✓
- `'a' != 'b'` → Different ✓

The original input could be any permutation of two distinct characters, each appearing at least twice. A simple example is "aabb".

Verification:
- `s = sorted("aabb") = ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b']`
- `s[0] == s[1]` → `'a' == 'a'` → True
- `s[2] == s[3]` → `'b' == 'b'` → True
- `s[0] != s[2]` → `'a' != 'b'` → True
- All conditions true → Output: "Yes" ✓
