100

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `heal` method:

1. The method adds 10 to `self.hp`
2. If the resulting `self.hp` > 100, it caps it to 100
3. Returns the final `self.hp`

Given output: 100

For the output to be 100, `self.hp` after the heal operation must be 100. This can happen when:
- `hp` before healing is any value from 90 to 100
- After adding 10: if hp ≥ 90, then hp + 10 ≥ 100
- If hp < 100: hp + 10 could be ≤ 100 (exactly 100 if hp = 90), or > 100 (gets capped to 100)
- If hp = 100: 100 + 10 = 110, capped to 100

A reasonable input would be `hp = 95` (character is injured but not critical):
- 95 + 10 = 105
- 105 > 100, so hp gets capped to 100
- Returns 100 ✓

Other character attributes don't affect the output, so I'll use reasonable RPG values:
- name: "Warrior" (typical character name)
- attack_power: 20 (reasonable stat)
- defense: 10 (reasonable stat)
- level: 1 (default)
- exp: 0 (default)
