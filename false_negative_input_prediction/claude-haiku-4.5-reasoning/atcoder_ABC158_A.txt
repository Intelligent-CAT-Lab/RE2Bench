[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code with the given output:

1. `stdin = input()` - reads a string from input
2. `s = stdin` - assigns the input to variable s
3. `result = 'Yes' if 'A' in s and 'B' in s else 'No'` - this line checks:
   - If 'A' is in s AND 'B' is in s, then result = 'Yes'
   - Otherwise result = 'No'
4. `print(result)` - prints the result

Given that the output is "Yes", this means the condition `'A' in s and 'B' in s` must evaluate to True.

This requires:
- The character 'A' must be present in the input string
- The character 'B' must be present in the input string

The simplest input that satisfies both conditions would be a string containing both 'A' and 'B', such as "AB".

Let me verify:
- stdin = "AB"
- s = "AB"
- 'A' in "AB" = True
- 'B' in "AB" = True
- True and True = True
- result = 'Yes'
- print("Yes") ✓
