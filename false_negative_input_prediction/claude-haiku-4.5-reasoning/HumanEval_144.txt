[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `simplify` function with the output being `true`:

The function returns `True` when the condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is satisfied. This condition checks if the division result is a whole number (no decimal part).

Working backwards:
- The output is `true`, meaning the if condition was True
- This means `numerator / denom` must be a whole number
- The simplest case would be when `numerator` and `denom` are equal, or when `numerator` is divisible by `denom`

For example, if I use:
- `x = "1/1"` and `n = "1/1"`
- Then: a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1
- numerator = 1 * 1 = 1
- denom = 1 * 1 = 1
- numerator / denom = 1 / 1 = 1.0
- int(numerator / denom) = int(1.0) = 1
- 1.0 == 1 is True in Python
- Function returns True ✓

Alternatively, other valid inputs could be:
- `x = "2/1"` and `n = "1/2"` → 2*1 / (1*2) = 2/2 = 1.0 = 1 ✓
- `x = "4/2"` and `n = "1/2"` → 4*1 / (2*2) = 4/4 = 1.0 = 1 ✓

The simplest solution is "1/1" and "1/1".
