[THOUGHT]
Let me work through this step by step.

The function `sum_squares` does the following:
1. For each element `i` in the input list `lst`
2. Applies `math.ceil(i)` to get the ceiling value
3. Squares that ceiling value
4. Adds all these squared values together
5. Returns the total

Given that the output is 1086, I need to find what list elements, when ceiling-ed and squared, sum to 1086.

Let me decompose 1086 into a sum of perfect squares:
- 1086 = 1024 + 62
- 1024 = 32²
- 62 = 49 + 13 = 7² + 13
- 13 = 9 + 4 = 3² + 2²

So: 1086 = 32² + 7² + 3² + 2² = 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4

Let me verify:
- 1024 + 49 = 1073
- 1073 + 9 = 1082
- 1082 + 4 = 1086 ✓

Therefore, if the input list contains values that ceil to [32, 7, 3, 2], we get the desired output. The simplest case is using exact integers: [2, 3, 7, 32]

Execution trace:
- squared = 0
- i = 2: squared += ceil(2)² = 0 + 4 = 4
- i = 3: squared += ceil(3)² = 4 + 9 = 13
- i = 7: squared += ceil(7)² = 13 + 49 = 62
- i = 32: squared += ceil(32)² = 62 + 1024 = 1086 ✓
