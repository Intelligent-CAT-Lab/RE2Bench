[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce the output {"87": 7, "18": 6}.

The function:
1. Sorts dictionary items by key (as strings) in reverse/descending order
2. Takes the first (largest) key and pops its value → key1, val1
3. Sorts the remaining items in reverse order
4. Takes the first (largest remaining) key and pops its value → key2, val2  
5. Returns {key1: val1, key2: val2}

Given output {"87": 7, "18": 6}, this means:
- key1 = "87" with val1 = 7
- key2 = "18" with val2 = 6

For this to occur with string sorting (reverse/descending):
- "87" must be the largest key initially
- "18" must be the largest remaining after "87" is removed

Verifying string comparison:
- "87" vs "18": Compare first characters '8' (ASCII 56) vs '1' (ASCII 49) → '8' > '1', so "87" > "18" ✓
- "87" vs "2": '8' (56) vs '2' (50) → '8' > '2', so "87" > "2" ✓
- "18" vs "16": First chars match ('1' = '1'), compare '8' vs '6' → '8' > '6', so "18" > "16" ✓
- "18" vs "17": First chars match ('1' = '1'), compare '8' vs '7' → '8' > '7', so "18" > "17" ✓
- "2" vs "18": '2' (50) vs '1' (49) → '2' > '1', so "2" > "18" ✗

If the structure had only keys "2", "17", "16":
- Sorted descending: ["2", "17", "16"] (since "2" > "17" > "16")
- This would give output {"2": val, "17": val}, not the required {"87": 7, "18": 6}

Therefore, the input must contain keys "87" and "18". The third key must be ≤ "18" in string comparison. I can use "16" with any value (since it won't appear in output). Let's use value 5 for the third key.

Input: {"87": 7, "18": 6, "16": 5}

Verification:
- Sorted descending: ["87", "18", "16"]
- Pop first: key1="87", val1=7
- Remaining: {"18": 6, "16": 5}, sorted: ["18", "16"]
- Pop first: key2="18", val2=6
- Return: {"87": 7, "18": 6} ✓
