[THOUGHT]
The function `add(x, y)` simply returns the sum of x and y: `return x + y`.

Given that the output is 1223, we need to find values for x and y such that:
```
x + y = 1223
```

Since there are infinitely many valid combinations of x and y that satisfy this equation, I need to choose a reasonable pair. Without additional constraints or context, any valid combination works. 

A natural choice would be to split 1223 approximately in half:
1223 / 2 = 611.5

So I can choose:
- x = 611
- y = 612

Verification: 611 + 612 = 1223 ✓

This gives us two consecutive integers that sum to the expected output.
