<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
For the `write_csv` method to return 1 (success), the try block must execute without raising any exception. This requires:

1. `file_name` must be a valid file path string where the file can be opened and written to (e.g., "output.csv")
2. `data` must be an iterable that can be passed to `csv.writer.writerows()` - typically a list of lists or list of tuples (e.g., `[["col1", "col2"], ["val1", "val2"]]`)

When both parameters are valid and the file I/O succeeds without error, the function returns 1. Multiple valid inputs could produce this same output, so providing a realistic example that would successfully write a CSV file makes sense here.
