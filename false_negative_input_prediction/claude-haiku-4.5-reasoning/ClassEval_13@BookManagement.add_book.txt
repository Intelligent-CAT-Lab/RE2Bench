[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze this step by step.

The `add_book` method:
1. Takes a `title` parameter and an optional `quantity` parameter (default=1)
2. If the title already exists in inventory, it adds the quantity to the existing count
3. If the title is new, it creates a new entry with that quantity
4. The method has no explicit return statement, so it returns `None` (which appears as `null` in JSON)

The output is `null`, which is consistent with ANY call to `add_book` since the method always returns `None` regardless of input.

Looking at the structure provided:
- `self.inventory` already contains entries for "book1" and "book2"
- A `title` parameter is being passed to add_book
- No additional keyword arguments are being used (quantity uses the default value of 1)

Since the output doesn't constrain the input (all calls return null), I need to provide reasonable values:

For the inventory state before calling add_book:
- book1 needs a quantity value
- book2 needs a quantity value
- These could be any positive integers representing prior inventory levels

For the title being added:
- It could be "book1" (adding to existing inventory)
- It could be "book2" (adding to existing inventory)
- Or theoretically any other title

A reasonable scenario:
- Initial inventory: {"book1": 1, "book2": 1}
- Call: add_book("book1") with default quantity=1
- Result: inventory becomes {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}, and the method returns null
