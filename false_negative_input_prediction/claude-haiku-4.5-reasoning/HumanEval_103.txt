[THOUGHT]

Let me work backwards from the output to find the input values.

The output is `"0b101101110"`, which is a binary string representation.

First, let me convert this binary to decimal:
- `0b101101110` = 1×2⁸ + 0×2⁷ + 1×2⁶ + 1×2⁵ + 0×2⁴ + 1×2³ + 1×2² + 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰
- = 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 366

So the function must return `bin(366)`, which means `round(summation / (m - n + 1))` must equal 366.

Now, I need to understand what average would round to 366:
- The summation of integers from n to m is: sum = (m - n + 1) × (n + m) / 2
- The average is: sum / (m - n + 1) = (n + m) / 2

For Python's round() with banker's rounding to give 366:
- round(365.5) = 366
- round(366.0) = 366  
- round(366.5) = 366

So the average should satisfy approximately: 365.5 ≤ (n + m) / 2 ≤ 366.5

This means: 731 ≤ n + m ≤ 733

Let me try n = 1 and m = 731:
- n + m = 732
- Average = 732 / 2 = 366.0
- round(366.0) = 366 ✓
- Summation = 731 × 732 / 2 = 267,546
- Count = 731 - 1 + 1 = 731
- Average = 267,546 / 731 = 366.0
- bin(366) = '0b101101110' ✓

Also need to verify m ≥ n: 731 ≥ 1 ✓

This is a natural and clean test case!
