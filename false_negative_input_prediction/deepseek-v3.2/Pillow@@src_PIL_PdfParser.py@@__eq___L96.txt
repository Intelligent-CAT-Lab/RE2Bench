__eq__

class IndirectReference(IndirectReferenceTuple):

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other.__class__ is self.__class__ and other.object_id == self.object_id and (other.generation == self.generation)

{'self': {}, 'args': {'other': [1, 2]}, 'kwargs': {}}

<<GROUND_TRUTH_OUTPUT>>

False

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

Let's reason through the problem step by step.

The `IndirectReference` class's `__eq__` method is defined to return `True` only if:  
- `other.__class__ is self.__class__` (same class, not just subclass)  
- `other.object_id == self.object_id`  
- `other.generation == self.generation`  

The output given is `false`, meaning at least one of those three conditions failed.

Possible failure cases:
1. `other` is not the exact same class as `self` (could be a subclass or different class).
2. `other.object_id` is different.
3. `other.generation` is different.

We only need to provide one possible `other` that makes the equality return `false`.  
Since `self` is unspecified in the input structure (`"self": {}`), we can choose `self` arbitrarily, but we need to choose `other` so that at least one condition fails.

For simplicity, I'll pick:
- `self` has `object_id = 1`, `generation = 0`, class `IndirectReference`.  
- `other` could be a different class (e.g., `tuple`) or same class with a different `object_id` or `generation`.

The easiest is to make `other` be a completely different type so the first condition fails immediately.

Thus: `other` is not an `IndirectReference`.

Let's choose `other = None` (or any object of a different class). That will cause `other.__class__ is self.__class__` to be false.

So final input: `other = None`.

[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method returns `False` if `other` is not exactly the same class as `self`, or if `object_id` or `generation` differ. Given output is `False`, I'll choose `other` as `None`, which fails the class check immediately.
