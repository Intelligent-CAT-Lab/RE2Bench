<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

We're given output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]  
Function `rescale_to_unit` normalizes a list so smallest becomes 0, largest becomes 1, and others are linearly scaled.  

Output length = 5, so input list length = 5.  
Let original list be [a, b, c, d, e] after sorting. We know min_number = a, max_number = e.  

Given output:  
1st: 0.0 → (a - a)/(e - a) = 0 → correct.  
2nd: 0.25 → (b - a)/(e - a) = 0.25 → b - a = 0.25 * (e - a)  
3rd: 0.5 → (c - a)/(e - a) = 0.5 → c - a = 0.5 * (e - a)  
4th: 0.75 → (d - a)/(e - a) = 0.75 → d - a = 0.75 * (e - a)  
5th: 1.0 → (e - a)/(e - a) = 1 → correct.  

The differences between consecutive values in output are 0.25, meaning the original numbers were equally spaced in original scale.  

If original numbers equally spaced:  
Let a = m, b = m + r, c = m + 2r, d = m + 3r, e = m + 4r.  

Then range = e - a = 4r.  
Then second normalized: (m + r - m) / (4r) = r / (4r) = 0.25 ✅  
third normalized: (2r)/(4r) = 0.5 ✅  
fourth normalized: (3r)/(4r) = 0.75 ✅  

So any equally spaced 5 numbers will give this output.  
Simplest: m = 0, r = 1 → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  
Check: min=0, max=4, normalized:  
[0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4] = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] ✅  

Thus possible input: numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (or any linear shift/scaling). But the problem says “predict the input” not “find all possible inputs” — simplest is fine.
