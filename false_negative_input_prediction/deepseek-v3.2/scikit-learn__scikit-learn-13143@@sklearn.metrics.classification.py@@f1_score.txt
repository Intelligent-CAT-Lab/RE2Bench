def f1_score(y_true, y_pred, labels=None, pos_label=1, average='binary',
             sample_weight=None):
    """Compute the F1 score, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure

    The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and
    recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.
    The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are
    equal. The formula for the F1 score is::

        F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

    In the multi-class and multi-label case, this is the average of
    the F1 score of each class with weighting depending on the ``average``
    parameter.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           parameter *labels* improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : string, [None, 'binary' (default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', \
                       'weighted']
        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    f1_score : float or array of float, shape = [n_unique_labels]
        F1 score of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the F1 scores of each class for the multiclass task.

0.5333333333333333

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
The output is a single F1 score value: 0.5333333333333333. Since the function `f1_score` calls `fbeta_score` with `beta=1`, I need to think about what inputs would produce this F1 score.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as:
F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

Given the output is 0.5333..., which is exactly 8/15 (since 8/15 ≈ 0.5333), I need to find values that would produce this result.

Looking at the signature, the function can handle different averaging methods:
- 'binary' for binary classification
- 'micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 'samples' for multiclass

Since the output is a single scalar, and the structure suggests `average` is a parameter, I need to determine what averaging method was used.

The value 0.5333 suggests this might be a weighted average or macro average of multiple classes, or it could be a binary classification result.

Let me think about possible precision/recall combinations that would give F1 = 8/15:
2 * (P * R) / (P + R) = 8/15
=> 30 * P * R = 8 * (P + R)
=> 30PR - 8P - 8R = 0

This is symmetric in P and R, so P = R would give:
2 * P² / (2P) = P = 8/15 ≈ 0.5333

So if precision = recall = 8/15, we get F1 = 8/15.

For binary classification, this could be achieved with:
- TP = 8, FP = 7, FN = 7 (precision = 8/15, recall = 8/15)

For multiclass, this could be an average of multiple F1 scores.

Given the structure shows `y_true` and `y_pred` as arrays, and the output is a single number, I'll assume binary classification with `average='binary'`.

Let me construct example arrays that would give these results:
y_true = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  (8 ones, 7 zeros)
y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  (14 ones, 1 zero)

This gives:
- TP = 8 (correctly predicted ones)
- FP = 6 (zeros predicted as ones)  
- FN = 0 (ones predicted correctly)
- TN = 1 (zero predicted as zero)

Wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Let me recompute:

With my example:
- TP = 8 (all actual ones correctly predicted)
- FP = 6 (6 actual zeros predicted as ones) 
- FN = 0 (no actual ones predicted as zeros)
- TN = 1 (1 actual zero correctly predicted as zero)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 8 / (8 + 6) = 8/14 ≈ 0.5714
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 8 / (8 + 0) = 1
F1 = 2 * (0.5714 * 1) / (0.5714 + 1) ≈ 0.7273

That's not 0.5333. Let me try a different approach.

I need precision = recall = 8/15 ≈ 0.5333, so:
TP / (TP + FP) = 8/15 and TP / (TP + FN) = 8/15

This means:
TP + FP = (15/8) * TP and TP + FN = (15/8) * TP

So FP = (7/8) * TP and FN = (7/8) * TP

If I take TP = 8, then FP = 7 and FN = 7.

So the confusion matrix would be:
- TP = 8
- FP = 7  
- FN = 7
- TN = ? (doesn't affect precision/recall/F1 for positive class in binary classification)

So for binary classification with pos_label=1:
y_true = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1]  (15 ones and 7 zeros? Wait, let me count properly)

Actually, let me construct it systematically:
- We need 8 true positives (actual=1, predicted=1)
- We need 7 false positives (actual=0, predicted=1)  
- We need 7 false negatives (actual=1, predicted=0)

So total actual ones = TP + FN = 8 + 7 = 15
Total actual zeros = FP + TN = 7 + ? (TN doesn't matter for F1)

For the arrays:
y_true should have 15 ones and at least 7 zeros (but zeros could be more if we have TN)
y_pred should have 8+7=15 ones (TP+FP) and 7+? zeros (FN+TN)

A simple construction:
y_true = [1]*15 + [0]*7  (15 ones, 7 zeros)  
y_pred = [1]*8 + [0]*7 + [1]*7  (8 ones, then 7 zeros, then 7 ones)

But this gives:
- TP = 8 (first 8 ones correctly predicted as ones)
- FN = 7 (next 7 ones predicted as zeros)  
- FP = 7 (last 7 zeros predicted as ones)
- TN = 0 (no zeros correctly predicted as zeros)

This matches our requirements exactly.

Let me verify:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 8 / (8 + 7) = 8/15 ≈ 0.5333
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 8 / (8 + 7) = 8/15 ≈ 0.5333  
F1 = 2 * (8/15 * 8/15) / (8/15 + 8/15) = 2 * (64/225) / (16/15) = (128/225) * (15/16) = 8/15 ≈ 0.5333

Perfect! So for binary classification, this would work.

For the kwargs, `average` should be 'binary' (the default).
