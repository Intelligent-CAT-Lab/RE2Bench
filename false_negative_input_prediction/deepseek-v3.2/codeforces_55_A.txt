<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

The code reads an integer `n`, then repeatedly divides it by 2 while it is even.  
If after this process `n` becomes 1, it prints `"YES"` (meaning the original number was a power of two).  
Otherwise, it prints `"NO"`.  

Given the output is `"NO"`, the final `n` after the loop is not 1.  
That means the original number was not a power of 2.  

We need to choose **any integer** that is not a power of two.  
Let's pick a simple example: 3.  

Check:  
- `n = 3`  
- while loop condition `3 % 2 == 0` → false  
- `n == 1` → false → print `"NO"`  

Matches output.  

We’ll use `3`.
