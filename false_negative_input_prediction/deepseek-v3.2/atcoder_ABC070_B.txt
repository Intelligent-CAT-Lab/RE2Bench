Let's analyze the code step by step.  

The code reads four integers:  
```python
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
```  

Then it computes:  
```python
max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))
```  

This is a common formula for the length of overlap between two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` on the number line (or 0 if they don't overlap).  

Given that the output is `0`, we have:  
```
max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c)) = 0
```  

That means:  
`min(b, d) - max(a, c) <= 0`.  

Equivalently, `min(b, d) <= max(a, c)`.  

This happens when intervals do **not** overlap at all (they may just touch if `min(b, d) == max(a, c)`, but the result would still be 0 because `min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 0` and then `max(0, 0) = 0`).  

A simple example:  
Let `a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4`. Then `min(2,4)=2`, `max(1,3)=3`, `2-3 = -1`, `max(0,-1)=0`.  

So an example input string could be: `"1 2 3 4"` — but there are many possible inputs.  

Any `a,b,c,d` such that `b <= c` or `d <= a` will work.  

For simplicity, choose `a=0, b=5, c=6, d=10`.  
Then `min(5,10)=5`, `max(0,6)=6`, `5-6=-1`, `max(0,-1)=0`.  

Let's pick `"0 5 6 10"`.  

[THOUGHT]
The code takes four integers a, b, c, d representing intervals [a,b] and [c,d]. The output formula computes the length of their intersection: min(b,d) - max(a,c), or 0 if negative. An output of 0 means min(b,d) ≤ max(a,c). So the intervals do not overlap (or just touch). Example: a=0, b=5, c=6, d=10 gives output 0. Another possible input is 1 2 3 4. I'll choose 0 5 6 10 as a valid input.
