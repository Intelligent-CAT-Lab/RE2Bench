Let’s reason through step by step.

---

The Python code:

```python
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
ans = N // (A + B) * A
rem = N % (A + B)
ans += min(rem, A)
print(ans)
```

We are told the output is `0`.  
That means `ans` ends up being `0`.

---

**Step 1 — First part of ans**  
`ans = N // (A + B) * A`  
If `N // (A + B)` is `0`, then `ans` starts at `0`. That requires  
`N < (A + B)`  
so that integer division yields `0`.

---

**Step 2 — Second part of ans**  
`rem = N % (A + B)`  
Since `N < A + B` from step 1, `rem = N`.  
Then `ans += min(rem, A)`.  
For final `ans` to be `0`, we need `min(rem, A)` to be `0`.

`min(N, A) = 0` means `N` could be `0` or `A` could be `0`.

---

**Step 3 — Check possibilities**  
1. If `N = 0`:  
   Then first part `N // (A + B) = 0`, `rem = N = 0`, `min(0, A) = 0`.  
   Output is `0` regardless of `A` and `B`.  

2. If `A = 0`:  
   Then first part `N // (0 + B) * 0 = 0`.  
   `rem = N % B`. `min(rem, 0) = 0`.  
   Output is `0` regardless of `N` and `B`.  

Either works, but we need to pick a concrete integer triple `(N, A, B)`.

---

**Step 4 — Example inputs that give output 0**  
Simplest: `N=0, A=5, B=3` → `ans = 0 // 8 * 5 = 0`, `rem=0`, `min(0,5)=0` → final `0`.  

Also `N=2, A=0, B=5` → `ans = 2 // 5 * 0 = 0`, `rem=2`, `min(2,0)=0` → final `0`.  

---

The problem says "predict the input" given the output `0`. Since the code just prints an integer, any triple meeting the above conditions works.  
We can choose the simplest: `0 1 1` → `A=1,B=1,A+B=2`, `N < 2` and `min(N,A)=min(0,1)=0`.  

Check: `N=0,A=1,B=1`:  
`0 // 2 * 1 = 0`, `rem=0`, `min(0,1)=0`, total `0` ✅.

---

**Step 5 — Write final answer**  
Input format: `N A B` as space-separated integers.  

So `"0 1 1"` is fine.

[THOUGHT]
The code calculates the total number of "A wins" in repeated cycles of length (A+B), where in each cycle A occurs A times, B occurs B times. It first counts full cycles, then handles the remainder. For output to be 0, either N is 0 (no cycles at all), or A is 0 (no A wins even in remainder), or N < A+B and N <= 0 (contradiction unless N=0). Simplest satisfying triple: N=0, A=1, B=1. That yields ans = 0//2*1=0, rem=0, min(0,1)=0 → final 0.
