{'sample_weight': [1], 'metadata': 'a'}

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

Let's reason through step by step.

We have the output of `_route_params` as:
```
{
    "sample_weight": [1],
    "metadata": "a"
}
```

This is a `Bunch` object returned as `res`.  

Looking at the `_route_params` method:  

1. `self._check_warnings(params=params)` is called but doesn't affect the returned values directly.  
2. `args = {arg: value for arg, value in params.items() if value is not None}` — only non-None params are kept.  
3. Then we iterate over `self._requests` items (`prop`, `alias`):  
   - If `alias` is `False` or `WARN`, skip.  
   - If `alias` is `True` and `prop` in `args`, add `args[prop]` to `res`.  
   - If `alias` is `None` and `prop` in `args`, add to `unrequested`.  
   - If `alias` (some string) is in `args`, add `args[alias]` to `res` under key `prop`.  

Since output shows `sample_weight: [1]` and `metadata: "a"`, both are in `res` and not in `unrequested`, meaning:  

- For `sample_weight` in `_requests`:  
  - Either `alias` is `True` and `prop` (`sample_weight`) is in `args`, and its value in `params` is `[1]`.  
  - Or `alias` is some other string that is a key in `args`, but that would give us `args[alias]` stored under `sample_weight`, but then we wouldn't know what `alias` is. Let's check simpler case.  

Similarly for `metadata`.  

But wait: The output is exactly the values from `params` for keys `sample_weight` and `metadata`.  
That means both `sample_weight` and `metadata` in `_requests` have `alias = True`, and both are in `args` (so both are not None).  

Let's test:  
If `_requests = {"sample_weight": True, "metadata": True}` and `params = {"sample_weight": [1], "metadata": "a"}`:  
Then `alias` is `True`, `prop` in `args`, so `res[prop] = args[prop] = params[prop]`. Works.

No `unrequested` means no alias `None` and `prop` in `args`. And no `alias` in `args` (string) case either.  

Also `owner`, `method`, `parent`, `caller` don't affect `res` except in the error message if unrequested exists. Since no error, those can be arbitrary strings.

Check `_check_warnings`: If `alias == WARN` and `prop` in `params`, would warn, but that’s fine; but in our case no alias is WARN since no warning mentioned in output. So `alias` is not `WARN`.  

So:  
`self._requests`:  
- `"sample_weight": True`  
- `"metadata": True`  

`params`:  
- `"sample_weight": [1]`  
- `"metadata": "a"`  

`parent` and `caller` can be anything.  
`owner` and `method` arbitrary.  

Thus final input structure fill:  

```json
{
    "self": {
        "_requests": {
            "sample_weight": true,
            "metadata": true
        },
        "owner": "SomeClass",
        "method": "some_method"
    },
    "args": {
        "params": {
            "sample_weight": [1],
            "metadata": "a"
        },
        "parent": "SomeParent",
        "caller": "some_caller"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```  

[THOUGHT]
The output Bunch contains "sample_weight": [1] and "metadata": "a". This means both metadata were requested (alias = True in self._requests) and passed as non-None values in params. No unrequested metadata error was raised, so no alias was None with prop in args. Also no alias was a string pointing to another key in args, since output matches params keys directly. self._check_warnings doesn't affect output values, so alias = WARN possible but would raise warning (not mentioned in output), so likely not WARN. Therefore: _requests maps each to True, params maps each to given values. Other fields (owner, method, parent, caller) are irrelevant for output, so can be placeholders.
