[THOUGHT]
The function sums math.ceil(i) ** 2 for each element i in lst. For simplicity choose integers so ceil(i) == i.

We need integers whose squares sum to 1086.

Check 32^2 = 1024, remainder 1086 - 1024 = 62.
62 can be decomposed: 7^2 = 49, remainder 13.
13 = 3^2 (9) + 2^2 (4).

So 32^2 + 7^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1024 + 49 + 9 + 4 = 1086.

Thus lst = [32, 7, 3, 2] will produce the desired output.
