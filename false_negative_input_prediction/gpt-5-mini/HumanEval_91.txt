def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1

0

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
The function splits S by punctuation followed by optional whitespace into 'sentences' and counts how many sentences start with the two-character prefix "I ".

To get output 0, none of the resulting sentences can start with "I ". The simplest input is the empty string:
- re.split('[.?!]\\s*', '') -> ['']
- For the single sentence '', sentence[0:2] == 'I ' is False
- sum(...) -> 0

Therefore S can be "".
