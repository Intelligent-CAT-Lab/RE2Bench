[THOUGHT]
The function computes the average of integers from n to m inclusive. Summation/(m-n+1) simplifies to (n + m) / 2, then it returns bin(round((n + m) / 2)).

The desired output is "0b101101110", which as an integer is:
0b101101110 = 256 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 366.

So we need round((n + m) / 2) == 366. The simplest choice is (n + m) / 2 == 366 exactly, e.g. n + m = 732. The simplest pair satisfying that with m >= n is n = 366, m = 366. Then average = 366, round -> 366, bin(366) -> "0b101101110".
