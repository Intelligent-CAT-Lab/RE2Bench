a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
if a <= 0 and 0 <= b :
    print ( "Zero" )
elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 :
    print ( "Negative" )
else :
    print ( "Positive" )

[THOUGHT]
The code reads two integers a and b.

- If a <= 0 <= b it prints "Zero".
- Else if a < 0 and min(b - a, -a) is even it prints "Negative".
- Otherwise it prints "Positive".

To get "Positive" easiest is to make a > 0 so both previous conditions are false. For example a = 1, b = 2.
