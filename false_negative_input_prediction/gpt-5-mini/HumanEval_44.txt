[THOUGHT]
The function builds the base representation by repeatedly taking x % base and prepending it. To get the output "4" (a single-character string), the loop must run exactly once, so after the first division x //= base the value must become 0; therefore the initial x must be less than base and greater than 0. The returned string will then be str(x % base) which equals str(x). To match "4" we need x == 4. Also base must be > 4 (so x < base). Many choices for base satisfy this (5, 6, 10, ...). I'll choose the common base 10.
