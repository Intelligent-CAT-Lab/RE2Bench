    suitable for a pivot.  If ``col`` consists only of

    Otherwise, the first element where ``iszerofunc`` returns
    False is used.  If ``iszerofunc`` does not return false,
    items are simplified and retested until a suitable
    pivot is found.

<<GROUND_TRUTH_INPUT>>

{'self': {}, 'args': {'col': ['-9', '-10', '-21'], 'iszerofunc': '<function _iszero at 0x755447f77240>', 'simpfunc': '<function _simplify at 0x755447f77380>'}, 'kwargs': {}}

<<GROUND_TRUTH_OUTPUT>>

[0, '-9', False, []]

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

[THOUGHT]
1. The function begins by converting col to a list. To get the returned index 0 and pivot value -9, col[0] must be -9 (a SymPy Integer or a plain int).
2. The early return happens in the first pass (PASS 1): it calls iszerofunc(x) for each x in col; if iszerofunc(x) == False it immediately returns (i, x, False, newly_determined). So for i = 0 we need iszerofunc(col[0]) to be False.
3. For a SymPy Integer(-9) (or a plain int wrapped by SymPy), the default iszerofunc (_iszero) returns getattr(x, 'is_zero', None). For Integer(-9), x.is_zero is False, so iszerofunc returns False and the function returns (0, -9, False, []).
4. simpfunc is not used in this early-return path.
5. Therefore the input should have col as a list with -9 as its first (and only necessary) element, and iszerofunc set to the default _iszero (simpfunc to _simplify, though it won't be used).
