[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers a and b.

First loop runs a times, so after it:
- h = a
- s = a

Second loop runs while s >= b. Each iteration increases h by 1 and sets s = s - (b - 1). If a < b the second loop never runs, so final h = a.

The output printed is 80. The simplest way to get h = 80 is to have a = 80 and ensure the second loop does not run, i.e., b > a. Choose b = 81 as a minimal such b. Then h = a = 80 and the program prints 80.
