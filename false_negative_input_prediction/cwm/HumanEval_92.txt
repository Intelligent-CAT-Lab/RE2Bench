To determine the input of `any_int` given the output `true`, we need to consider the conditions under which the function returns `True`. The function `any_int` checks if all three inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers and if any two of them sum up to the third.

1. **Condition for returning True**: The function returns `True` if:
   - All inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers.
   - The sum of any two inputs equals the third input.

2. **Given Output is True**: Since the output is `true`, it means the conditions for returning `True` are met.

Let's consider possible integer values for `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy these conditions.

- One possible combination is when two of the numbers are the same and the third is their sum. However, since all must be distinct for the sum condition to hold (if two are the same, their sum would be double one of them, which would not equal the third unless the third is also the same, violating the distinctness), we look for distinct integers.
- Another possibility is when one number is the sum of the other two.

A straightforward example that satisfies these conditions is when `x`, `y`, and `z` are `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. Here, `1 + 2 = 3`, which meets the condition.

Therefore, the input that could result in the given output is when `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`.
