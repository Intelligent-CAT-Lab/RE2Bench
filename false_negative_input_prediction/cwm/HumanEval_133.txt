1086

<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

To find the input that would result in the output `1086` for the `sum_squares` function, let's analyze the function's behavior:

1. The function iterates over each element `i` in the input list `lst`.
2. For each `i`, it calculates `math.ceil(i) ** 2` and adds this to the `squared` variable.
3. Finally, it returns the total sum of squares calculated.

Given that the output is `1086`, we need to find a list of numbers where the sum of the squares of their ceilings equals `1086`.

Let's try different combinations of numbers and their squares to see which combination sums up to `1086`:

- The square root of `1086` is approximately `32.94`. This means the largest number in the list, when squared, cannot exceed `1086`, so it must be less than or equal to `32`.
- If we consider the squares of numbers from `1` to `32`, we can start finding combinations that add up to `1086`.

One possible combination could involve numbers whose squares are close to but not exceeding `1086`. For example, using `32` (since `32^2 = 1024`) leaves us with `62` to reach `1086`. However, `62` is not a perfect square, suggesting we might need to combine squares of smaller numbers to reach this sum.

Let's consider a combination:
- `32^2 = 1024`, leaving `62` to be made up of smaller squares.
- The next largest square less than `62` is `49` (which is `7^2`), leaving `13`.
- The next largest square less than `13` is `9` (which is `3^2`), leaving `4`.
- The square of `2` is `4`, which exactly covers the remaining sum.

Thus, a possible input list could be `[32, 7, 3, 2]`, but since the function uses `math.ceil(i)`, the actual input numbers could be slightly less than these values, as long as their ceiling matches the required values. However, for simplicity and to ensure the ceiling function results in the exact numbers we've considered, we can use the integers themselves as inputs because `math.ceil` of an integer is the integer itself.

Therefore, the input to achieve an output of `1086` could be a list containing the numbers `32`, `7`, `3`, and `2`.
