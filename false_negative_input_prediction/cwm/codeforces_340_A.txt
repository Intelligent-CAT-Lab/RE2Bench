I need to find the input that results in the output `57900` for the given Python code. Let's break down the code step by step to understand how it works.

The code defines two functions: `GCD` (Greatest Common Divisor) and `LCM` (Least Common Multiple). The `LCM` function uses the `GCD` function to calculate the LCM of two numbers using the formula `LCM(a, b) = a * b // GCD(a, b)`.

The main part of the code reads input from the user, splits it into four integers `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`, and calculates the LCM of `x` and `y`. Then, it prints the result of the expression `b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm`.

Let's denote the LCM of `x` and `y` as `lcm`. The expression `b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm` calculates the number of multiples of `lcm` in the range `[a, b]`.

To find the input that results in the output `57900`, we need to find values of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` such that the number of multiples of `lcm` in the range `[a, b]` is `57900`.

One approach is to choose `x` and `y` such that their LCM is a large number, and then choose `a` and `b` such that the range `[a, b]` contains exactly `57900` multiples of `lcm`.

Let's assume `x = 1` and `y = 1`, so `lcm = 1`. Then, we need to find `a` and `b` such that `b - a + 1 = 57900`. For example, we can choose `a = 1` and `b = 57900`.

However, this might not be the only possible solution. There could be other values of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` that result in the same output.

But based on the given output, one possible input is `1 1 1 57900`.
