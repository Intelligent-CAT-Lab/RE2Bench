    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.

Let's analyze the problem step by step. 

The function `compare` takes two parameters, `game` and `guess`, which are presumably lists or sequences of numbers. The function returns a new list where each element is the absolute difference between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.

Given the output:
[
    2,
    0,
    0,
    1
]

This means that for each position in the lists, the absolute difference between the elements of `game` and `guess` is as shown.

Let's denote the elements of `game` as \(g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4\) and the elements of `guess` as \(h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4\). 

From the output, we have the following equations:
1. \(|g_1 - h_1| = 2\)
2. \(|g_2 - h_2| = 0\)
3. \(|g_3 - h_3| = 0\)
4. \(|g_4 - h_4| = 1\)

Since \(|g_2 - h_2| = 0\), it implies that \(g_2 = h_2\). Similarly, \(g_3 = h_3\).

Let's assign some values to `game` and `guess` based on these conditions. For simplicity, let's assume `game` is \([a, b, b, c]\) and `guess` is \([d, b, b, e]\), where:
- \(|a - d| = 2\)
- \(|c - e| = 1\)

We need to find values for \(a\), \(d\), \(c\), and \(e\) that satisfy these conditions.

Let's pick some numbers:
- Let \(a = 5\), then \(d\) could be \(3\) (since \(|5 - 3| = 2\)).
- Let \(c = 4\), then \(e\) could be \(5\) (since \(|4 - 5| = 1\)).

Thus, `game` could be \([5, 2, 2, 4]\) and `guess` could be \([3, 2, 2, 5]\).

Let's verify:
- \(|5 - 3| = 2\)
- \(|2 - 2| = 0\)
- \(|2 - 2| = 0\)
- \(|4 - 5| = 1\)

This matches the output. Therefore, the input to the function `compare` could be `game = [5, 2, 2, 4]` and `guess = [3, 2, 2, 5]`.
