Let's analyze the given code and output to determine the input. The code takes two integers, `h` and `a`, from the input and calculates `math.ceil(h / a)`. The output is 6. 

To find the input, we need to find integers `h` and `a` such that when `h` is divided by `a` and the result is rounded up to the nearest integer, it equals 6. This means `h / a` must be a number that, when rounded up, equals 6. The smallest such number is 5.000...1, but since `h` and `a` are integers, we look for a fraction that is just over 5. 

Possible pairs could be `h = 29` and `a = 5`, because `29 / 5 = 5.8`, and `math.ceil(5.8) = 6`. Another possible pair is `h = 30` and `a = 5`, because `30 / 5 = 6`, and `math.ceil(6) = 6`. However, since the problem asks for the input, we need to consider the smallest possible values that satisfy the condition to ensure uniqueness. 

Let's verify with `h = 29` and `a = 5`: `math.ceil(29 / 5) = math.ceil(5.8) = 6`, which matches the output. 

Therefore, the input should be `29 5`.
