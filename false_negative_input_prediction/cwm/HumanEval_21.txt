Let's analyze the output to determine the input. The output is a list of numbers that have been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1]. This means each number in the output is a transformed version of a number in the input list, where the smallest number in the input becomes 0.0 and the largest becomes 1.0.

The output list is: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]. This suggests the input list has 5 numbers, and they are evenly spaced when rescaled. The original numbers must have been in an arithmetic progression.

Given the output values, we can infer the following:

- The smallest number in the input list is transformed to 0.0.
- The largest number is transformed to 1.0.
- The middle number is transformed to 0.5, which would be the average of the smallest and largest numbers.

Let's denote the smallest number as 'a' and the largest as 'b'. The input list would be something like [a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, b], where 'd' is the common difference.

Since the output for the middle element (third element) is 0.5, we have:
(a + 2d - a) / (b - a) = 0.5
2d / (b - a) = 0.5
This implies that b - a = 4d.

Also, the second element in the output is 0.25, which corresponds to (a + d - a) / (b - a) = 0.25
d / (b - a) = 0.25
Again, this gives us b - a = 4d, confirming our previous result.

The fourth element in the output is 0.75, which should correspond to (a + 3d - a) / (b - a) = 0.75
3d / (b - a) = 0.75
This also aligns with b - a = 4d.

Now, let's find 'a' and 'b'. The output for the second element is 0.25, which is (a + d - a) / (b - a) = d / (b - a) = 0.25
Since b - a = 4d, we can substitute:
d / 4d = 0.25, which is true.

However, to find the actual values of 'a' and 'b', we need more information. But since the output is evenly spaced, we can assume the input list is also evenly spaced. Let's consider a simple case where the input list is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 

Applying the rescale function:
min_number = 0, max_number = 4
(0-0)/(4-0) = 0.0
(1-0)/(4-0) = 0.25
(2-0)/(4-0) = 0.5
(3-0)/(4-0) = 0.75
(4-0)/(4-0) = 1.0

This matches the output exactly. Therefore, the input list must be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
