<think>

To solve this, let's analyze the function and the output provided. The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring, then returns a list of strings that contain the substring.

Given the output is `["grunt", "prune"]`, we need to figure out what the original list of strings and the substring could have been.

First, observe that both "grunt" and "prune" contain the substring "run". This is a common substring between the two words. 

Therefore, the input list of strings must have included "grunt" and "prune", and possibly other words that do not contain "run". The substring used for filtering must have been "run".

So, the input would look something like this: a list containing "grunt", "prune", and maybe other words not containing "run", along with the substring "run".
