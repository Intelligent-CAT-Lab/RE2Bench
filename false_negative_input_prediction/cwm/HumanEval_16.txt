Let's work backwards from the given output to determine the input string. The function `count_distinct_characters` converts the input string to lowercase and counts the number of unique characters.

Given the output is 5, we know there must be exactly 5 distinct characters in the input string after converting it to lowercase.

To get 5 distinct characters, the string could be something like "abcde", "aAbBc", "abcdeabcde", etc., but since we're counting unique characters, the actual length of the string doesn't matter, just the unique letters.

So, the simplest form would be a string that contains exactly 5 unique characters. Let's choose "abcde" for simplicity. 

We should check if this satisfies the condition:
- Lowercase: "abcde"
- Unique characters: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}
- Count: 5

Yes, that works.
