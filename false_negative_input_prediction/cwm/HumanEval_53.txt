<think>
The function `add` simply returns the sum of two integers, `x` and `y`. Given the output `1223`, I need to find two integers that add up to this value.

The output `1223` suggests that the sum of `x` and `y` equals `1223`. There are many possible pairs of integers that could sum to `1223`. For simplicity, I can choose values that are close to each other or values that are easy to work with. For example, `x` could be `611` and `y` could be `612`, because `611 + 612 = 1223`.

However, without additional information about the expected values of `x` and `y`, I can also consider more straightforward pairs, such as `x = 1` and `y = 1222` or `x = 0` and `y = 1223`. Since the problem does not specify any constraints on the values of `x` and `y` other than they must be integers, any of these pairs would be valid.

For the purpose of this exercise, I will choose `x = 611` and `y = 612` as the input values.
