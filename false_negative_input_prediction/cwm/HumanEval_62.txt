To find the input `xs` given the output `[2, 2, 0, 16]`, let's analyze how the function `derivative` works. 

The function `derivative` takes a list `xs` and computes the first derivative of the sequence. This is done by calculating the differences between consecutive elements, effectively returning the slope between each pair of consecutive points.

The formula used in the function is `[i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]`. This can be broken down as follows:
1. `enumerate(xs)` pairs each element `x` in `xs` with its index `i`.
2. `i * x` calculates the product of the index `i` and the element `x` at that index.
3. The list comprehension `[i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs)]` generates a list of these products.
4. `[1:]` slices this list to exclude the first element (since the first derivative starts from the second element).

Given the output `[2, 2, 0, 16]`, we need to determine the original list `xs` that would produce this output after applying the `derivative` function.

Let's denote the original list `xs` as `[x0, x1, x2, x3, x4]`. The first derivative would then be calculated as:
- `1 * x1` (since index starts at 0, the first element to be considered for the derivative is `x1` at index 1)
- `2 * x2`
- `3 * x3`
- `4 * x4`

So, the output `[2, 2, 0, 16]` corresponds to:
- `1 * x1 = 2` → `x1 = 2`
- `2 * x2 = 2` → `x2 = 1`
- `3 * x3 = 0` → `x3 = 0`
- `4 * x4 = 16` → `x4 = 4`

Therefore, the original list `xs` must be `[x0, 2, 1, 0, 4]`. However, since the first element `x0` is not used in the derivative calculation (as the derivative starts from the second element), its value can be any number because it doesn't affect the output. For simplicity, we can assume `x0 = 0` (though it could be any number).

Thus, the input `xs` is `[0, 2, 1, 0, 4]`.
