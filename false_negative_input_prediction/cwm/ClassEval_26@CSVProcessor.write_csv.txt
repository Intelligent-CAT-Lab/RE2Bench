<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

<think>
The function `write_csv` returns 1 if the CSV file is written successfully and 0 if an exception occurs. Given that the output is 1, we know the operation was successful. This means the file was created, and the data was written without any errors.

To reverse-engineer the input, we need to consider what data and file name would result in a successful write operation. A common test case is writing a simple dataset to a file. Let's assume the data is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the CSV file. For example, `[['Name', 'Age'], ['Alice', 30], ['Bob', 25]]` could be written to a file named 'test.csv'.

Therefore, the input arguments would likely be:
- `data`: A list of lists containing the data to be written.
- `file_name`: The name of the file to be created, including the '.csv' extension.

Since the exact data and file name are not specified in the output, we'll use a generic example that could lead to a successful write operation.
