I need to figure out what input to the `_consumes_sample_weight` function would result in the output `{"output": false}`.

First, let me understand what the function does. The function checks if an estimator consumes sample weights. If metadata routing is enabled, it uses `get_routing_for_object` to check the request or router. Otherwise, it uses `has_fit_parameter` to check if the estimator's `fit` method has a `sample_weight` parameter.

The output is `False`, which means the estimator does not consume sample weight. This could happen in two scenarios:

1. Metadata routing is enabled, but the estimator's request or router does not consume `sample_weight` in the `fit` method.
2. Metadata routing is disabled, and the estimator's `fit` method does not have a `sample_weight` parameter.

To get the simplest input that leads to this output, I'll consider the case where metadata routing is disabled. In this case, the function calls `has_fit_parameter(estimator, 'sample_weight')`.

If `has_fit_parameter` returns `False`, then the output of `_consumes_sample_weight` will be `False`. This happens when the estimator does not have a `fit` method or when the `fit` method does not accept a `sample_weight` parameter.

Let's choose an estimator that does not have a `fit` method or whose `fit` method does not include `sample_weight`. A simple example is a class that doesn't implement `fit`, like a basic object or a class without a `fit` method.

For instance, if the estimator is an instance of a class that doesn't have a `fit` method, then `has_fit_parameter` will return `False`, leading to the output `False`.
