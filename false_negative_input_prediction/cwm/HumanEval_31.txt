<<LLM_RESPONSE>>

To determine the input for the `is_prime` function given the output is `True`, we need to understand what makes a number prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-2` (since `range(2, n - 1)` in Python stops at `n-2`) and checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the function returns `False`, indicating `n` is not prime. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`, indicating `n` is prime.

Given that the output is `True`, we know `n` must be a prime number. The smallest prime number is 2, but since the loop in the function starts from 2 and goes up to `n-2`, the function would not correctly identify 2 as prime because the loop would not run (range would be empty). However, the condition `if n < 2: return False` would correctly identify 2 as not less than 2, but since 2 is the only even prime number and the loop doesn't check for it, we need to consider the next prime numbers.

The next prime number is 3. For `n = 3`, the loop `for k in range(2, n - 1)` becomes `for k in range(2, 2)`, which does not execute because the start of the range is not less than the stop. Thus, the function would return `True` for `n = 3`, which is correct.

Therefore, the input that would result in the output `True` for the `is_prime` function is when `n` equals 3.
