Let's think about how the code works step by step.

The code takes two integers `t` and `h` as input, and then calculates and prints the result of the expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`.

The output is 2, so let's work backwards to find the possible values of `t` and `h`.

The expression can be rewritten as:
```
result = (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1
```
We know that the result is 2, so:
```
2 = (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1
```
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
```
1 = (h - 2) // (t - 1)
```
This means that `(h - 2)` divided by `(t - 1)` equals 1 (since integer division `//` truncates the result to an integer).

So, `(h - 2)` must be equal to `(t - 1)`, because when you divide a number by itself, you get 1.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
```
h - 2 = t - 1
```
Simplifying this equation gives:
```
h = t + 1
```
Now, we need to find integer values of `t` and `h` that satisfy this equation and also make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's try some values for `t` and see what `h` would be:

* If `t = 3`, then `h = 4`. Plugging these values into the original expression gives:
```
(4 - 2) // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
```
This works!

So, one possible input is `t = 3` and `h = 4`.

Therefore, the input to the code would be:
```
3 4
```
Here is the input in the required format:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "3 4"
}
```
