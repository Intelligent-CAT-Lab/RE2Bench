[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code step by step.

1. The code reads a line of input and splits it into two integers: `S` and `W`
2. It then checks: if `S <= W`, print 'unsafe', else print 'safe'
3. The output is 'unsafe', which means the condition `S <= W` must be True

So I need to find values of S and W where S <= W.

The code doesn't specify what those values should be, so I just need any pair where S <= W.

Some valid examples:
- S = 1, W = 1 (1 <= 1 is True)
- S = 1, W = 2 (1 <= 2 is True)
- S = 0, W = 0 (0 <= 0 is True)
- S = 5, W = 10 (5 <= 10 is True)

I'll choose a simple example: S = 1, W = 2 (or any values where S <= W)

Let me verify: 
- Input: "1 2"
- S = 1, W = 2
- Check: 1 <= 2? Yes, True
- Print: 'unsafe' ✓

This matches the expected output.
