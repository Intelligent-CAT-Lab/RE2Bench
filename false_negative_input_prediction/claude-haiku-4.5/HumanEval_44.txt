[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what inputs would produce output "4".

The function `change_base(x: int, base: int)` converts an integer `x` to a given `base`.

Starting with the output "4", this means:
- The function returned the string "4"
- This string is built by the while loop: `ret = str(x % base) + ret`

Working backwards:
1. The final output is "4", which is a single character string
2. For the output to be just "4", the while loop must have executed exactly once
3. In the first iteration: `ret = str(x % base) + "" = "4"`, so `x % base = 4`
4. Then: `x //= base`
5. For the loop to exit after one iteration, after the division `x` must become 0

So we need:
- `x % base = 4` (to get the digit "4")
- `x // base = 0` (so the loop exits)

The condition `x // base = 0` means `x < base`.
Combined with `x % base = 4`, we need `x = 4` and `base > 4`.

Let me verify with `x = 4, base = 5`:
- Initial: `x = 4, ret = ""`
- Iteration 1: `ret = str(4 % 5) + "" = "4"`, then `x = 4 // 5 = 0`
- Loop condition: `x > 0` is False, so exit
- Return "4" ✓

This works! In fact, any base > 4 would work (base = 5, 6, 7, ...), but the most natural choice would be base = 5 or a common base. Let me check if base = 10 works:
- Initial: `x = 4, ret = ""`
- Iteration 1: `ret = str(4 % 10) + "" = "4"`, then `x = 4 // 10 = 0`
- Loop condition: `x > 0` is False, so exit
- Return "4" ✓

Base 10 is the most common, so I'll use that. But actually, base = 5 is also a valid simple choice.
