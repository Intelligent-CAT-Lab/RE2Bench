[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function `_mac_arch` to determine what inputs would produce the output "i386".

The function has this logic:
1. If `is_32bit` is False, return `arch` as-is
2. If `is_32bit` is True:
   - If `arch` starts with 'ppc', return 'ppc'
   - Otherwise, return 'i386'

Given the output is "i386", let me consider the cases:

Case 1: `is_32bit` is False
- The function returns `arch` directly
- So `arch` would need to be "i386"
- This is possible

Case 2: `is_32bit` is True
- If `arch` starts with 'ppc', it returns 'ppc' (not "i386")
- If `arch` does NOT start with 'ppc', it returns 'i386' (matches our output!)
- So `arch` could be anything that doesn't start with 'ppc'

The most straightforward solution is:
- `is_32bit` = True (since the default is `_32_BIT_INTERPRETER` which is typically True on 32-bit systems)
- `arch` = any string that doesn't start with 'ppc', for example "i386", "x86_64", "arm64", etc.

The simplest and most likely scenario given the output is:
- `is_32bit` = True
- `arch` = "i386" (or any non-ppc value)

Let me go with `arch = "i386"` and `is_32bit = True` as this directly produces the output "i386" when the non-ppc path is taken.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider. If `is_32bit = False`, then it returns `arch` unchanged. So `arch = "i386"` and `is_32bit = False` would also work.

However, the most typical case for getting "i386" as output on a 32-bit system would be when `is_32bit = True` and `arch` is something non-ppc. I'll go with `arch = "i386"` and `is_32bit = True`.
