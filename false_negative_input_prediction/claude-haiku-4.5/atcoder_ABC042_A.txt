[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the code step by step to find what input would produce "YES" as output.

1. `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` - This reads the input, splits it by whitespace, converts each to int, and creates a tuple.

2. `if ABC.count(5) == 2:` - The code checks if the number 5 appears exactly 2 times in the tuple ABC.

3. If the condition is true, it checks: `print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')`
   - If the sum of all elements equals 17, print 'YES'
   - Otherwise print 'NO'

4. If the condition is false (count of 5 is not 2), it prints 'NO'

For the output to be "YES", we need:
- `ABC.count(5) == 2` must be True (meaning exactly two 5's in the tuple)
- `sum(ABC) == 17` must be True (meaning the sum of all elements equals 17)

So we need:
- Exactly two 5's in the tuple
- The sum of all elements = 17

If we have two 5's, that accounts for 10 of the sum. We need the remaining elements to sum to 7.

Some possibilities:
- Two 5's and one 7: `5 5 7` → sum = 17 ✓, count of 5 = 2 ✓
- Two 5's and two numbers that sum to 7: `5 5 3 4` → sum = 17 ✓, count of 5 = 2 ✓
- Many other combinations

The simplest solution would be: `5 5 7`

Let me verify:
- Input: "5 5 7"
- ABC = (5, 5, 7)
- ABC.count(5) = 2 ✓
- sum(ABC) = 5 + 5 + 7 = 17 ✓
- Output: "YES" ✓
