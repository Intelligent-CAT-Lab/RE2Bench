def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]

[THOUGHT]
Let me analyze the function step by step.

The function `compare` takes two arguments `game` and `guess`, and returns a list where each element is the absolute difference between corresponding elements from `game` and `guess`.

The output is `[2, 0, 0, 1]`.

This means:
- `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2`
- `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0`
- `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0`
- `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1`

From the second element: `abs(game[1] - guess[1]) = 0` means `game[1] = guess[1]`

From the third element: `abs(game[2] - guess[2]) = 0` means `game[2] = guess[2]`

For the first element: `abs(game[0] - guess[0]) = 2` could be:
- `game[0] = 5, guess[0] = 3` (difference = 2)
- `game[0] = 3, guess[0] = 5` (difference = 2)
- Or many other combinations like `game[0] = 2, guess[0] = 0` or `game[0] = 0, guess[0] = 2`

For the fourth element: `abs(game[3] - guess[3]) = 1` could be:
- `game[3] = 5, guess[3] = 4` (difference = 1)
- `game[3] = 4, guess[3] = 5` (difference = 1)
- Or many other combinations

Since there are multiple valid solutions, I'll choose simple values:
- For first element with difference 2: `game[0] = 2, guess[0] = 0` (or any other pair with difference 2)
- For second and third elements with difference 0: `game[1] = guess[1]` and `game[2] = guess[2]`, I'll use `game[1] = guess[1] = 1` and `game[2] = guess[2] = 1`
- For fourth element with difference 1: `game[3] = 5, guess[3] = 4` (or any other pair with difference 1)

So one valid input could be:
`game = [2, 1, 1, 5]` and `guess = [0, 1, 1, 4]`

Let me verify:
- `abs(2 - 0) = 2` ✓
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0` ✓
- `abs(1 - 1) = 0` ✓
- `abs(5 - 4) = 1` ✓

This works!
