[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the function to understand what input would produce an output of 0.

The function `f(array, elem)`:
1. Checks if `elem` is in `array`
2. If yes, returns `array.index(elem)` - which returns the index of the first occurrence
3. If no, returns -1

Since the output is 0 (not -1), we know that:
- `elem` must be in `array` (the if condition is true)
- `array.index(elem)` must return 0

For `array.index(elem)` to return 0, the element `elem` must be at index 0 of the array, meaning it's the first element.

So I need:
- `array` to be some list/array with at least one element
- `elem` to be the first element of that array

The simplest solution would be:
- `array = [elem]` (single element array)
- Or `array = [elem, ...]` (array with elem as first element)

For example:
- `array = [1, 2, 3]` and `elem = 1` would work
- `array = ["a", "b"]` and `elem = "a"` would work
- `array = [0]` and `elem = 0` would work

I'll choose a simple case: `array = [1]` and `elem = 1`
This would result in:
- `elem in array` → `1 in [1]` → True
- `array.index(elem)` → `[1].index(1)` → 0
