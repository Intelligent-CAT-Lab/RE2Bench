[THOUGHT]
Looking at the `add_book` method:
1. It takes `title` and `quantity` (default=1) as parameters
2. If the title exists in inventory, it adds the quantity to the existing count
3. If the title doesn't exist, it creates a new entry with that quantity
4. The method returns `null` (implicitly, since there's no return statement)

Given the output is `null` (which is what the method returns), I need to work backwards from the structure provided.

The structure shows:
- `self.inventory` has two books: "book1" and "book2" with unknown quantities
- `args.title` is unknown
- `kwargs` is empty (meaning `quantity` uses its default value of 1)

Since we're adding a book and the method doesn't return anything (returns None/null), I need to figure out what state the inventory should be in after the call.

The structure is asking me to fill in the inventory values after the method executes. Without additional constraints, I need to make a reasonable assumption:

If `add_book` is called with a new title (not in the existing books), the inventory would be updated with that new book. Or if called with an existing title, it would increment that book's quantity.

Let me assume:
- The inventory starts with some books
- We call `add_book` with one of those titles or a new one
- The method executes and returns None

A reasonable scenario: 
- Initial inventory has book1 with quantity 5 and book2 with quantity 3
- We call `add_book("book1")` with default quantity=1
- After execution, book1 would have 6 and book2 would have 3

Or alternatively:
- Initial inventory has book1 with 10 and book2 with 5
- We call `add_book("book2")` 
- After, book1=10, book2=6

Without loss of generality, let me pick: initial state book1=5, book2=3, and we call add_book with title="book1" (or "book2"), which would increment one of them by 1 (default quantity).

Let me go with: book1 starts at 5, book2 starts at 3, we add to book1, so after the call book1=6, book2=3.
