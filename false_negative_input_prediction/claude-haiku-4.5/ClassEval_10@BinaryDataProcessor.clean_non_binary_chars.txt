[THOUGHT]
The `clean_non_binary_chars` method doesn't return anything (it returns `None` implicitly), which matches the output `null`.

The method filters the `binary_string` to keep only characters '0' and '1', removing all other characters. It then assigns this filtered result back to `self.binary_string`.

Since the output is `null` (which is what the method returns), we need to determine what `self.binary_string` could be when this method is called.

Looking at the code:
- The method `clean_non_binary_chars` is called in `__init__`
- It uses `filter(lambda x: x in '01', self.binary_string)` to keep only binary digits
- The result is joined and assigned back to `self.binary_string`

Since we're only looking at the output of `clean_non_binary_chars` which is `null`, any initial `binary_string` value would work. The method modifies the internal state but always returns `None`.

The simplest input would be any string. Common test cases might be:
- An empty string: `""`
- A string with only non-binary characters: `"abc"`
- A string with mixed characters: `"1a0b1c"`
- A string with only binary digits: `"101010"`

Without additional constraints, a reasonable input would be an empty string or a string with only binary characters (which would remain unchanged after filtering).

Let me use a simple string with mixed content to show the filter is working: `"1a0b1"` would result in `"101"` after cleaning, but since we only see the return value (null), any input is technically valid.

I'll go with a string that contains non-binary characters to demonstrate the filtering: `"1a0b1c"`
