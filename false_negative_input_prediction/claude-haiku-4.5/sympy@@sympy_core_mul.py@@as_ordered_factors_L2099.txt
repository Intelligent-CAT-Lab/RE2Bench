    Expression representing multiplication operation for algebraic field.

    .. deprecated:: 1.7

       Using arguments that aren't subclasses of :class:`~.Expr` in core
       operators (:class:`~.Mul`, :class:`~.Add`, and :class:`~.Pow`) is
       deprecated. See :ref:`non-expr-args-deprecated` for details.

    Every argument of ``Mul()`` must be ``Expr``. Infix operator ``*``
    on most scalar objects in SymPy calls this class.

    Another use of ``Mul()`` is to represent the structure of abstract
    multiplication so that its arguments can be substituted to return
    different class. Refer to examples section for this.

    ``Mul()`` evaluates the argument unless ``evaluate=False`` is passed.
    The evaluation logic includes:

    1. Flattening
        ``Mul(x, Mul(y, z))`` -> ``Mul(x, y, z)``

    2. Identity removing
        ``Mul(x, 1, y)`` -> ``Mul(x, y)``

    3. Exponent collecting by ``.as_base_exp()``
        ``Mul(x, x**2)`` -> ``Pow(x, 3)``

    4. Term sorting
        ``Mul(y, x, 2)`` -> ``Mul(2, x, y)``

    Since multiplication can be vector space operation, arguments may
    have the different :obj:`sympy.core.kind.Kind()`. Kind of the
    resulting object is automatically inferred.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Mul
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Mul(x, 1)
    x
    >>> Mul(x, x)
    x**2

    If ``evaluate=False`` is passed, result is not evaluated.

    >>> Mul(1, 2, evaluate=False)
    1*2
    >>> Mul(x, x, evaluate=False)
    x*x

    ``Mul()`` also represents the general structure of multiplication
    operation.

    >>> from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2,2)
    >>> expr = Mul(x,y).subs({y:A})
    >>> expr
    x*A
    >>> type(expr)

        ===========

        self is treated as a Mul and the ordering of the factors is maintained.
        If ``cset`` is True the commutative factors will be returned in a set.
        If there were repeated factors (as may happen with an unevaluated Mul)
        then an error will be raised unless it is explicitly suppressed by
        setting ``warn`` to False.

        Note: -1 is always separated from a Number unless split_1 is False.

[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through the `as_ordered_factors` method to understand what input would produce the output `["w", "z"]`.

The method does:
1. `cpart, ncpart = self.args_cnc()` - splits args into commutative and non-commutative parts
2. `cpart.sort(key=lambda expr: expr.sort_key(order=order))` - sorts commutative parts
3. Returns `cpart + ncpart` - concatenates sorted commutative with non-commutative parts

The output is `["w", "z"]`, which are two symbols.

For the output to be `["w", "z"]`:
- These must be the result of `cpart + ncpart` after sorting
- Since we get symbols "w" and "z", they're likely commutative (no non-commutative symbols in output)
- So `ncpart = []` and `cpart` after sorting = `["w", "z"]`

For `cpart` to be `["w", "z"]` after sorting by `sort_key()`:
- The unsorted `cpart` from `args_cnc()` must contain symbols that when sorted give `["w", "z"]`
- Symbols sort alphabetically, so "w" < "z" in sort order
- The input `self` must be a `Mul` expression with commutative arguments

The `args_cnc()` method:
- Calls `Mul.make_args(self)` to get args
- Checks each arg for `is_commutative`
- If all are commutative (which would be the case for `w*z`), `c = args` and `nc = []`
- If the first commutative arg is a negative number (not -1) with `split_1=True`, it gets split
- Since our output has no -1, either: there's no negative number, or it's already -1, or `split_1=False`

So `self` is likely a `Mul` with args that when processed give commutative factors `["w", "z"]`.

The simplest case: `self` is a multiplication of two symbols `w` and `z`.

In SymPy, this would be `Mul(w, z)` or `w*z` where `w` and `z` are Symbol objects.

Since the output shows string representations `"w"` and `"z"`, the actual Mul object would contain Symbol objects that stringify to these.

For `order=None` (the default), sorting by `sort_key()` on symbols would give them in alphabetical order.

So the input `self` should be a `Mul` object representing `w*z` or `z*w` (if unsorted, sorting would give `w*z`).

Actually, looking at the output format more carefully - it's a list of strings. But `as_ordered_factors` returns actual Expr objects. The output shown is likely the string representation of the result.

So `self` should be: A Mul expression with Symbol arguments "w" and "z" in any order, and `order=None`.

A reasonable input would be: `Mul(Symbol('w'), Symbol('z'))` or equivalent.

Since we're given it as a structure to fill, and `self` is of type that has `args_cnc()` method (which is a Mul), let me represent this as the actual object or a serializable form.

For the JSON structure, we need to represent the Mul object. Looking at the structure, `self` should be a representation of a Mul expression.

The `self` would be a `Mul` with two Symbol arguments: `w` and `z`.

For `order`: It defaults to None in the function signature, so we should set it to `null`.

`kwargs`: Empty dict `{}`

Let me construct the input assuming we need to represent the expression `w*z`:
- `self` should represent `Mul(w, z)` or similar
- `order` should be `null` (None)
- `kwargs` should be `{}`

For serialization purposes in JSON, I'll represent `self` as a Mul object with Symbol arguments.
