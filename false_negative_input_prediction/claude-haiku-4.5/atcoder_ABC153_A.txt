[THOUGHT]
Let me trace through this code:

1. The code reads two integers `h` and `a` from input (space-separated)
2. It calculates `math.ceil(h / a)` which is the ceiling of h divided by a
3. The output is 6

So I need to find values of h and a such that `math.ceil(h / a) = 6`

The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. So:
- `math.ceil(h / a) = 6` means that `5 < h/a ≤ 6`
- This means `5*a < h ≤ 6*a`

Let me find simple values that satisfy this:
- If a = 1: then 5 < h ≤ 6, so h could be 6
  - Check: math.ceil(6/1) = math.ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓

Let me verify: h=6, a=1
- h/a = 6/1 = 6.0
- math.ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓

This works! Other possibilities would include:
- h=11, a=2: 11/2 = 5.5, ceil(5.5) = 6 ✓
- h=12, a=2: 12/2 = 6.0, ceil(6.0) = 6 ✓
- h=16, a=3: 16/3 = 5.33..., ceil(5.33...) = 6 ✓

I'll go with the simplest case: h=6, a=1
