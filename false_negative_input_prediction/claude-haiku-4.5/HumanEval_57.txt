[THOUGHT]
The function `monotonic` returns `True` if the list `l` is equal to either its sorted version or its reverse-sorted version.

For the output to be `true`, one of these conditions must be satisfied:
1. `l == sorted(l)` (list is sorted in ascending order)
2. `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` (list is sorted in descending order)

Let me think about what lists would satisfy this:
- Any list that is sorted in ascending order would work, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`
- Any list that is sorted in descending order would work, e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`
- Edge cases like empty list `[]` would also work (it's sorted both ways)
- A list with all identical elements like `[1, 1, 1]` would work (it's sorted both ascending and descending)

The simplest examples would be:
- `[]` (empty list)
- `[1]` (single element)
- `[1, 2, 3]` (ascending)
- `[3, 2, 1]` (descending)
- `[1, 1, 1]` (all same)

I'll choose a simple ascending list `[1, 2, 3]` as it clearly demonstrates a monotonic increasing sequence.
